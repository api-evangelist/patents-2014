title: Systems and methods for application-state, distributed replication table cache poisoning
abstract: The present application is directed towards invalidating (also referred to as poisoning) ASDR table entries that are determined to be inaccurate because of changes to a multi-node system. For example, when a node leaves or enters a multi-node system, the ownership of the entries in the ASDR table can change thus invalidating cached and replica entries. More specifically, the system and methods disclosed herein include searching an ASDR table for cached entries responsive to the system determining the multi-node system has changed. After finding a cached entry, the system may determine if the entry should be poisoned. The decision to poison the entry may be responsive to the creation time of the entry, the time when the change to the multi-node system occurred, and in the case of a replica, the owner of the replica's position in a replication chain relative to source of the replica.

The present application generally relates to data communication networks. In particular the present application relates to systems and methods for replicating a distributed hash table across a multi node system.

In single processor systems one processor includes the configuration for maintaining resource persistency. The processor receives all the traffic does load balancing decisions identifies services creates sessions and maintains the sessions. In multi node systems it is challenging to maintain the same configuration and resource persistency across all the nodes of the system.

The present application is directed towards invalidating also referred to as poisoning application state distributed replication table entries that are determined to be inaccurate because of changes to a multi node system. For example when a node leaves or enters a multi node system the ownership of the entries in the application state distributed replication table can change thus invalidating cached and replica entries. More specifically the system and methods disclosed herein include searching an application state distributed replication table for cached entries responsive to the system determining the multi node system has changed. After finding a cached entry the system may determine if the entry should be poisoned. The decision to poison the entry may be responsive to the creation time of the entry the time when the change to the multi node system occurred and in the case of a replica the owner of the replica s position in a replication chain relative to source of the replica.

According to one aspect of the disclosure a method for poisoning a cached entry in an application state distributed replication table to track resources of applications across a cluster of nodes includes maintaining across each node in a cluster of nodes the application state distributed replication table. Each of the nodes in the cluster of nodes owns one or more partitions of the application state distributed replication table. The method can also include determining by a first node in the cluster of nodes that a second node exited the cluster. The method can also include identifying by the first node in the cluster of nodes a plurality of entries assigned to the second node and stored in cache by the first node. The first node can also mark the identified entries as belonging to a third node in the cluster of nodes and obtain each of the marked entries from the third node.

In some implementations the method also includes setting the identified entries to an unusable value or purging the entries from the application state distributed replication table. The method can also include determining a last time the identified entries were accessed or updated. In some implementations obtaining each of the marked entries from the third node can be responsive to the last time the identified entries were accessed or updated being greater than a predetermined amount of time.

The method can include determining by the first node in the cluster of nodes whether the first node was within a replication chain of the second node. The replication chain includes a plurality of nodes to which a node in the cluster of nodes replicates the entries in the one or more partitions it owns. The method can further include marking each of the identified plurality of entries as a replica copy.

In some implementations the method can include obtaining each of the marked entries from the third node responsive to receiving a request for one of the identified plurality of entries assigned to the second node and stored in cache by the first node. The third node can be a new owner node of the identified plurality of entries previously assigned to the second node or a node that stores a replica of each of the identified plurality of entries previously assigned to the second node.

According to another aspect of the disclosure a system for poisoning a cached entry in an application state distributed replication table to track resources of applications across a cluster of nodes includes a cluster of nodes. Each of the cluster of nodes can be configured to maintain an application state distributed replication table. Each of the nodes in the cluster of nodes own one or more partitions of the application state distributed replication table. The system includes a first node that is configured to determine that a second node exited the cluster. The first node is also configured to identify a plurality of entries assigned to the second node and stored in cache by the first node. The first node can also mark the identified entries as belonging to a third node in the cluster of nodes and obtain each of the marked entries from the third node.

In some implementations the first node is also configured to mark the identified entries to an unusable value and or to purge the identified entries from the application state distributed replication table. The first node can also be configured to determine a last time the identified entries were accessed or updated. The first node can also be configured to obtain each of the marked entries from the third node responsive to the last time the identified entries were accessed or updated being greater than a predetermined amount of time.

In some implementations the first node can also be configured to determine whether the first node was within a replication chain of the second node. The replication chain includes a plurality of nodes to which the second node in the cluster of nodes replicates the entries in the one or more partitions it owns. If the first node is within the replication chain the first node can be configured to mark each of the identified plurality of entries as a replica copy.

The first node can also be configured to obtain each of the marked entries from the third node responsive to receiving a request for one of the identified plurality of entries assigned to the second node and stored in cache by the first node. In some implementations the third node is a new owner node of the identified plurality of entries previously assigned to the second node or stores a replica of each of the identified plurality of entries previously assigned to the second node.

Likewise core 3 may perform SSL offloading while core 4 may perform layer 7 or application layer processing and traffic management. Each of the cores may perform the same function or different functions. Each of the cores may perform more than one function. Any of the cores may run any of the functionality or portions thereof identified and or described in conjunction with . In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of performance or load .

In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of load or performance.

The functionality or tasks may be distributed in any arrangement and scheme. For example illustrates a first core Core 1 A processing applications and processes associated with network I O functionality A. Network traffic associated with network I O in some embodiments can be associated with a particular port number. Thus outgoing and incoming packets having a port destination associated with NW I O A will be directed towards Core 1 A which is dedicated to handling all network traffic associated with the NW I O port. Similarly Core 2 B is dedicated to handling functionality associated with SSL processing and Core 4 D may be dedicated handling all TCP level processing and functionality.

While illustrates functions such as network I O SSL and TCP other functions can be assigned to cores. These other functions can include any one or more of the functions or operations described herein. For example any of the functions described in conjunction with may be distributed across the cores on a functionality basis. In some cases a first VIP A may run on a first core while a second VIP B with a different configuration may run on a second core. In some embodiments each core can handle a particular functionality such that each core can handle the processing associated with that particular function. For example Core 2 B may handle SSL offloading while Core 4 D may handle application layer processing and traffic management.

In other embodiments work load or network traffic may be distributed among cores according to any type and form of data parallelism . In some embodiments data parallelism may be achieved in a multi core system by each core performing the same task or functionally on different pieces of distributed data. In some embodiments a single execution thread or code controls operations on all pieces of data. In other embodiments different threads or instructions control the operation but may execute the same code. In some embodiments data parallelism is achieved from the perspective of a packet engine vServers VIPs A C network interface cards NIC D E and or any other networking hardware or software included on or associated with an appliance . For example each core may run the same packet engine or VIP code or configuration but operate on different sets of distributed data. Each networking hardware or software construct can receive different varying or substantially the same amount of data and as a result may have varying different or relatively the same amount of load .

In the case of a data parallelism approach the work may be divided up and distributed based on VIPs NICs and or data flows of the VIPs or NICs. In one of these approaches the work of the multi core system may be divided or distributed among the VIPs by having each VIP work on a distributed set of data. For example each core may be configured to run one or more VIPs. Network traffic may be distributed to the core for each VIP handling that traffic. In another of these approaches the work of the appliance may be divided or distributed among the cores based on which NIC receives the network traffic. For example network traffic of a first NIC may be distributed to a first core while network traffic of a second NIC may be distributed to a second core. In some cases a core may process data from multiple NICs.

While illustrates a single vServer associated with a single core as is the case for VIP1 A VIP2 B and VIP3 C. In some embodiments a single vServer can be associated with one or more cores . In contrast one or more vServers can be associated with a single core . Associating a vServer with a core may include that core to process all functions associated with that particular vServer. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code and configuration. In other embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code but different configuration. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having different code and the same or different configuration.

Like vServers NICs can also be associated with particular cores . In many embodiments NICs can be connected to one or more cores such that when a NIC receives or transmits data packets a particular core handles the processing involved with receiving and transmitting the data packets. In one embodiment a single NIC can be associated with a single core as is the case with NIC D and NIC E. In other embodiments one or more NICs can be associated with a single core . In other embodiments a single NIC can be associated with one or more cores . In these embodiments load could be distributed amongst the one or more cores such that each core processes a substantially similar amount of load. A core associated with a NIC may process all functions and or data associated with that particular NIC.

While distributing work across cores based on data of VIPs or NICs may have a level of independency in some embodiments this may lead to unbalanced use of cores as illustrated by the varying loads of .

In some embodiments load work or network traffic can be distributed among cores based on any type and form of data flow. In another of these approaches the work may be divided or distributed among cores based on data flows. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approaches.

In flow based data parallelism distribution of data is related to any type of flow of data such as request response pairings transactions sessions connections or application communications. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. The distribution of data flow may be such that each core carries a substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed amount of load data or network traffic.

In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approached. In one embodiment data flow can be distributed based on a transaction or a series of transactions. This transaction in some embodiments can be between a client and a server and can be characterized by an IP address or other packet identifier. For example Core 1 A can be dedicated to transactions between a particular client and a particular server therefore the load A on Core 1 A may be comprised of the network traffic associated with the transactions between the particular client and server. Allocating the network traffic to Core 1 A can be accomplished by routing all data packets originating from either the particular client or server to Core 1 A.

While work or load can be distributed to the cores based in part on transactions in other embodiments load or work can be allocated on a per packet basis. In these embodiments the appliance can intercept data packets and allocate them to a core having the least amount of load. For example the appliance could allocate a first incoming data packet to Core 1 A because the load A on Core 1 is less than the load B N on the rest of the cores B N. Once the first data packet is allocated to Core 1 A the amount of load A on Core 1 A is increased proportional to the amount of processing resources needed to process the first data packet. When the appliance intercepts a second data packet the appliance will allocate the load to Core 4 D because Core 4 D has the second least amount of load. Allocating data packets to the core with the least amount of load can in some embodiments ensure that the load A N distributed to each core remains substantially equal.

In other embodiments load can be allocated on a per unit basis where a section of network traffic is allocated to a particular core . The above mentioned example illustrates load balancing on a per packet basis. In other embodiments load can be allocated based on a number of packets such that every 10 100 or 1000 packets are allocated to the core having the least amount of load. The number of packets allocated to a core can be a number determined by an application user or administrator and can be any number greater than zero. In still other embodiments load can be allocated based on a time metric such that packets are distributed to a particular core for a predetermined amount of time. In these embodiments packets can be distributed to a particular core for five milliseconds or for any period of time determined by a user program system administrator or otherwise. After the predetermined time period elapses data packets are transmitted to a different core for the predetermined period of time.

Flow based data parallelism methods for distributing work load or network traffic among the one or more cores can comprise any combination of the above mentioned embodiments. These methods can be carried out by any part of the appliance by an application or set of executable instructions executing on one of the cores such as the packet engine or by any application program or agent executing on a computing device in communication with the appliance .

The functional and data parallelism computing schemes illustrated in can be combined in any manner to generate a hybrid parallelism or distributed processing scheme that encompasses function parallelism data parallelism flow based data parallelism or any portions thereof. In some cases the multi core system may use any type and form of load balancing schemes to distribute load among the one or more cores . The load balancing scheme may be used in any combination with any of the functional and data parallelism schemes or combinations thereof.

The packet engine s A N can in some embodiments be associated with a particular server user client or network. When a packet engine becomes associated with a particular entity that packet engine can process data packets associated with that entity. For example should a packet engine be associated with a first user that packet engine will process and operate on packets generated by the first user or packets having a destination address associated with the first user. Similarly the packet engine may choose not to be associated with a particular entity such that the packet engine can process and otherwise operate on any data packets not generated by that entity or destined for that entity.

A core may have or use memory that is shared or assigned to multiple cores. The memory may be considered public or shared memory that is accessible by more than one core. A core may use any combination of private and public memory. With separate address spaces for each core some level of coordination is eliminated from the case of using the same address space. With a separate address space a core can perform work on information and data in the core s own address space without worrying about conflicts with other cores. Each packet engine may have a separate memory pool for TCP and or SSL connections.

For example one device may comprise two or more cores and another device may comprise two or more cores. For example a multi core system may include a cluster of computing devices a server farm or network of computing devices.

The hardware of the appliance such as a NIC or the kernel may be designed and constructed to support sequential operations across the NICs and or cores.

In embodiments where the system comprises one or more flow distributors each flow distributor can be associated with a processor or a packet engine . The flow distributors can comprise an interface mechanism that allows each flow distributor to communicate with the other flow distributors executing within the system . In one instance the one or more flow distributors can determine how to balance load by communicating with each other. This process can operate substantially similarly to the process described above for submitting votes to an arbiter which then determines which flow distributor should receive the load. In other embodiments a first flow distributor can identify the load on an associated core and determine whether to forward a first data packet to the associated core based on any of the following criteria the load on the associated core is above a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is below a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is less than the load on the other cores or any other metric that can be used to determine where to forward data packets based in part on the amount of load on a processor.

The flow distributor can distribute network traffic among the cores according to a distribution computing or load balancing scheme such as those described herein. In one embodiment the flow distributor can distribute network traffic according to any one of a functional parallelism distribution scheme a data parallelism load distribution scheme a flow based data parallelism distribution scheme or any combination of these distribution scheme or any load balancing scheme for distributing load among multiple processors.

The RSS module can execute within the NIC in some embodiments and in other embodiments can execute on any one of the cores .

In some embodiments the RSS module uses the MICROSOFT receive side scaling RSS scheme. In one embodiment RSS is a Microsoft Scalable Networking initiative technology that enables receive processing to be balanced across multiple processors in the system while maintaining in order delivery of the data. The RSS may use any type and form of hashing scheme to determine a core or processor for processing a network packet.

The RSS module can apply any type and form hash function such as the Toeplitz hash function. The hash function may be applied to the hash type or any the sequence of values. The hash function may be a secure hash of any security level or is otherwise cryptographically secure. The hash function may use a hash key. The size of the key is dependent upon the hash function. For the Toeplitz hash the size may be 40 bytes for IPv6 and 16 bytes for IPv4.

The hash function may be designed and constructed based on any one or more criteria or design goals. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides an even distribution of hash result for different hash inputs and different hash types including TCP IPv4 TCP IPv6 IPv4 and IPv6 headers. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is evenly distributed when a small number of buckets are present for example two or four . In some embodiments hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is randomly distributed when a large number of buckets were present for example 64 buckets . In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on a level of computational or resource usage. In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on ease or difficulty of implementing the hash in hardware. In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on the ease or difficulty of a malicious remote host to send packets that would all hash to the same bucket.

The RSS may generate hashes from any type and form of input such as a sequence of values. This sequence of values can include any portion of the network packet such as any header field or payload of network packet or portions thereof. In some embodiments the input to the hash may be referred to as a hash type and include any tuples of information associated with a network packet or data flow such as any of the following a four tuple comprising at least two IP addresses and two ports a four tuple comprising any four sets of values a six tuple a two tuple and or any other sequence of numbers or values.

The network stack may set the actual number of bits to be used during initialization. The number will be between 1 and 7 inclusive.

The hash result may be used to identify the core or entity via any type and form of table such as a bucket table or indirection table. In some embodiments the number of hash result bits are used to index into the table. The range of the hash mask may effectively define the size of the indirection table. Any portion of the hash result or the hast result itself may be used to index the indirection table. The values in the table may identify any of the cores or processor such as by a core or processor identifier. In some embodiments all of the cores of the multi core system are identified in the table. In other embodiments a port of the cores of the multi core system are identified in the table. The indirection table may comprise any number of buckets for example 2 to 128 buckets that may be indexed by a hash mask.

In some of these embodiments a software steering module not shown or a software embodiment of the RSS module within the system can operate in conjunction with or as part of the flow distributor to steer packets to cores within the multi core system .

The flow distributor in some embodiments executes within any module or program on the appliance on any one of the cores and on any one of the devices or components included within the multi core system . In some embodiments the flow distributor can execute on the first core A while in other embodiments the flow distributor can execute on the NIC . In still other embodiments an instance of the flow distributor can execute on each core included in the multi core system . In this embodiment each instance of the flow distributor can communicate with other instances of the flow distributor to forward packets back and forth across the cores . There exist situations where a response to a request packet may not be processed by the same core i.e. the first core processes the request while the second core processes the response. In these situations the instances of the flow distributor can intercept the packet and forward it to the desired or correct core i.e. a flow distributor instance can forward the response to the first core. Multiple instances of the flow distributor can execute on any number of cores and any combination of cores .

The flow distributor may operate responsive to any one or more rules or policies. The rules may identify a core or packet processing engine to receive a network packet data or data flow. The rules may identify any type and form of tuple information related to a network packet such as a 4 tuple of source and destination IP address and source and destination ports. Based on a received packet matching the tuple specified by the rule the flow distributor may forward the packet to a core or packet engine. In some embodiments the packet is forwarded to a core via shared memory and or core to core messaging.

Although illustrates the flow distributor as executing within the multi core system in some embodiments the flow distributor can execute on a computing device or appliance remotely located from the multi core system . In such an embodiment the flow distributor can communicate with the multi core system to take in data packets and distribute the packets across the one or more cores .

In such an embodiment CISCO s vn tag mechanism can be used to alter or tag each packet with the appropriate meta data.

Illustrated in is an embodiment of a multi core system comprising one or more processing cores A N. In brief overview one of the cores can be designated as a control core A and can be used as a control plane for the other cores . The other cores may be secondary cores which operate in a data plane while the control core provides the control plane. The cores A N may share a global cache . While the control core provides a control plane the other cores in the multi core system form or provide a data plane. These cores perform data processing functionality on network traffic while the control provides initialization configuration and control of the multi core system.

Further referring to and in more detail the cores A N as well as the control core A can be any processor described herein. Furthermore the cores A N and the control core A can be any processor able to function within the system described in . Still further the cores A N and the control core A can be any core or group of cores described herein. The control core may be a different type of core or processor than the other cores. In some embodiments the control may operate a different packet engine or have a packet engine configured differently than the packet engines of the other cores.

Any portion of the memory of each of the cores may be allocated to or used for a global cache that is shared by the cores. In brief overview a predetermined percentage or predetermined amount of each of the memory of each core may be used for the global cache. For example 50 of each memory of each code may be dedicated or allocated to the shared global cache. That is in the illustrated embodiment 2 GB of each core excluding the control plane core or core 1 may be used to form a 28 GB shared global cache. The configuration of the control plane such as via the configuration services may determine the amount of memory used for the shared global cache. In some embodiments each core may provide a different amount of memory for use by the global cache. In other embodiments any one core may not provide any memory or use the global cache. In some embodiments any of the cores may also have a local cache in memory not allocated to the global shared memory. Each of the cores may store any portion of network traffic to the global shared cache. Each of the cores may check the cache for any content to use in a request or response. Any of the cores may obtain content from the global shared cache to use in a data flow request or response.

The global cache can be any type and form of memory or storage element such as any memory or storage element described herein. In some embodiments the cores may have access to a predetermined amount of memory i.e. 32 GB or any other memory amount commensurate with the system . The global cache can be allocated from that predetermined amount of memory while the rest of the available memory can be allocated among the cores . In other embodiments each core can have a predetermined amount of memory. The global cache can comprise an amount of the memory allocated to each core . This memory amount can be measured in bytes or can be measured as a percentage of the memory allocated to each core . Thus the global cache can comprise 1 GB of memory from the memory associated with each core or can comprise 20 percent or one half of the memory associated with each core . In some embodiments only a portion of the cores provide memory to the global cache while in other embodiments the global cache can comprise memory not allocated to the cores .

Each core can use the global cache to store network traffic or cache data. In some embodiments the packet engines of the core use the global cache to cache and use data stored by the plurality of packet engines. For example the cache manager of and cache functionality of may use the global cache to share data for acceleration. For example each of the packet engines may store responses such as HTML data to the global cache. Any of the cache managers operating on a core may access the global cache to server caches responses to client requests.

In some embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store a port allocation table which can be used to determine data flow based in part on ports. In other embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store an address lookup table or any other table or list that can be used by the flow distributor to determine where to direct incoming and outgoing data packets. The cores can in some embodiments read from and write to cache while in other embodiments the cores can only read from or write to cache . The cores may use the global cache to perform core to core communications.

The global cache may be sectioned into individual memory sections where each section can be dedicated to a particular core . In one embodiment the control core A can receive a greater amount of available cache while the other cores can receiving varying amounts or access to the global cache .

In some embodiments the system can comprise a control core A. While illustrates core 1 A as the control core the control core can be any core within the appliance or multi core system. Further while only a single control core is depicted the system can comprise one or more control cores each having a level of control over the system. In some embodiments one or more control cores can each control a particular aspect of the system . For example one core can control deciding which distribution scheme to use while another core can determine the size of the global cache .

The control plane of the multi core system may be the designation and configuration of a core as the dedicated management core or as a master core. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of operation and functionality the plurality of cores in the multi core system. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of allocation and use of memory of the system among the plurality of cores in the multi core system including initialization and configuration of the same. In some embodiments the control plane includes the flow distributor for controlling the assignment of data flows to cores and the distribution of network packets to cores based on data flows. In some embodiments the control plane core runs a packet engine and in other embodiments the control plane core is dedicated to management and control of the other cores of the system.

The control core A can exercise a level of control over the other cores such as determining how much memory should be allocated to each core or determining which core should be assigned to handle a particular function or hardware software entity. The control core A in some embodiments can exercise control over those cores within the control plan . Thus there can exist processors outside of the control plane which are not controlled by the control core A. Determining the boundaries of the control plane can include maintaining by the control core A or agent executing within the system a list of those cores controlled by the control core A. The control core A can control any of the following initialization of a core determining when a core is unavailable re distributing load to other cores when one core fails determining which distribution scheme to implement determining which core should receive network traffic determining how much cache should be allocated to each core determining whether to assign a particular function or element to a particular core determining whether to permit cores to communicate with one another determining the size of the global cache and any other determination of a function configuration or operation of the cores within the system .

F. Systems and Methods for Using an Application State Distributed Replication Table in a Multi Core System

The systems and methods described below are directed towards using an application state distributed replication ASDR table in a multi core system . In some implementations an ASDR table can be referred to as a distributed hash table . In general overview the ASDR table may be used to track the use of and or maintain the persistency of resources across the plurality of cores in the multi core system . Each core may include a copy of the ASDR table or in other embodiments may have access to a single ASDR table . The ASDR table may be divided into a plurality of partitions. Each partition may be assigned to or owned by a different core . Each partition may be maintained by for example a packet processing engine or a resource manager not shown of the packet processing engine on the core that owns the partition. Each partition may be associated with one or more resources. If a core owns a partition the packet processing engine on the core may establish resources in the partition. If the core does not own the partition the core must request that the owner core establish the resources. The packet processing engine on the owner core establishes the resources in its partition on the ASDR table and sends the resource information to the requestor core . The packet processing engine on the requestor core caches the information in the partition assigned to the owner core on the table the requestor core maintains. Additionally the packet processing engine on the core may update the resources on the partition the core owns and the core may request and cache updates for resources in partitions assigned to other cores .

Referring now to a block diagram of an ASDR table comprising a plurality of partitions is depicted. The ASDR table sometimes referred to as a partition table may be shared by a plurality of cores on a multi core system . The one table may be in shared memory or each core may have a copy of the table such as table table through table N that it maintains. A table such as table for core 1 may include a plurality of partitions . Each partition in the table may be assigned to or owned by a different core . In this embodiment core 1 may own partition core 2 may own partition and so forth. Core 1 may create and store information for core 1 in partition . Core 1 may receive information for other cores and cache the information in the partitions corresponding to the cores . In one example core 1 may receive information for core 2 and cache it in partition . In another example core 1 may receive information for core N and cache it in partition . Likewise the table for core 2 may include a plurality of partitions and the partitions may be owned by different cores or store information for the cores in a similar manner as the partitions on table for core 1. Partition ownership and storage of information may be similarly executed for any table in the ASDR table.

A core may determine which core owns the information to be stored by using a hash of information for a request for a resource such as a hash of transport layer connection information. The hash may be used as an index into the ASDR table . For example in some embodiments any hash of information for a request may fall within a predetermined range of values. The predetermined range of values may be divided into a plurality of sub ranges according to the number of cores on the multi core system . As a result if a hash of information for a request falls within a first sub range of values the first core owns the resource for the request. If a hash of information falls within a second sub range of values the second core owns the resource for the request and so on. In various embodiments if a core owns the resource for the request the core may establish or update the resource in the partition assigned to the core . In additional embodiments if a core does not own the resource for the request the core may send a request to the owner core to establish or update the resource. The owner core may establish or update the resource in its partition and send resource information to the requestor core . The requestor core may cache the resource information in the partition assigned to the owner core on the table it maintains.

The information for a core may include for example any type and form of information related to a resource identified managed or established or otherwise owned by the core. For examples the resources established by the core may be stored in the partition assigned to the core . The information may include any information for tracking the resource such as an identifier and or name. The information may include any temporal information related to the resource such as time created and time last used. The information may include any information related to the status or state of the resource. The information may include any information related to transactions of the resource or history of use of the resource.

The resource managed via the ASDR table may include any resource identified managed or controlled by the multi core system or any portion thereof. In some embodiments the resource may include a session. In other embodiments the resource may include a connection to a service. In more embodiments the resource may include a monitor for a service. In various embodiments the resource may include a security certificate. In some embodiments the resource may be a cookie. In other embodiments the resource may be a server identifier. In some embodiments the resource may be a URL. In some embodiments the resource may be cached content. In some embodiments the resource may be a user. In other embodiments the resource may be any service functionality or operation provided by a packet engine.

Referring now to a flow diagram depicting steps of an embodiment of a method for maintaining resource persistency across a plurality of cores in a multi core system is shown and described. In brief overview the method includes receiving step by a core a request identifying a resource. The method also includes determining step the core that will store the resource. If the core that receives the request will store the resource the method also includes establishing or updating step the resource in the partition assigned to the core . If the core that receives the request will not store the resource the method also includes sending step a request to the owner core to establish or update the resource. The method also includes receiving step resource information from the owner core . The method also includes caching step the resource information in the partition assigned to the owner core .

The core may receive a request identifying a resource from a flow distributor . The flow distributor may distribute the request to the core according to any of the methods described with respect to . In some embodiments the packet processing engine on the core receives the request. In various embodiments the packet processing engine receives the request on a virtual server configured to provide resource persistency.

The multi core system may determine the core that stores the resource according to any type and form of algorithm or decision making. In some embodiments the packet processing engine may generate a hash of transport layer connection information of the request. The packet processing engine may determine the core that stores the resource based on the hash. For example if the hash falls with a first sub range of values described with respect to the packet processing engine may determine that the first core stores the resource. If the hash falls within a second sub range of values the packet processing engine may determine that the second core stores the resource and so forth. In some embodiments the packet processing engine may determine that the core corresponding to the packet processing engine stores the resource. In other embodiments the packet processing engine may determine that another core will store the resource. In various embodiments the packet processing engine may determine the core that stores the resource by accessing the partition assigned to the engine s core. In some embodiments the multi core system may use a lookup table not shown that stores the associations between the resources and the cores .

If the core that receives the request will also store the resource the packet processing engine on the core may establish or update a resource in the partition assigned to the core . The packet processing engine may access the partition to determine if the resource is already stored in the partition. If the resource is not yet stored the packet processing engine may establish the resource in the partition. If the resource is already being stored the packet processing engine may update the resource. In some embodiments upon updating the resource in the partition the packet processing engine may send messages with updated resource information to other cores that have previously cached information about the resource.

If the core that receives the request will not store the resource the packet processing engine of the core may send a request to the owner core to establish or update the resource. The core may examine the partition of its hash table associated with the owner core to determine if the resource is already being stored. If the resource is not being stored the packet processing engine of the core may send a request to the owner core to establish the resource. If the resource is being stored the packet processing engine of the core may send a request to the owner core to update the resource. Upon receiving resource information from the owner core the packet processing engine on the core may cache the resource information in its hash table in the partition assigned to the owner core.

Referring now to a flow diagram depicting steps of an embodiment of a method for maintaining session persistency across a plurality of cores in a multi core system wherein the session has been established in an ASDR table is shown and described. In brief overview the method includes receiving step by a packet processing engine on a core a request for a session. The method also includes determining step by the packet processing engine that a session already exists in the table . The method also includes determining step by the packet processing engine the state of the service associated with the session. If the state of the service is up the method also includes providing step by the packet processing engine the request to the virtual server associated with the service. If the state of the service if down the method also includes determining step by the packet processing engine the partition that will stores the session. If the partition assigned to the engine s core will store the session the method also includes load balancing updating the session and sending step a message to other cores including the information about the updated session. If the partition assigned to a different core will store the session the method also includes sending step a request to the owner core to update the session. The method also includes receiving step information associated with the updated session from the owner core. The method also includes caching step the information associated with the updated session in the partition assigned to the owner core.

As discussed in the previous section to overcome limitations on transistor spacing and CPU speed increases many CPU manufacturers have incorporated multi core CPUs to improve performance beyond that capable of even a single higher speed CPU. Similar or further performance gains may be made by operating a plurality of appliances either single or multi core together as a distributed or clustered appliance. Individual computing devices or appliances may be referred to as nodes of the cluster. A centralized management system may perform load balancing distribution configuration or other tasks to allow the nodes to operate in conjunction as a single computing system. Externally or to other devices including servers and clients in many embodiments the cluster may be viewed as a single virtual appliance or computing device albeit one with performance exceeding that of a typical individual appliance.

Referring now to illustrated is an embodiment of a computing device cluster or appliance cluster . A plurality of appliances or other computing devices sometimes referred to as nodes such as desktop computers servers rackmount servers blade servers or any other type and form of computing device may be joined into a single appliance cluster . Although referred to as an appliance cluster in many embodiments the cluster may operate as an application server network storage server backup service or any other type of computing device without limitation. In many embodiments the appliance cluster may be used to perform many of the functions of appliances WAN optimization devices network acceleration devices or other devices discussed above.

In some embodiments the appliance cluster may comprise a homogenous set of computing devices such as identical appliances blade servers within one or more chassis desktop or rackmount computing devices or other devices. In other embodiments the appliance cluster may comprise a heterogeneous or mixed set of devices including different models of appliances mixed appliances and servers or any other set of computing devices. This may allow for an appliance cluster to be expanded or upgraded over time with new models or devices for example.

In some embodiments each computing device or appliance of an appliance cluster may comprise a multi core appliance as discussed above. In many such embodiments the core management and flow distribution methods discussed above may be utilized by each individual appliance in addition to the node management and distribution methods discussed herein. This may be thought of as a two tier distributed system with one appliance comprising and distributing data to multiple nodes and each node comprising and distributing data for processing to multiple cores. Accordingly in such embodiments the node distribution system need not manage flow distribution to individual cores as that may be taken care of by a master or control core as discussed above.

In many embodiments an appliance cluster may be physically grouped such as a plurality of blade servers in a chassis or plurality of rackmount devices in a single rack but in other embodiments the appliance cluster may be distributed in a plurality of chassis plurality of racks plurality of rooms in a data center plurality of data centers or any other physical arrangement. Accordingly the appliance cluster may be considered a virtual appliance grouped via common configuration management and purpose rather than a physical group.

In some embodiments an appliance cluster may be connected to one or more networks . For example referring briefly back to in some embodiments an appliance may be deployed between a network joined to one or more clients and a network joined to one or more servers . An appliance cluster may be similarly deployed to operate as a single appliance. In many embodiments this may not require any network topology changes external to appliance cluster allowing for ease of installation and scalability from a single appliance scenario. In other embodiments an appliance cluster may be similarly deployed as shown in or discussed above. In still other embodiments an appliance cluster may comprise a plurality of virtual machines or processes executed by one or more servers. For example in one such embodiment a server farm may execute a plurality of virtual machines each virtual machine configured as an appliance and a plurality of the virtual machines acting in concert as an appliance cluster . In yet still other embodiments an appliance cluster may comprise a mix of appliances or virtual machines configured as appliances . In some embodiments appliance cluster may be geographically distributed with the plurality of appliances not co located. For example referring back to in one such embodiment a first appliance may be located at a first site such as a data center and a second appliance may be located at a second site such as a central office or corporate headquarters. In a further embodiment such geographically remote appliances may be joined by a dedicated network such as a T1 or T3 point to point connection a VPN or any other type and form of network. Accordingly although there may be additional communications latency compared to co located appliances there may be advantages in reliability in case of site power failures or communications outages scalability or other benefits. In some embodiments latency issues may be reduced through geographic or network based distribution of data flows. For example although configured as an appliance cluster communications from clients and servers at the corporate headquarters may be directed to the appliance deployed at the site load balancing may be weighted by location or similar steps can be taken to mitigate any latency.

Still referring to an appliance cluster may be connected to a network via a client data plane . In some embodiments client data plane may comprise a communication network such as a network carrying data between clients and appliance cluster . In some embodiments client data plane may comprise a switch hub router or other network devices bridging an external network and the plurality of appliances of the appliance cluster . For example in one such embodiment a router may be connected to an external network and connected to a network interface of each appliance . In some embodiments this router or switch may be referred to as an interface manager and may further be configured to distribute traffic evenly across the nodes in the application cluster . Thus in many embodiments the interface master may comprise a flow distributor external to appliance cluster . In other embodiments the interface master may comprise one of appliances . For example a first appliance may serve as the interface master receiving incoming traffic for the appliance cluster and distributing the traffic across each of appliances . In some embodiments return traffic may similarly flow from each of appliances via the first appliance serving as the interface master. In other embodiments return traffic from each of appliances may be transmitted directly to a network or via an external router switch or other device. In some embodiments appliances of the appliance cluster not serving as an interface master may be referred to as interface slaves A N.

The interface master may perform load balancing or traffic flow distribution in any of a variety of ways. For example in some embodiments the interface master may comprise a router performing equal cost multi path ECMP routing with next hops configured with appliances or nodes of the cluster. The interface master may use an open shortest path first OSPF In some embodiments the interface master may use a stateless hash based mechanism for traffic distribution such as hashes based on IP address or other packet information tuples as discussed above. Hash keys and or salt may be selected for even distribution across the nodes. In other embodiments the interface master may perform flow distribution via link aggregation LAG protocols or any other type and form of flow distribution load balancing and routing.

In some embodiments the appliance cluster may be connected to a network via a server data plane . Similar to client data plane server data plane may comprise a communication network such as a network carrying data between servers and appliance cluster . In some embodiments server data plane may comprise a switch hub router or other network devices bridging an external network and the plurality of appliances of the appliance cluster . For example in one such embodiment a router may be connected to an external network and connected to a network interface of each appliance . In many embodiments each appliance may comprise multiple network interfaces with a first network interface connected to client data plane and a second network interface connected to server data plane . This may provide additional security and prevent direct interface of client and server networks by having appliance cluster server as an intermediary device. In other embodiments client data plane and server data plane may be merged or combined. For example appliance cluster may be deployed as a non intermediary node on a network with clients and servers . As discussed above in many embodiments an interface master may be deployed on the server data plane for routing and distributing communications from the servers and network to each appliance of the appliance cluster. In many embodiments an interface master for client data plane and an interface master for server data plane may be similarly configured performing ECMP or LAG protocols as discussed above.

In some embodiments each appliance in appliance cluster may be connected via an internal communication network or back plane . Back plane may comprise a communication network for inter node or inter appliance control and configuration messages and for inter node forwarding of traffic. For example in one embodiment in which a first appliance communicates with a client via network and a second appliance communicates with a server via network communications between the client and server may flow from client to first appliance from first appliance to second appliance via back plane and from second appliance to server and vice versa. In other embodiments back plane may carry configuration messages such as interface pause or reset commands policy updates such as filtering or compression policies status messages such as buffer status throughput or error messages or any other type and form of inter node communication. In some embodiments RSS keys or hash keys may be shared by all nodes in the cluster and may be communicated via back plane . For example a first node or master node may select an RSS key such as at startup or boot and may distribute this key for use by other nodes. In some embodiments back plane may comprise a network between network interfaces of each appliance and may comprise a router switch or other network device not illustrated . Thus in some embodiments and as discussed above a router for client data plane may be deployed between appliance cluster and network a router for server data plane may be deployed between appliance cluster and network and a router for back plane may be deployed as part of appliance cluster . Each router may connect to a different network interface of each appliance . In other embodiments one or more planes may be combined or a router or switch may be split into multiple LANs or VLANs to connect to different interfaces of appliances and serve multiple routing functions simultaneously to reduce complexity or eliminate extra devices from the system.

In some embodiments a control plane not illustrated may communicate configuration and control traffic from an administrator or user to the appliance cluster . In some embodiments the control plane may be a fourth physical network while in other embodiments the control plane may comprise a VPN tunnel or communication via one of planes . Thus the control plane may in some embodiments be considered a virtual communication plane. In other embodiments an administrator may provide configuration and control through a separate interface such as a serial communication interface such as RS 232 a USB communication interface or any other type and form of communication. In some embodiments an appliance may comprise an interface for administration such as a front panel with buttons and a display a web server for configuration via network or back plane or any other type and form of interface.

In some embodiments as discussed above appliance cluster may include internal flow distribution. For example this may be done to allow nodes to join leave transparently to external devices. To prevent an external flow distributor from needing to be repeatedly reconfigured on such changes a node or appliance may act as an interface master or distributor for steering network packets to the correct node within the cluster . For example in some embodiments when a node leaves the cluster such as on failure reset or similar cases an external ECMP router may identify the change in nodes and may rehash all flows to redistribute traffic. This may result in dropping and resetting all connections. The same drop and reset may occur when the node rejoins. In some embodiments for reliability two appliances or nodes within appliance cluster may receive communications from external routers via connection mirroring.

In many embodiments flow distribution among nodes of appliance cluster may use any of the methods discussed above for flow distribution among cores of an appliance. For example in one embodiment a master appliance master node or interface master may compute a RSS hash such as a Toeplitz hash on incoming traffic and consult a preference list or distribution table for the hash. In many embodiments the flow distributor may provide the hash to the recipient appliance when forwarding the traffic. This may eliminate the need for the node to recompute the hash for flow distribution to a core. In many such embodiments the RSS key used for calculating hashes for distribution among the appliances may comprise the same key as that used for calculating hashes for distribution among the cores which may be referred to as a global RSS key allowing for reuse of the calculated hash. In some embodiments the hash may be computed with input tuples of transport layer headers including port numbers internet layer headers including IP addresses or any other packet header information. In some embodiments packet body information may be utilized for the hash. For example in one embodiment in which traffic of one protocol is encapsulated within traffic of another protocol such as lossy UDP traffic encapsulated via a lossless TCP header the flow distributor may calculate the hash based on the headers of the encapsulated protocol e.g. UDP headers rather than the encapsulating protocol e.g. TCP headers . Similarly in some embodiments in which packets are encapsulated and encrypted or compressed the flow distributor may calculate the hash based on the headers of the payload packet after decryption or decompression. In still other embodiments nodes may have internal IP addresses such as for configuration or administration purposes. Traffic to these IP addresses need not be hashed and distributed but rather may be forwarded to the node owning the destination address. For example an appliance may have a web server or other server running for configuration or administration purposes at an IP address of 1.2.3.4 and in some embodiments may register this address with the flow distributor as it s internal IP address. In other embodiments the flow distributor may assign internal IP addresses to each node within the appliance cluster . Traffic arriving from external clients or servers such as a workstation used by an administrator directed to the internal IP address of the appliance ... may be forwarded directly without requiring hashing.

The systems and methods of the present solution are directed towards using an ASDR table with a device cluster or appliance cluster . Each node within the appliance cluster can be a multi core system with a plurality of cores . As described above the ASDR table may be used to track the use of and or maintain the persistency of resources across the plurality of cores and nodes in a cluster . Each core and or node may include a copy of the ASDR table and in some embodiments may have access to a single ASDR table. In some embodiments the ASDR table can be made up of or separated into a plurality of partitions. In some embodiments specific nodes and then specific cores within the node may be responsible for certain partitions of the ASDR table. In any of the embodiments described herein the core owner of an entry within an owner node can be determined by hashing the key to a value. The value can then modded e.g. apply a mod operation by the number of cores in the node and may be assigned to the resulting core. For example if a key is hashed to the value of 100 and the owner node contains four cores the owner core of the hashed value may be core 0 because 100 mod 4 0.

In some embodiments the same ASDR table can be distributed over a plurality or cores and or a plurality of nodes and can act functionally the same to an application accessing the ASDR table such that common code can access ASDR table key value pairs also known as entries when the ASDR table is deployed on a multi core or multi node system.

An application can access an ASDR table through a number of callbacks. In some embodiments data stored in the ASDR table can be stored in a native format that can be unlike the format outside the ASDR table. Accordingly example callbacks can include functions that serialize and or deserialize the data coming into and out of the ASDR table e.g. the functions can convert data passing between the ASDR table and application into formats required by each . Callback functions can also include functions that create get and or update entries in the ASDR table. In some embodiments the functions can create get and or update just one of the key or value associated with an entry. Entries in the ASDR table can also be deleted with a function call. In some embodiments references e.g. pointers to entries in the ASDR table can be created increment and decrement by functions. The ASDR table functions can work on the request response model. In some embodiments transmit errors e.g. packet loss is handled by an application accessing the ASDR table and in other embodiments the transmit error is handled by the ASDR table.

In some embodiments the keys of the ASDR table can have an owner such as a specific core. The owner of the key can be determined by hashing the key. For a single node multi core system the key is hashed to a value and then a mod operation is performed on the value with the result equaling the core number that owns the key. In multi node multi core systems an owner node can first be selected and then the owner core within the owner node. The owner node can be determined by the same modding procedure described above for determining the owner core. In other embodiments a node chain is created such that a first key is given to the first node a second key is given to the second node and so on. In some embodiments the function that selects the owner node may also select to which nodes the key should be backed up also referred to as replicating an entry . Responsive to determining the owner node the owner core within the owner node can be determining using the modding procedure described above.

Referring again to entry replication in some embodiments the number or replicas i.e. backups can be 0 1 or a number greater than 1. For example a node may replicate its entries onto two non owner nodes. The replication of nodes can prevent the loss of key value pairs due to node failure or other system problems. An owner node may replicate an entry responsive to receiving and storing the entry or the owner node may pool the replication tasks and perform the replications at a specific time such as when background timer fires. If an owner node detects the failure of another node in the multi node system the owner node may determine if the failed node was a node storing a replica of the owner node s entries and then re replicate its entries onto a new node.

In some embodiments a node can request a copy of an entry from an owner node using a node to node or core to core messaging service. Responsive to receiving the message the node can cache the entry. In some embodiments the node storing the cache may check to determine if its cached copy of the entry is still accurate. In some embodiments owner nodes can age and then delete the entries they store if they are not used or accessed within a given time period e.g. two minutes . In such an embodiment a node storing a cached copy of an entry may inform the owner node that the node is using its local cached copy of an ASDR table entry such that the owner node does not delete the original copy of an entry while the non owner node is using its cached copy. This process can be referred to as contract renewal. The node storing the cached copy may search through its cached entries and send messages to the owner nodes of cached copies that it has recently used or accessed. These messages can be referred to as heartbeat messages. In some embodiments the core searches for cached entries for 1 ms every second. Responsive to receiving the message the owner node can reset the aging delete timer for the entry corresponding to the message it received. The message can include the key and or value of a used entry. In some embodiments the message includes the key value pair when the owner node needs to renew its own copy of the entry. For example the node may have temporally failed and may no longer have the latest value for the keys it owns.

When a node enters or leaves a multi node system for example due to node failure or system demands ownership of ASDR table entries may be reassigned. In a multi node system that is not replicating entries node failure can result in a new owner node or nodes being selected for the entries previously stored on the failed node. Entries stored on the failed node can be restored by the above described messaging process. For example a new owner node may be selected. The new owner node can then receive the heartbeat messages for the entries previously stored on the failed node. When new node receives the heartbeat message it can update its entries with the entry received in the heartbeat message. In a multi node system that replicates entries the system may need to determine if the failed node stored replica copies. If the failed node did contain replica copies lost replicas can be re replicated on to a new node.

As with node failure the addition of a node to the system can result in a change to ASDR table entry ownership. In some embodiments the new node can be populated with the entries through the above described heartbeat messaging system. The new node may passively wait for the heartbeats to be delivered or the new node may actively seek the entries form other nodes in the system that may contain a replica or cached copy of the entry. In some embodiments a node can transmit heartbeat messages responsive to a system timer. In these embodiments a new node may receive a copy of all the entries that it owns during one period of the system timer. In some embodiments if a new node receives a request for an key for which the new node has not yet received a heartbeat message the new node may forward the request to the old owner of the key as it may still maintain its copy of the key as a cached key copy.

In some embodiments updates to the ASDR table can fail. Update failure can be handled by the system in predetermined ways to minimize system disruption. In one example a request for an entry may fail to send. In this example the sender may immediately be notified of the failed send attempt. In another example the update to an ASDR table entry may fail. During a failure to update an entry the entry may maintain its original value and the node and or core from which the update request originated may be notified of the failure. In another example the update of an entry may succeed but the subsequent updating of a cached copy may fail. In this example a cached copy may temporally contain an incorrect ASDR table entry. In one embodiment the owner node may attempt to resend the cache update at a later time. In another embodiment the cached copy may be detected as via the above described heartbeat process. Responsive to the detection of an outdated cached copy the owner node may send a message to the maintainer of the cached copy to update its cached copy of the entry.

Requests for entries can be stateful or stateless. In a stateful example the key of an ASDR table entry can be marked a incomplete when a request for the key has been made. In a stateless example the details of the request can be included within the request for an entry and may not be marked with the ASDR table entry. The request details can then be returned to the requesting node when the request if fulfilled. In some embodiments the a request may arrive at a node that may not have the capacity to store a cache copy of an entry such as when the namespace associated with the ASDR table is full. In these embodiments the node may use stateful messages as the node may not be able to save a cached copy of the entry and mark it as incomplete. 

In some embodiments when a node enters and or leaves a cluster the above described cached information may become invalid. For example when a node becomes disabled the entries previously maintained by the node may be assigned to new owners. The new owner node may take ownership of the entry and update the entry without knowledge that a cached copy of the entry is stored on another node within the system. When the new owner node updates the entry the cached copies may become outdated and no longer reflect the updated entry. In some embodiments outdated caches may be marked as invalid. The process of invalidating an entry may be referred to as poisoning the entry.

The poisoning of an entry can include invalidating the entry e.g. setting the entry to an unusable value marking a poison flag associated with the entry and or purging e.g. deleting the entry from the ASDR table.

In some embodiments the poisoning of cached copies can be treated differently when the multi node system is employing replication and when the system is not employing replication. In one embodiment when replication is not employed the cached entries of entries owned by a failed node may all be poisoned. For example node D may request an entry from node A and upon receipt of the entry node D creates a cached copy of the entry. Node A may fail and the ownership of entry may be transferred to node B. Node B may not have knowledge of the cached entry on node D and may update entry . Responsive to the update of entry the cached copy of entry on node D may no longer be valid and should be poisoned.

In an embodiment employing replication a node may decide not to poison a cached entry. For example responsive to a node failure or other event that results in the departure of a node from a multi mode system a cached entry may not be poisoned if the node determines it is within the replication chain of the failed node. When within the replication chain of a failed node a cached entry may be maintained as a replica copy. Consider the example where node A replicates to node B and node B replicates to node C. In this example an entry may be maintained on node A replicated on node B and cached on node C. If node A fails node B may become the new owner of the entry which could then be replicated onto node C. Because node C is within the replication chain of node B the cached copy of node C may not be poisoned as it may be converted to a replica. Similarly in some embodiments a node may not poison its cached copy of an entry if the node determines that it is be the new owner of the entry responsive to a node failure.

In some embodiments the decision to poison an entry may reference an entry creation time. The entry creation time and owner node information may be stored for the entries of the ASDR table. In some embodiments referencing the creation time of an entry may be used to determine if entries maintained by a node are valid when a node quickly leaves and then returns to a multi node system. For example responsive to returning to a multi node system it may take a predetermined amount of time for a node to process through its entries and determine if its entries are valid. In some embodiments the system may reference the creation time table to determine if a node has had enough time to process and invalidate the entries it maintains. The creation times stored in the creation time table may be updated when entries are updated by a node.

In some embodiments when an application accesses an ASDR table entry and the returned value is invalid the application can mark a flag that the entry needs to be poisoned. In some embodiments the application may invalidate the entry such that it is unusable. The application may then make a request to the node to get a new copy of the ASDR table entry. In some embodiments the above process can be transparent to the client. For example a client may request an entry from a node. The node may check to determine if its cached entry is poisoned. Responsive to determining that the cached copy is poisoned the node can request a new copy of the entry from the owner before responding to the client.

At step the cluster determines a node left the cluster and then at step the nodes may search their cached entries to determine if any of the cached entries were copies of entries owned by the node that left the cluster.

At step the cached entries can be poisoned. In some embodiments a node may determine if it is within the replication chain of the node that failed node. Responsive to being within the replication chain the node may mark its cached copy as a replica and may not poison the copy. As described above in some embodiments the poisoning of an entry may include making a flag associated with the entry setting the entry to an usable value or purging the entry from the ASDR table.

At step an application attempting to access the poisoned entry may generate a request for a new ASDR table entry to replace the poisoned entry. In some embodiments the request to generate a new ASDR table entry can also include a request for a new owner for the entry. At step the application s request may be fulfilled by the new owner of the entry and the ASDR table entry can be updated with the new key value.

In some embodiments the multi node system may employ key versioning. Keys may be designed such that they can accommodate ASDR table growth. For example the keys of an ASDR table may be originally designed to include 4 bytes with 2 bytes reserved for future versions. In this example a first version may include a key that uses 2 of the 4 bytes for key storage. A second version may include a key that uses 3 of the 4 bytes for key storage. Versions may be divided into major and minor versions. A major version may be defined as a key version that is incompatible with other key versions. A minor version may refer to a change to a major version that may maintain compatibility with a major key version.

In some embodiments to ensure the nodes of the multi node system are compatible with one another when a new node enters a system it may request the current version number from the other nodes of the system. The new node may not work with the system if it determines that its version is not compatible with the other nodes of the system. In some embodiments an incompatible node may remove itself from a multi node system until its key version is upgraded to a version compatible with the other nodes of the system. In other embodiments a converter application can correct version mismatches.

In some embodiments the nodes of a multi node system may collaboratively determine which key version to use. For example the nodes of the system may send version messages to one another to determine which version is most common among the nodes of the system. The nodes may select to use the key version that the greatest percentage of the nodes can support. This initial quorum between the nodes may set the major version for the system. In some embodiments the version messages sent before a consensus of what key version to use can be referred to as non authoritative message and version messages sent to new nodes of the system once a decision is made regarding which key version to use can be referred to as authoritative messages.

In some embodiments a multi node system may upgrade its key version. As in some embodiments the owner node core can be determined responsive to the key a key version upgrade may result in changes to ASDR table entry ownership.

In some embodiments virtual IP addresses can be used by the nodes and cores of the multi node system for core to core and node to node messaging. A core or node s virtual IP addresses can be dynamically managed by the system or fixed. In some embodiments the virtual IP addresses are managed by a central authority such as the first node in a replication chain. In yet other embodiments the virtual IP addresses are managed on a predefined set of nodes.

In some embodiments when a message is sent to request entries from the ASDR table the key of the entry may not include a value. If a requested entry does not contain a value the requesting node may create the value and then invoke a PUT call to place the value into the owner node. In some embodiments as first node is creating the value for an ASDR table entry a second node may commit a value to the same entry of the ASDR table. In this example when the value created by the first node arrives at the owner node it may conflict with the value created by the second node. The owner node can send an error message to the first node and include the value from the second node in the message such that the first node can cache the value stored in the ASDR table.

In some embodiments an entry may become unusable. Responsive to becoming unusable the entry owner may update the entry. In some embodiments the owner node may not be available such that when an entry is unusable the requesting node may update the entry. In some embodiments multiple non owner nodes can request the entry update at relatively similar times and therefore the ASDR table may receive multiple updates to the entry within a quick succession. Responsive to receiving the first update to the entry the ASDR table may enter a refractory period where it may not update the entry for a predetermined amount of time. Nodes that attempt to update an entry during its refractory period may receive an error message. The error message can include the entry currently stored in the ASDR table that initiated the refractory period.

In some embodiments a messaging backlog can occur when a multi node system sends too many messages. The congestion to the system can be confined to a specific subset of the total number of nodes or the congestion can be experienced by all nodes in a system. In some embodiments the system can determine which nodes are congested with messages and refrain from delivering messages to those nodes. For example the system may not send any messages to a congested node for 10 second. In some embodiments create entry messages update entry messages or other system critical messages may still be sent to a congested node.

In some embodiments a node sending a request message can be responsible for ensuring the request is completed. For example if a receiving node is unable to respond to a message the sending node may resend the message. The sending node may resend a message if it does not receive a response to the message within a predetermined amount of time. A sending node may only attempt to send the message a predetermined number of times before not making another attempt to send the message.

When working with an ASDR table two primary data structures may be employed when sending a message. The first can be a transport data structure which can proceed the fields of the messages sent between the nodes and or the cores of the system. The second structure can represent the actual ASDR table entries.

When responding to a message the ASDR table can perform a number of functions. One example function can include error checking to ensure that ASDR table entry exists. Other ASDR table functions can include assembling a message applying special requirements to a message e.g. send the message to multiple nodes and sending a message.

The sending of messages within the multi node system can occur on two levels. As described above nodes may include a plurality of cores. In some embodiments a node or core may not be able to send a messages to a specific core on another node. In some embodiments communication between cores of different nodes can be accomplished by first sending the message from the sending node to the receiving node. The receiving node may then disseminate the message to the appropriate core by inter core messaging. In another embodiment a sending node may broadcast the messages to all the cores of the receiving node. The first core on the receiving node to receive the message can then forward the message to the proper core of the receiving node.
