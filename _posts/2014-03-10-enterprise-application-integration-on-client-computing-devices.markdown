These and other aspects and implementations are discussed in detail below. The foregoing information and the following detailed description include illustrative examples of various aspects and implementations and provide an overview or framework for understanding the nature and character of the claimed aspects and implementations. The drawings provide illustration and a further understanding of the various aspects and implementations and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification.

Following below are more detailed descriptions of various concepts related to and implementations of methods apparatuses and systems of providing information via a computer network. The various concepts introduced above and discussed in greater detail below may be implemented in any of numerous ways as the described concepts are not limited to any particular manner of implementation.

Customer Relationship Management CRM applications can manage interactions between a company and their customers over various contact channels such as email or instant messaging communications channels. Contact centers such as call centers can access or coordinate between multiple CRM applications. The CRM applications can evaluate the data collected via the various contact channels to create or provide information about customers. For example a contact center on behalf of a business entity can include or aggregate data from customer contacts via multiple channels to create a robust profile of clients. This data can be used for client relationship customer support marketing research or other purposes.

The contact center can include a number of agent or user workstations such as client computing devices connected to the internet or other communication network to communicate with customer computing devices for example via telephone voice over internet protocol short message service instant message or other mode of communication to manage data of various customers. For example an operator of a client computing device in a call center can receive a call from a customer via the client computing device and also retrieve other data about that customer based on previous interactions such as information about a pending customer order or service request e.g. during the call.

Different CRM applications that execute on one client computing device or execute on a server and display output on one client computing device may exchange data with each other in various ways. For example the CRM applications may be client server or web based applications so that the exchange of information between two or more CRM applications includes a server to server communication of the exchanged data between a server associated with the first CRM application and a server associated with a second CRM. A new user interface can be created on the client computing device to display the data received from the servers of the different CRM applications. This data can be provided for display by the client computing device via the internet or other computer network.

Systems and methods of the present disclosure relate generally to computer telephony integration of multiple CRM applications by a client computing device. The CRM applications can be different applications provided for example by different vendors. Different CRM applications can include different information about customers and can execute on or display output data on the client computing device.

To facilitate communication between different CRM applications on for example a single client computing device in a contact center environment the client computing device can be provided with a contact toolbar application. The contact toolbar application can execute on the client computing device to publish on the client computing device a connection point. Multiple CRM applications executing on or providing data to the client computing device can identify this connection point and can each establish a connection with the connection point. The connections establish an integration channel that connects on the client computing device the contact toolbar application with the CRM applications and connects the CRM applications with each other.

The integration channel provides a communication channel on the client computing device that integrates the contact toolbar or other computer telephony integration application with CRM or other enterprise applications and provides for client side communication between these applications on the client computing device to for example retrieve customer data about a customer while receiving or during a telephone call with that customer. In this example rather than server to server communication the contact toolbar and the CRM applications can communicate with each other via the integration channel for example to exchange real time events or data within the client computing device. This exchanged data can be retrieved by the contact toolbar from its corresponding server or can be retrieved by the CRM application from its corresponding server. However the exchange of data between the contact toolbar and the CRM application can occur on the client side via the integration channel and not via any server side communication channel between the respective servers. Thus the systems and methods described herein can provide a client based bi directional multi session event based communication protocol to allow intra client communication between CRM applications and the contact toolbar application via the integration channel.

The client computing devices can include computing devices to execute or communicate with CRM applications to access or provide computer telephony data integration with CRM applications for example as part of an enterprise application integration framework. The client computing devices can include desktop computers laptop computers tablet computers smartphones personal digital assistants thin client computing devices virtual computing devices mobile devices end user computing devices consumer computing devices clients and other computing devices. The client computing devices can include user interfaces such as microphones speakers touchscreens keyboards pointing devices a computer mouse touchpad or other input or output interfaces. The client computing devices can execute or display the results of CRM or other applications and can provide for the real time exchange of telephony integration data between CRM or other applications within the client computing device e.g. in the absence of a server to server exchange of the telephony integration data between servers associated with respective CRM or other applications.

The client computing device can include at least one user workstation . In some implementations the client computing device is the agent workstation however the user workstation can also include a virtual machine or virtual client device isolated from the remainder of the client computing device . The user workstation can include at least one processor e.g. of the client computing device to execute CRM or other applications. In some implementations an operator of the client computing device can logon to access the user workstation .

The user workstation can include at least one contact toolbar application and at least one CRM application . For example in a call center or other contact center environment the client computing device can execute the contact toolbar application to receive accept or manage a customer request such as a phone call. The contact toolbar application may include a script and can display telephone call or other data in an interface of the client computing device .

The contact toolbar application can execute to accept incoming customer communication requests via various communication channels. For example the client computing device can communicate with the networks such as the internet local area wide area satellite telephone or hybrid communication networks and the contact toolbar application can accept a phone call voice over internet protocol communication chat short message service instant message service email fax or other communication from a customer via those networks. The contact toolbar application can acquire contact or other identifying information of the customer such as a name username logon information or password for example. This information can be received from the customer during a call or can be retrieved from a database associated with the client computing device . In for example a contact center environment the contact toolbar application manages customer contact interaction. The contact toolbar application can indicate a call or message from a customer and allows for persistent bi directional communication with a customer from the client computing device .

In some implementations the contact toolbar application provides a display in a user interface of the client computing device . The operator of the client computing device can provide a username password or other details into the interface to logon to the contact toolbar application . For example in a call center environment the operator can logon to the contact toolbar application to obtain customer information such as a customer identification or customer interaction information such as historical data pertaining to that customer e.g. call history data . The contact toolbar application can execute on the client computing device to perform answer or hang up interactions to initiate or terminate a call with a customer and can include record pause resume or forward operations to control the communication with the customer. The contact toolbar application can allow the operator e.g. user to attach information to a record of the call such as notes of the call or other information about the customer. The contact toolbar application can include a script in an extensible format language or protocol designed to accommodate the addition of hooks application programming interfaces or plugins to allow the provide additional functionality such as the ability establish client side communication channels on the client computing device to communicate with at least one CRM application .

The CRM applications can include various customer relationship applications for managing a company s interactions with current future or potential customers. A business or other organization can use the CRM applications to organize automate synchronize or otherwise process data related to employees customers or potential customers of the organization. For example the CRM applications can be used to process employee or customer data related to sales marketing customer service or technical support. In some implementations the CRM applications are server side applications that for example are specialized for a market segment. Data from the CRM applications can be provided for display in a user interface of the client computing device via the internet or other network communication such as an intranet. The CRM applications can include e.g. in an associated database or access information about customer interactions and provide or make this data available to the contact toolbar application .

To enable for example direct client side communication between the contact toolbar application and at least one CRM application the contact toolbar application can include at least one master connector plugin . The master connector plugin can include a software component that can acts as an extension or add on of the contact toolbar application to facilitate client side asynchronous bi directional communication between the contact toolbar application and the CRM applications . For example the computer telephony data can be transmitted intermittently through these components rather than in a steady or continuous stream. The bi directional communication or integration between the contact toolbar application and the CRM applications can occur within the client computing device or within the user workstation for example in the absence of intervening servers in the communication path between the contact toolbar application and the CRM applications . The master connector plugin can include script or code such as C C Java or Java script.

The master connector plugin can execute on the client computing device e.g. within the contact toolbar application to publish at least one connection point such as an http endpoint or internet address. The connection point can provide or include a shared public channel on the client computing device published by the master connector plugin to allow client side connection and communication between the contact toolbar application and the CRM applications . The connection point can support http protocols or other application protocols. In one implementation the connection point can only be contacted by tools of the client computing device or the user workstation . For example other applications executing outside the workspace of the user workstation e.g. on computing devices other than the client computing device can be prohibited or blocked by the master connector plugin from accessing or connecting with the connection point . In some implementations communications via the connection point between components of the client computing device e.g. the contact toolbar application and the CRM applications occur directly e.g. on the client side or within the client computing device and without passing through an intermediary server.

The CRM applications can each include at least one connector plugin . The connector plugins can include software components that can act as extensions or add ons of the CRM applications to facilitate client side bi directional communication between the contact toolbar application and the CRM applications . The connector plugins can include script or code such as C C Java or Java script. In some implementations the connector plugin executes on within or as part of the CRM application to identify the connection point within the user workstation .

The connector plugin can detect the connection point and register the CRM application or the connector plugin with the connection point to establish a bi directional integration channel via the connection point between the contact toolbar application and the CRM application associated with the connector plugin . In some implementations multiple connector plugins of different CRM applications or different instances e.g. screens of the same CRM application on the client computing device can identify and register themselves with the same connection point . In this example the integration channel can provide for communication between the contact toolbar application and any CRM application registered with the connection point . The connector plugins can receive data or events from the master connector plugin via the integration channel and the connector plugins can execute custom actions with or for the corresponding CRM application . In this example the contact toolbar application can access data of the CRM applications via the integration channel e.g. directly and no via an intervening server such as a server associated with one of the CRM applications . In this example such a server does not communicate directly with the contact toolbar application via the internet or other communications or data network. In some implementations the master connector plugin receives an indication that the connector plugin has identified or registered with the connection point . In response the master connector plugin can generate the integration channel.

In some implementations for example in a call center environment the master connector plugin publishes an address on the client computing device of the connection point . The CRM applications can execute the connector plugins to identify and register their associated CRM applications with the connection point to establish the client side integration channel between the CRM applications and the contact toolbar application . When for example the contact toolbar application identifies an incoming call or other event the contact toolbar application can communicate with one or more of the CRM applications to for example obtain customer information from the CRM applications via a client side communication internal to the client computing device or between multiple client computing devices . For example a user can operate multiple computing devices from the contact center and the CRM application from one computer device can communicate with the contact tool via the integration channel for example using a local area network connection between the two computing devices .

Referring ahead illustrates an example environment for client application interaction to facilitate computer telephone integration on the user workstation e.g. of the client computing device . The contact toolbar application or component thereof such as the master connector plugin publishes the connection point within the user workstation . The CRM applications execute their respective connector plugins to identify and register to the connection point to establish the integration channel . The integration channel includes a communications channel for client side bidirectional communication between different CRM applications and the contact toolbar application . The communication between any of the CRM applications and the contact toolbar application via the integration channel can occur directly e.g. within the user workstation or the client computing device or without passing through an intervening server such as any of the CRM servers or the network such as the internet a local wide or other area network telephone voice or data network satellite network or combinations thereof.

In some implementations the integration channel establishes a loosely coupled distributed system between the CRM applications or between the contact toolbar application and the CRM applications . For example in the loosely coupled system one CRM application may not make use of the computer telephony integration data of another CRM application . In this example the CRM applications may send respective telephone integration data to the contact toolbar application independently so that data sent by one CRM application is not used by or relevant to data sent by another CRM application .

For example the CRM applications can each be associated with one or more corresponding CRM server . In some examples communication between CRM applications or between CRM applications and the contact toolbar application may be server based or server side communications. For example a first CRM application can communicate a request to its corresponding CRM server via the network . That CRM server can provide a response to the request via the network to another CRM server which then communicates a response to a second CRM application or to the contact toolbar application via the network where this integrated data may be displayed in a dedicated user interface of the user workstation . This server based computer telephony data integration can require load balancing between the CRM servers hindering scalability. Further the fault tolerance is low as the CRM servers in this server side architecture is a single point of failure architecture. In this server side or server to server based communication example the CRM applications for managing current and potential customers typically cannot directly communicate with each other via an intra client computing device communication to share data or business rules communicating instead such data in a server to server manner. In some implementations establishing the client side integration channel provides an alternative to this server based communication.

In some implementations rather than the above server side approach the integration channel is established on the client computing device e.g. the user workstation . By providing the connection point and using it to establish the integration channel on user workstation computer telephony data can be exchanged in real time e.g. during customer communication such as a phone call even if there is a pause or delay while data is retrieved via client side communication in the absence of the server to server communication of the above example. When providing computer telephony data via the integration channel data can be exchanged directly between CRM applications on the client computing device . In some implementations this exchange of data through the integration channel is not routed through the CRM servers and is not routed through the network .

In some implementations the integration channel is exclusively for use of the contact toolbar application and the CRM applications for the real time exchange of computer telephony integration data. For example the connection point can deny or refuse to register additional applications of the client computing device from accessing the integration channel despite an affirmative request received by the master connector plugin from the additional application requesting registration with the connection point or access to the integration channel .

In one example of integrated client side communication in a call center environment a first CRM application can send a command via the integration channel to the contact toolbar application such as a request to make a call. In response the contact toolbar application can send an event such as a dial event back to the first CRM application whereby the user workstation affects a telephone or voice over internet protocol call. A second CRM application can also send a different command such as a command via the integration channel to the toolbar application such as a request to ready a voice agent e.g. to alert a human operator of a forthcoming telephone or voice over internet protocol call. In response the contact toolbar application can send an event such as a ready agent event to the CRM application to alert an operator to prepare for a live call with for example a customer.

In some implementations the client computing device includes a graphical user interface to display a visualization of the contact toolbar application . The display for example can indicate various types of computer telephony integration data such as voice data instant messaging data short message service data chat data telephone network data voice over internet protocol data email data or work item data. The display in the user interface can indicate a session state of the contact toolbar application or the CRM application such as an active state a connected but inactive state or a disconnected state.

Referring to the environment can include a contact center environment such as a call center having a plurality of client computing devices . The client computing devices in the contact center environment can include at least one user workstation at least one contact toolbar application at least one CRM application at least one master connector plugin and at least one connector plugins . The contact toolbar application the CRM applications and their plugins or other components can provide computer telephony integration data for display in one or more user interfaces of the client computing device .

The contact toolbar application or component thereof such as the master connector plugin can generate or publish at least one connection point on the client computing device e.g. within the user workstation . The connection point can be used to establish the integration channel . For example the CRM applications can execute the connector plugin or other component to identify and establish a connection with the connection point . This can form the integration channel e.g. a communications channel for the exchange of computer telephone integration data between the contact toolbar application and the CRM applications within the client computing device . The computer telephony integration data can include data about customers employees or people connected to a call with the user of the client computing device . The telephony integration can include telephony data such as a phone number identify of a caller time details of a call location of a caller or telephone metadata as well as other information such as customer details from a database associated with the CRM applications that is not telephony data. The computer telephony integration data can be exchanged in real time between components of the user workstation . For example during a call with a customer through the client computing device the contact toolbar application can communicate with the CRM application to obtain telephony integration data via the integration channel .

The contact toolbar application can include a script. The script can be installed on or executed by the client computing device to transmit receive or obtain the computer telephony integration data via the integration channel directly e.g. via the CRM application and not via an intermediary server or computer network communication between the contact toolbar application and an intermediary server such as the CRM server . In some implementations the contact toolbar application can interact with one CRM application to exchange computer telephony integration data via the integration channel and can concurrently interact with another CRM application to exchange computer telephony integration data via the integration channel .

The concurrent interaction need not be simultaneous. For example during a time period e.g. of a phone call with a customer the computer telephone integration data can be sequentially transmitted via the integration channel to the contact toolbar application from multiple CRM applications . Transactions during this time period can be considered as real time or concurrent transactions as the contact toolbar application or the CRM applications can access or display the information during a time period when it is of use to an operator of the client computing device e.g. during a phone call with a customer .

The CRM applications and the contact toolbar application can provide a display in a graphical user interface of the client computing device . The display can indicate an active session state with the contact toolbar application via the integration channel a connected but inactive state with the contact toolbar application via the integration channel and a disconnected session state with the contact toolbar application via the interaction channel . The active session state can occur when the contact toolbar application and the CRM application are connected with the integration channel via the connection point and computer telephony data is being transmitted through the integration channel . The connected but inactive state can occur when the contact toolbar application and the CRM application are connected with the integration channel via the connection point but computer telephony data is not being transmitted through the integration channel . The inactive or disconnected session state can occur when the contact toolbar application and the CRM application is not connected with the integration channel via the connection point and computer telephony data is not being transmitted through the integration channel .

In some implementations the contact toolbar application executes within the user workstation to provide or transmit an activation event to the CRM application for example via the integration channel . The CRM application can receive the activation event and in response transmit a command via the integration channel to enter the active state. This may occur during a time period when a second CRM application is in a connective but inactive state with the contact toolbar application . The contact toolbar application can also receive a request command from the CRM application to establish a connection with the connection point and in response can provide a connect event to the CRM application to include the CRM application in the integration channel or to allow the CRM application to transmit and receive computer telephony data via the connection channel .

The client computing device or component thereof such as the contact toolbar application can execute a script to establish an active session between the contact toolbar application and the CRM application for the real time exchange of computer telephony integration data via the integration channel . The contact toolbar application or the CRM application can be displayed in a user interface of the client computing device and can indicate the session state e.g. active connected but inactive or disconnected . For example color coded circular display mimicking an LED can be displayed with green indicated an active state yellow indicating a connected but inactive state and red indicating a disconnected state of the associated component such as the CRM application .

The contact toolbar application can receive and send computer telephony integration data. For example the contact toolbar application can receive a command from one CRM application such as a request to make a call and in response can send an event to the CRM application to dial a number to establish the call. The contact toolbar application can receive and send multiple commands to multiple CRM applications .

In some implementations the contact toolbar application can receive a first connection request from a first CRM application and can receive a second connection request from a second CRM application . For example the CRM applications can request to register with the connection point and this request can be received by the master connector plugin . The contact toolbar application can establish via the integration channel a communication session between the CRM applications and the contact toolbar application . The contact toolbar application can provide computer telephony events e.g. data to the first CRM application and can provide the same or different computer telephony events e.g. data to the second CRM application via the integration channel during the communication session.

In some implementations the agent workstation or its components e.g. the master connector plugin or the connector plugin are middleware components or part of a software driver to enable the communication and management of computer telephony data in an enterprise application integration system. These components can be part of a software layer between the operating system of the client computing device and applications of a distributed computing system e.g. the CRM application . In some implementations the contact toolbar application and the CRM application also include middleware components.

The memory can include computer readable storage media and can store computer instructions such as processor executable instructions for implementing the operations described herein. The client computing device can include the memory to store computer telephone integration data customer or potential data employee data or marketing data for example. The processors can execute instructions stored in the memory and can read from or write to the memory information processed and or generated pursuant to execution of the instructions.

The processors can be communicatively coupled to or control the communications interfaces to transmit or receive information pursuant to execution of instructions. For example the communications interfaces can be coupled to a wired or wireless network bus or other communication means and can allow the computer system to transmit information to or receive information from other devices e.g. other computer systems . One or more communications interfaces can facilitate information flow between the components of the client computing device . In some implementations the communications interfaces can be configured e.g. via hardware components or software components to provide a website as an access portal to at least some aspects of the computer system . Examples of communications interfaces include user interfaces.
