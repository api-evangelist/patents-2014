title: Prescribing a software architecture for implementing service integration
abstract: An approach is provided for prescribing a software architecture to implement service integration. To determine first and second products, a first weight of a first software architecture is multiplied by weights of first requirements of a service and a second weight of a second software architecture is multiplied by weights of second requirements of the service. The first and second requirements are satisfied, respectively, by first and second sets of responses respectively associated with the first and second software architectures. A first summation of the first products is determined to be greater than a second summation of the second products. Based on the first summation being greater than the second summation, the first software architecture instead of the second software architecture is prescribed to realize the service in a service integration implementation. A work effort required to utilize the first software architecture to realize the service is estimated.

This application is a continuation application claiming priority to Ser. No. 13 609 333 filed Sep. 11 2012 which is a continuation application claiming priority to Ser. No. 11 935 679 filed Nov. 6 2007 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 316 346 issued Nov. 20 2012.

The present invention relates to a computer implemented method and system for selecting a software architecture to implement service integration and more particularly to a technique for prescribing a data exchange protocol to implement service oriented integration based on selected characteristics of functional and non functional requirements.

Conventionally selections of software architecture to implement the integration of services in a computing system are subjective and based on the personal experience of each individual making software architecture recommendations. These individual experience driven recommendations lead to inconsistent unreliable non scalable software architecture recommendations that are indefensible to clients who request the integrated services. Because of the inconsistent nature of the aforementioned recommendations selecting certain recommended software architectures results in unnecessarily expensive implementations of service integration. Thus there exists a need to overcome at least one of the preceding deficiencies and limitations of the related art.

The present invention provides a computer implemented method of selecting a technology to implement an integration of a plurality of services comprising 

receiving by a computing system a set of requirements for a service of the plurality of services wherein the set of requirements includes a plurality of functional requirements and a plurality of non functional requirements 

receiving by the computing system a plurality of technology preference relative weights for relatively weighting a plurality of technologies 

receiving by the computing system a plurality of requirement relative weights for relatively weighting the set of requirements 

receiving by the computing system a plurality of responses wherein the responses are associated with the requirements and with the requirement relative weights in a one to one correspondence wherein the responses are associated with the technology preference relative weights and with indicators of a set of indicators in a many to one correspondence wherein the set of n indicators indicates the plurality of technologies and wherein the plurality of responses indicates a plurality of characteristics that satisfy the set of requirements and

selecting by the computing system a technology of the plurality of technologies to implement the integration of the plurality of services wherein the selecting the technology is based on the plurality of technology preference relative weights and the plurality of requirement relative weights.

A system computer program product and a process for supporting computing infrastructure that provides at least one support service corresponding to the above summarized method are also described and claimed herein.

Advantageously the present invention provides a systematic rational and defensible technique for selecting a technology to implement service integration. Further the present invention optimizes the design time related to building a service by significantly decreasing subjectivity in selecting the technology to be used for service integration.

The present invention provides a technique that employs weighted metrics together with a simplified integration architecture of functional requirements and non functional requirements to provide a precise and defensible prescription of a technology for implementing service integration. The weighted metrics are employed in a technology selection algorithm that weights responses that select characteristics associated with the functional and non functional requirements. The weighting performed by the technology selection algorithm utilizes a first set of weights applied to the requirements and a second set of weights applied to each potential technology choice.

As used herein a service is defined as a business software component having functionality that has the following properties 1 publicly available 2 networked 3 has a well defined contract 4 stateless and 5 loosely bound. The aforementioned networked property indicates that the service can be invoked i.e. requested from remote computing systems. The aforementioned well defined contract includes a description of i how the service is invoked by a requester in an invocation ii the parameters required in the invocation and iii the results of the invocation. The aforementioned stateless property indicates that the service does not remember the last time a computing entity invokes the service. Further a request for the service is followed by a response. The aforementioned loosely bound property indicates that the service does not require knowledge of the identity or location of the requester that is invoking the service.

Services are invoked through data exchange protocols i.e. communication protocols that provide location transparency and interoperability. A data exchange protocol is provided by a software interface hereinafter referred to as an interface . Although the novel system and method disclosed herein describe the prescription of a technology for realizing a service the present invention also contemplates an analogous system and method for prescribing a technology for realizing an interface that provides the data exchange protocol by which the services are invoked.

Further if inquiry step determines that there is a functional requirement that is left to be analyzed i.e. there is a non analyzed functional requirement i.e. the Yes branch of step then in step service integration realization system see analyzes the response that is received in step see and that is associated with the non analyzed functional requirement.

If the analysis by service integration realization system see in inquiry step determines that the response being analyzed is included within a pre defined range of qualitative and or quantitative responses then in step service integration realization system see determines a weighted response value that is associated with 1 the response that is analyzed in step and 2 the functional or non functional requirement associated with the response that is analyzed in step .

In step service integration realization system see identifies the technology associated with the maximum determined in step and prescribes the identified technology as the technology to be utilized to realize the service. In step service integration realization system see displays output report see that includes the prescribed technology and includes rationale that supports the prescription of the technology. The technology selection algorithm ends at step .

The response received in step see is a numeral that 1 indicates a characteristic included in the set of characteristics 2 matches one of the numeric indicators in the headings of columns described above and 3 is included in column in the row that includes the set of characteristics. The characteristic indicated by the numeral is a response to the associated question. The associated question is in column see and is in the row that includes the set of characteristics.

For example the first row of data in indicates that functional requirement FR01 is associated with a Frequency criterion and the question associated with the Frequency criterion is How frequently will this service be accessed Considerations for a user who is responding to the question How frequently will this service be accessed are stated as Some services are not frequently accessed since their function or information does not change very often or is needed only occasionally e.g. sales forecast . 

After reviewing six characteristics displayed in step see i.e. the entries in columns in that correspond FR01 a user provides a response of 2 which is received in step see . The received response of 2 is shown in the first data entry of column of . The response of 2 indicates the JMS Broker technology which is also listed in the first data entry of column . The association between the numeral and the JMS Broker technology is also shown in the heading of column of . Because of the aforementioned association between the response of 2 and column of the response of 2 also indicates the characteristic in the data entry of column that corresponds to FR01. That is the response of 2 indicates that Several times an hour or minute in the first data entry in column see is the response to the aforementioned question How frequently will this service be accessed 

Each criterion a.k.a. service requirement in criteria is uniquely associated with an identified non functional requirement. Each criterion in criteria is satisfied by a characteristic that is indicated by a response received in step see . Each question in questions is uniquely associated with a criterion in criteria and a response that is provided for the question indicates the characteristics that satisfy the associated criterion. Each consideration in considerations is uniquely associated with a question included in questions and is a statement that is considered by the user s who provide the response to the associated question. Identifiers criteria questions and considerations are initially received by service integration realization system see in step see . Each criteria weight in criteria weights is a relative weight of an identified non functional requirement where the relative weight is received in step of .

The heading of each column includes a technology included in the pre defined list of technologies and a numeric indicator that uniquely identifies the technology and a characteristic in each set of characteristics as described below. Below the heading of each of the columns are characteristics associated with criteria see column of that is associated with the identified non functional requirements where the characteristics are initially received in step see are displayed in step see and are associated with the numeric indicator in the column heading.

Each set of characteristics along a row in report excerpt include the characteristics that can satisfy the associated criterion see column of via a response received in step see . The response received in step see is a numeral that 1 indicates a characteristic included in the set of characteristics 2 matches one of the numeric indicators in the headings of columns described above and 3 is included in column in the row that includes the set of characteristics. The characteristic indicated by the numeral is a response to the associated question. The associated question is in column see and is in the row that includes the set of characteristics.

For example the first row of data in indicate that non functional requirement NFR01 is associated with a Payload Size criterion and the question associated with the Payload Size criterion is What is the transaction payload size . Considerations for a user who is responding to the question What is the transaction payload size are stated as The size of each payload has an impact on the technology used. Some payloads need to accommodate multiple transactions while others can be on an individual transaction level. 

After reviewing six characteristics displayed in step see i.e. the entries in columns in that correspond to NFR01 a user provides a response of 2 which is received in step see . The received response of 2 is shown in the first data entry of column of . The response of 2 indicates the JMS Broker technology which is also listed in the first data entry of column . The association between the numeral and the JMS Broker technology is also shown in the heading of column of . Because of the aforementioned association between the response of 2 and column of the response of 2 also indicates the characteristic in the data entry of column that corresponds to NFR01. That is the response of 2 indicates that Large payload capability. Optimized for 2 4 K. Practical upper limit is several MB rqs is the response to the aforementioned question What is the transaction payload size 

The entries that are listed in the last row of report excerpt indicate the technologies in the pre defined list of technologies and are the same as the column headings in columns of and columns of .

The Yes Y and No N indicators of the Technology Adoption Preference row of report excerpt are received by service integration realization system see in step of . The Y indicators indicate the technologies that are preferred for realizing the service and the N indicators indicate the technologies that are not preferred for realizing the service. For example a client e.g. company who is requesting the service prefers using SOAP HTTP to realize the service because the client already has trained personnel to support such a technology choice. An indication of the client s SOAP HTTP preference is received by service integration realization system see . Furthermore system see includes a Y indicator in the Technology Adoption Preference row of excerpt where the Y indicator corresponds to the SOAP HTTP technology listed in the last row of excerpt .

Continuing the same example the client prefers not to use the Socket technology to realize the service because the client lacks trained personnel to support such a technology choice. Therefore system see receives an indication of the client s non preference for the Socket technology and includes an N indicator in the Technology Adoption Preference row of excerpt so that the N indicator corresponds to the Socket technology. For each technology for which the technology adoption preference is indicated as Yes a client e.g. company provides relative weights i.e. the technology preference relative weights that add up to 100 . The provided technology preference relative weights are received by service integration realization system see in step see and are included as the percentages in the row labeled Technology Preference Relative Weight in report excerpt .

Each percentage in the Responses by Criteria row of report excerpt is calculated to indicate the percentage of responses that correspond to the associated technology in the last row of report excerpt . For example the 34 and 43 values in the Responses by Criteria row indicate that 34 of the responses for the identified requirements i.e. identified functional and identified non functional requirements indicate the SOAP HTTP technology while 43 of the responses indicate the JMS Broker technology. The Responses by Criteria percentages are updated dynamically as additional responses are provided and will add up to 100 when valid responses for all identified requirements have been provided. In the example shown in report excerpt the Responses by Criteria percentages do not add up to 100 because valid responses for all identified requirements have not yet been provided.

The values in the Accumulated Weighted Response Values row of report excerpt are the accumulated weighted response values updated in step see . In step of 14 is determined to be the maximum accumulated weighted response value in excerpt . In step the SOAP HTTP technology in excerpt is prescribed for realizing the service because the 14 maximum value determined in step is associated with the SOAP HTTP technology in the last row of excerpt . The prescribed technology of SOAP HTTP is also included in the Prescribed Technology row of excerpt .

It should be noted that because of the weightings used in the equations described above relative to the technology associated with the highest Responses by Criteria percentage is not necessarily the same as the prescribed technology. As one example even though JMS Broker is the technology corresponding to the maximum value in the Responses by Criteria row of excerpt the prescribed technology is a different technology i.e. SOAP HTTP .
