title: Methods and apparatus for synchronizing closed heterogenous systems
abstract: Methods, systems, and computer program products for synchronizing a first closed system with a second closed system are disclosed. A first transaction synchronization function on a first computing device receives a first plurality of user transactions and stores corresponding transaction records in a first synchronization file in a common format. The first transaction synchronization function submits the first plurality of user transactions to the first closed system via a first vendor interface for application to a first database. A second computing device accesses the first synchronization file, translates the transaction records in accordance with a second vendor interface, and submits the translated transaction records to a second closed system via a second vendor interface for application to a second closed system.
