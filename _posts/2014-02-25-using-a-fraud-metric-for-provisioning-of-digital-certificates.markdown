title: Using a fraud metric for provisioning of digital certificates
abstract: A method for provisioning digital certificates in a multi-tenant network environment may include receiving an API request for a digital certificate from a representative of a customer entity. Existing account information of the representative may be retrieved, the existing account information associated with at least one service provided within the multi-tenant network environment and used by the representative. The identity of the representative may be verified based at least in part on digital certificate authentication information within the API request. At least one fraud metric may be generated for the representative based on the retrieved existing account information. The at least one fraud metric may be indicative of fraudulent activity associated with the representative. The identity verification and the at least one fraud metric may be used to determine whether to issue the digital certificate to the customer entity.

Cloud computing is the use of computing resources hardware and software that are available in a remote location and accessible over a network such as the Internet. In a computing environment with many computing devices such as a virtual server or cloud computing environment with many server computers the use of computing resources can provide a number of advantages including cost advantages and or the ability to adapt rapidly to changing computing resource needs. Additionally secure communications in the cloud computing environment are an important consideration as they ensure authentication of the communicating parties as well as integrity and security of the communication itself. However the setup of secure communications can be a difficult task for the communicating parties in the cloud computing environment.

For example entity authentication within the cloud computing environment may be based on digital certificates which may have to be issued to multiple parties. The digital certificates are typically issued by a Certificate Authority CA in exchange for a fee and after the CA has completed an extensive and time consuming authentication process. Once issued the digital certificates can be used without any additional interaction with or authentication by the CA which in the case of extended validation certificates can be a long period of time. Therefore not only is the process of obtaining digital certificates time consuming but issuing certificates for an extended period of time may lead to unauthorized use of the certificates causing security breaches in the cloud computing environment.

A virtual machine image contains an operating system e.g. Linux and other data needed to launch a virtual machine in a virtual environment. The virtual machine image is similar to a physical computer s disk volume and may include a file system the operating system and other components needed to boot up as a machine. In order to launch a virtual machine hardware needs to be selected. The hardware selection may be accomplished through instance types which may allow a variety of different sizes of memory CPU capacity I O performance and so forth. The combination of the virtual machine image and the instance type can be used to create an instance or a virtual machine which may be launched on a cloud computing resource such as a host server computer in a multi tenant network environment.

The following description is directed to techniques and solutions supporting using a fraud metric for provisioning of digital certificates in a network environment such as a cloud computing multi tenant network environment. A customer entity may request a digital certificate by communicating a Certificate Signing Request CSR to a Certificate Authority CA . The CA may perform identity and other verification of the requesting customer entity and or a customer entity representative submitting the CSR and information the customer entity is seeking to assert and get authorized by the CA e.g. the domain name of the customer entity identity of an officer of the customer entity requesting the certificate customer entity address authenticity of a public key of an asymmetric public private key pair of the customer entity and so forth . In this regard the CA may require proof of ownership of the domain and identity of the domain owner e.g. the customer entity as well as the identity of the corporate officer or employee representative requesting the certificate.

The CA authentication process may also be supplemented by a fraud detection service when making a decision on whether or not to issue a certificate to a customer entity in the multi tenant network environment. More specifically after the identity of the customer entity and or the representative is verified a fraud metric or score may be determined for the customer entity and or a representative of the customer entity requesting the certificate . The determination of the fraud metric may be based on existing account information associated with the customer entity and or the representative in connection with one or more services offered within the in the multi tenant network environment and used by the customer entity and or the representative . In some instances the fraud metric may be indicative of prior fraud or a possibility of future fraud in connection with usage of the one or more services by the customer entity and or the representative of the customer entity .

Once the CA has completed the authentication process and the fraud metric is determined to be within an acceptable range the CA may issue a digital certificate associating the requesting customer entity with the public key and the requested domain. The digital certificate is also cryptographically signed by the issuing CA e.g. using a private key of the CA and can be traced through a hierarchy of CAs to a CA that is known and trusted. Typically a digital certificate has an expiration date at which point the customer entity may need to apply again and pay a fee for reissuing the certificate. After issuance the digital certificate can be used in the cloud computing multi tenant network environment as well as other Internet based communications to establish the identity of the customer entity and or authenticity of one or more web sites or other network resources or services associated with the customer entity. Flexibility and reliability of digital certificate issuance and management may be improved by for example implementing the CA as well as the identity verification and fraud detection service as part of the multi tenant network environment.

As used herein the term provisioning a digital certificate means enabling and providing a digital certificate related service to a customer which may include authorizing the customer to have a digital certificate verifying customer s identity verifying the identity of a representative of the customer applying for a digital certificate issuing the digital certificate to the customer and or managing the digital certificate after issuance e.g. renewing reissuing and or revoking the digital certificate .

The CA may comprise suitable circuitry logic and or code and may be implemented as part of the digital certificate service within the compute service provider to handle the issuance and management e.g. reissuance and or revocation of digital certificates. Even though the CA is implemented as part of the computer service provider in other implementations the CSP may use the services of a CA that is implemented separately from the CSP .

The identity verification service may comprise suitable logic circuitry interfaces and or code and may be operable to provide one or more identity verification confirmations e.g. in connection with issuance of digital certificates by the CA . For example the identity verification service may be operable to verify the corporate identity of the customer entity e.g. customer entity is registered at the corporate address provided with the digital certificate application the customer entity is the registered legal owner of the domain name the digital certificate will be for and so forth .

The fraud detection service may comprise suitable logic circuitry interfaces and or code and may be operable to generate one or more fraud metrics e.g. in connection with issuance of digital certificates by the CA . For example the fraud detection service may use information provided in connection with a Certificate Signing Request existing account information B for the CE and or the CR and or other fraud related information A to assess fraud related risks associated with the CE and or the CR . As a result the fraud detection service may generate the fraud metric which may be used by the CA for denying or approving the issuance of the requested digital certificate.

In operation the customer entity e.g. CR may use an application programming interface API to send CSR information to the digital certificate service within the CSP . The CSR information may comprise a public key corresponding to the private key retained by CE domain name to be associated with the requested digital certificate and CR information and or CE information . The CR information may include information associated with the customer representative such as account login information for logging in and accessing one or more service offered by the CSP user email information user name and so forth. The CE information may include information associated with the customer entity such as corporate name address and so forth.

After the CSR information is communicated to the digital certificate service the identity verification service may use the CSR information to perform identity verification and validation in connection with the requested digital certificate. For example the identity verification may include bottom end validation by obtaining the registered email address for the requested domain and communicating a validation email request to the registered email address. The CE will be considered validated upon receipt of an email response to the validation email. The identity verification may also include organizational validation which may be performed by not only validating the email of record but also validating that the corporate entity registered for the requested domain name is the same entity as the requesting CE .

The identity verification service may further perform extended validation by establish the legal identity as well as the operational and physical presence of the website owner for the requested domain by establishing that the applicant e.g. the CE and or the CR is the domain name owner or has exclusive control over the domain name and or by confirming the identity and authority of the representative e.g. CR acting for the website owner e.g. CE and that documents pertaining to legal obligations are signed by an authorized officer of the CE . Upon completion of the identity verification an identity verification confirmation may be communicated to the CA .

The fraud detection service may use information provided in connection with a Certificate Signing Request existing account information B for the CE and or the CR and or other fraud related information A to assess fraud related risks associated with the CE and or the CR . As a result the fraud detection service may generate the fraud metric which may indicative of fraud related activities associated with the CE and or the CR . The fraud metric may be communicated to the CA and may be used by the CA together with the identity verification confirmation to deny or approve the issuance of the requested digital certificate. For example if the identity verification confirmation indicates a confirmed identity for the CE and or the CR and the fraud metric is below a threshold value then the CA may generate the certificate associated with the key and the domain name . After the certificate is generated it may be stored within a network resource that is being used by the customer entity communicated to the customer entity and or it may be stored within the certificate store .

The fraud detection service may also use existing CR CE account information B associated with one or more services offered by the CSP . The existing account information B may include historic account information e.g. associated with prior transactions of the CE or the CR in relation to one or more services that have been previously or currently used by the CE or the CR . The existing account information B may comprise for example customer behavior information location based information and other account information .

The fraud detection service may also use a third party verification service which may provide additional information for fraud assessment risk. Such information may include for example a credit card black list which may list currently revoked stolen unauthorized credit cards.

Even though only a limited number of fraud related information categories are listed in the disclosure is not limited in this regard and other types of information may also be used for assessing fraud associated with the CE and or the CR . The fraud detection service may consider one or more of the types of information discussed above and may assign for example weight values to each information considered so as to calculate a total fraud metric associated with the CE and or the CR for purposes of allowing or denying the issuance of the requested digital certificate.

The CR requests the digital certificate for a customer entity e.g. domain which may be www.CustomerXYZ.com. The CR information associated with the CSR information may include the email of the CR which may be john CustomerXYZ.com. The fraud detection service may assign a lower weight value to the fraud metric since the domain matches the CR s email domain. Additionally john CustomerXYZ.com may also have an established account with the CSP for purposes of for example retail purchases e.g. CSP provides online retail merchandizing services . The fraud detection service may locate CR s account based on CR s email john CustomerXYZ.com and may access historic account information. For example the fraud detection service may determine that the credit card issue country and the shipping address match the CE s country and address of record associated with the domain registration for the requested domain . Overall a very low fraud metric may be assigned and issuance of the certificate to the requesting CR may be approved.

The CR requests the digital certificate for a customer entity e.g. domain which may be www.CustomerXYZ.com. The CR information associated with the CSR information may include the email of the CR which may be john CustomerXYZ.com. The fraud detection service may assign a lower weight value to the fraud metric since the domain matches the CR s email domain. Additionally john CustomerXYZ.com may also have an established account with the CSP for purposes of for example retail purchases e.g. CSP provides online retail merchandizing services . The fraud detection service may locate CR s account based on CR s email john CustomerXYZ.com and may access historic account information. For example the fraud detection service may determine that CR s account is newly established e.g. information and has multiple purchases with a pre paid credit card information . The fraud detection service may then assign a higher fraud metric and issuance of the certificate to the requesting CR may be denied.

An action may indicate that the CR has logged in to a service provided by the CSP . For example the CR may log in to a cloud storage service provided by the CSP . Action may indicate that the CSP has received the login information e.g. CR information and or CE information which may include user name and password to access the cloud storage service of the CSP .

An action may comprise requesting by the customer entity or the CR a digital certificate. In this regard the CE or the CR may use an API request to communicate CSR information such as the domain and the public key which will be associated with the certificate. At the CSP may receive the CSR information and the digital certificate service may retrieve the public key and the domain . Additionally the digital certificate service may also retrieve the CR information and or the CE information which may be used by the fraud detection service for generating the fraud metric .

At the identity verification service within the digital certificate service may perform for example an extended validation and authenticate the identity of the CE and or the CR . The identity verification service may perform an extended validation by establishing the legal identity as well as the operational and physical presence of the website owner for the requested domain by establishing that the applicant e.g. the CE and or the CR is the domain name owner or has exclusive control over the domain name and or by confirming the identity and authority of the representative e.g. CR acting for the website owner e.g. CE and that documents pertaining to legal obligations are signed by an authorized officer of the CE .

At upon completing the extended validation and generating an identity verification confirmation by the identity verification service the fraud detection service may retrieve existing historic account information e.g. B and as illustrated in of the CE and or the CR in connection with a service offered by the CSP and previously used by the CE and or the CR e.g. the cloud storage service used by the CR . At the fraud detection service may generate the fraud metric based on the historic account information e.g. as explained above in reference to .

If the fraud metric is greater than or equal to a threshold value then at the CE and or the CR may receive a notification of denial of issuance of the requested digital certificate. If the fraud metric is less than the threshold value then at the CA may use the CSR information including the generated private public key pair to generate a digital certificate e.g. certificate for use by the customer entity and or the CR in connection with the domain . The digital certificate may be issued for a short fixed duration and may additionally identify the domain it will be used for or a specific network resource being used controlled and or paid for by the customer or another network resource that the customer needs certificate for . The generated certificate may be additionally signed by the CA e.g. by a private key of the CA to further authenticate the certificate.

At the issued digital certificate e.g. may be returned to the customer entity and or the CR and may be stored e.g. at a local certificate store managed by the customer entity .

In an example embodiment the compute service provider can be established for an organization by or on behalf of the organization. That is the compute service provider may offer a private cloud environment. In another embodiment the compute service provider supports a multi tenant environment wherein a plurality of customers operate independently i.e. a public cloud environment . Generally speaking the compute service provider can provide the following models Infrastructure as a Service IaaS Platform as a Service PaaS and or Software as a Service SaaS . Other models can be provided. For the IaaS model the compute service provider can offer computers as physical or virtual machines and other resources. The virtual machines can be run as guests by a hypervisor as described further below. The PaaS model delivers a computing platform that can include an operating system programming language execution environment database and web server. Application developers can develop and run their software solutions on the compute service provider platform without the cost of buying and managing the underlying hardware and software. The SaaS model allows installation and operation of application software in the compute service provider. In some embodiments end users access the compute service provider using networked customer devices such as desktop computers laptops tablets smartphones etc. running web browsers or other lightweight customer applications. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the compute service provider can be described as a cloud environment.

The particular illustrated compute service provider includes a plurality of server computers A D. While only four server computers are shown any number can be used and large centers can include thousands of server computers. The server computers A D can provide computing resources for executing software instances A D. In one embodiment the instances A D are virtual machines. As known in the art a virtual machine is an instance of a software implementation of a machine i.e. a computer that executes applications like a physical machine. In the example each of the server computers A D can be configured to execute a hypervisor or another type of program configured to enable the execution of multiple instances on a single server. For example each of the servers A D can be configured e.g. via the hypervisor to support one or more virtual machine partitions with each virtual machine partition capable of running a virtual machine instance e.g. server computer A could be configured to support three virtual machine partitions each running a corresponding virtual machine instance . Additionally each of the instances can be configured to execute one or more applications.

In an example embodiment each of the server computers A D may also comprise a digital certificate store A D communicatively coupled to the network . The digital certificate store may comprise suitable circuitry logic and or code and may be operable to store one or more digital certificates that have been issued in connection with at least one instance running on a corresponding server computer .

The compute service provider may also comprise a digital certificate service . The digital certificate service may comprise suitable circuitry logic and or code and may be operable to perform the functionalities described herein e.g. in reference to including identity verification validation and fraud detection in connection with issuing digital certificates as well as issue renew and or revoke digital certificates in connection with one or more of the network resources e.g. instances and or other services associated with the server computers of the provider . In this regard the digital certificate service may implement one or more of the functionalities described herein that are performed by the identity verification service the fraud detection service and or the CA in . Digital certificates e.g. that have been generated and managed by the digital certificate service may be communicated to a corresponding server computer that is associated with the network resource e.g. an instance and or a domain name e.g. the certificate is tied to. The digital certificate may then be stored locally by the digital certificate store of the corresponding server computer . As an alternative the generated digital certificate may also be stored by the digital certificate store associated with the managing server computer and communicated to the corresponding server computer as needed e.g. upon request by a customer entity that is using controlling and or paying for an instance .

The digital certificate service may be implemented as a stand alone service within the provider as a dedicated server similar to the servers A D and or may be implemented as part of the server computer that performs management functions. For example the digital certificate service may be implemented as part of the management component as seen in .

It should be appreciated that although the embodiments disclosed herein are described primarily in the context of virtual machines other types of instances can be utilized with the concepts and technologies disclosed herein. For instance the technologies disclosed herein can be utilized with storage resources data communications resources and with other types of computing resources. The embodiments disclosed herein might also execute all or a portion of an application directly on a computer system without utilizing virtual machine instances.

One or more server computers can be reserved for executing software components for managing the operation of the server computers the instances the hypervisors and or the digital certificate stores . For example the server computer can execute a management component . A customer can access the management component to configure various aspects of the operation of the instances purchased by the customer. For example the customer can purchase rent or lease instances and make changes to the configuration of the instances. The customer can also specify settings regarding how the purchased instances are to be scaled in response to demand. The management component can further include a policy document to implement customer policies.

The server computer may further comprise memory and a digital certificate store . The memory may be used as processing memory by the digital certificate service . The digital certificate store may be used to store digital certificates as explained above as well as it may include one or more databases for storing and maintaining customer account information e.g. authorization information used to authorize use control of a network resource by a customer entity and or authorization information used by the digital certificate service to authorize customer entities for issuing digital certificates . The digital certificate store may be implemented as part of the digital certificate service and or any of the other components of the server computer e.g. as part of the management component .

An auto scaling component can scale the instances based upon rules defined by the customer. In one embodiment the auto scaling component allows a customer to specify scale up rules for use in determining when new instances should be instantiated and scale down rules for use in determining when existing instances should be terminated. The auto scaling component can consist of a number of subcomponents executing on different server computers or other computing devices. The auto scaling component can monitor available computing resources over an internal management network and modify resources available based on need.

A deployment component can be used to assist customers in the deployment of new instances of computing resources. The deployment component can have access to account information associated with the instances such as who is the owner of the account credit card information country of the owner etc. The deployment component can receive a configuration from a customer that includes data describing how new instances should be configured. For example the configuration can specify one or more applications to be installed in new instances provide scripts and or other types of code to be executed for configuring new instances provide cache logic specifying how an application cache should be prepared and other types of information. The deployment component can utilize the customer provided configuration and cache logic to configure prime and launch new instances . The configuration cache logic and other information may be specified by a customer using the management component or by providing this information directly to the deployment component . The instance manager can be considered part of the deployment component.

Customer account information can include any desired information associated with a customer of the multi tenant environment. For example the customer account information can include a unique identifier for a customer a customer address billing information licensing information customization parameters for launching instances scheduling information auto scaling parameters previous IP addresses used to access the account and so forth.

A network can be utilized to interconnect the server computers A D and the server computer . The network can be a local area network LAN and can be connected to a Wide Area Network WAN so that end users can access the compute service provider . It should be appreciated that the network topology illustrated in has been simplified and that many more networks and networking devices can be utilized to interconnect the various computing systems disclosed herein.

In order to access and utilize instances such as instances of a customer device can be used. The customer device can be any of a variety of computing devices mobile or otherwise including a cell phone smartphone handheld computer Personal Digital Assistant PDA desktop computer etc. The customer device can communicate with the compute service provider through an end point which can be a DNS address designed to receive and process application programming interface API requests. In particular the end point can be a web server configured to expose an API. Using the API requests e.g. in a customer device can make requests to implement any of the functionality described herein e.g. request to authorize control usage and or payment for a network resource and or issuing a digital certificate in connection with one or more network resources . Other services which can be internal to the compute service provider can likewise make API requests to the end point . For example the customer device may use the API requests e.g. in to communicate a customer request for launching an instance and requesting a digital certificate associated with such instance.

Other general management services that may or may not be included in the compute service provider and or within the management component include an admission control e.g. one or more computers operating together as an admission control web service. The admission control can authenticate validate and unpack the API requests for service or storage of data within the compute service provider . The capacity tracker is responsible for determining how the servers need to be configured in order to meet the need for the different instance types by managing and configuring physical inventory in terms of forecasting provisioning and real time configuration and allocation of capacity. The capacity tracker maintains a pool of available inventory in a capacity pool database . The capacity tracker can also monitor capacity levels so as to know whether resources are readily available or limited.

An instance manager controls launching and termination of instances in the network. When an instruction is received such as through an API request to launch an instance the instance manager pulls resources from the capacity pool and launches the instance on a decided upon host server computer. Similar to the instance manager are the storage manager and the network resource manager . The storage manager relates to initiation and termination of storage volumes while the network resource manager relates to initiation and termination of routers switches subnets etc. A network of partitions is described further in relation to and includes a physical layer upon which the instances are launched.

The digital certificate service may include an identity verification service fraud detection service and a CA as explained herein. The digital certificate service may communicate with the capacity tracker to receive information regarding available partitions and or host servers that can be used for launching an instance or other network resources requested by a customer entity . Additionally communications with the admission control may be used to launch an instance and communications with the network of partitions may be used to push configuration changes as well as digital certificates onto hardware and or software resources of the host servers in order to effectuate functionalities described herein e.g. a digital certificate may be pushed to a corresponding server computer hosting the instance that is associated with the digital certificate and then stored at the digital certificate store at the corresponding server computer .

The router reads address information in a received packet and determines the packet s destination. If the router decides that a different data center contains a host server computer then the packet is forwarded to that data center. If the packet is addressed to a host in the data center then it is passed to a network address translator NAT that converts the packet s public IP address to a private IP address. The NAT also translates private addresses to public addresses that are bound outside of the data center . Additional routers can be coupled to the NAT to route packets to one or more racks of host server computers. Each rack can include a switch coupled to multiple host server computers. A particular host server computer is shown in an expanded view at .

Each host has underlying hardware including a network interface card NIC one or more CPUs e.g. processor memory e.g. memory a digital certificate store etc. The digital certificate store within the hardware layer may be used for storing one or more digital certificates e.g. associated with one or more of the partitions .

Running a layer above the hardware is a hypervisor or kernel layer . The hypervisor or kernel layer can be classified as a type 1 or type 2 hypervisor. A type 1 hypervisor runs directly on the host hardware to control the hardware and to manage the guest operating systems. A type 2 hypervisor runs within a conventional operating system environment. Thus in a type 2 environment the hypervisor can be a distinct layer running above the operating system and the operating system interacts with the system hardware. Different types of hypervisors include Xen based Hyper V ESXi ESX Linux etc. but other hypervisors can also be used.

A management layer can be part of the hypervisor or separated therefrom and generally includes device drivers needed for accessing the hardware . The partitions are logical units of isolation by the hypervisor. Each partition can be allocated its own portion of the hardware layer s memory CPU allocation storage etc. Additionally each partition can include a virtual machine its own guest operating system and its digital certificate e.g. associated with the virtual machine running on the corresponding partition . As such each partition is an abstract portion of capacity designed to support its own virtual machine independent of the other partitions.

In accordance with an example embodiment of the disclosure a digital certificate service e.g. may be used to implement functionalities related to provisioning of digital certificates as described herein.

At existing account information of the representative may be retrieved. For example the fraud detection service within the digital certificate service may retrieve the existing account information e.g. B associated with at least one service provided within the multi tenant network environment and used by the representative CR . At the identity of the representative and or the customer entity may be verified based at least in part on digital certificate authentication information within the API request. For example the identity verification service may verify validate the identity of the CR and or the CE using the CSR information e.g. verify customer entity is registered at the corporate address provided with the digital certificate application the customer entity is the registered legal owner of the domain name the digital certificate will be for and so forth . The identity verification service may also verify the representative CR is authorized to request the digital certificate for the domain name on behalf of the customer entity CE by matching the information authenticating the representative within the multi tenant network e.g. an email for the CR within the CR information with the requested domain name .

At at least one fraud metric may be generated for the representative and or the customer entity based on the retrieved existing account information. For example the fraud detection service may use the CSR information account login information email information existing account information B and or other fraud related information A e.g. information to generate the at least one fraud metric which is indicative of fraudulent activity associated with the representative and or the customer entity . The fraud metric may be generated based on matching data associated with the existing account information of the representative B with one or both of the information authenticating the representative within the multi tenant network environment e.g. and the digital certificate authentication information e.g. or any information authenticating the CE .

At the digital certificate service may determine whether to issue the digital certificate to the customer entity based on the identity verification confirmation and or the at least one fraud metric . For example the digital certificate service may issue the digital certificate to the customer entity and or the CR if the at least one fraud metric is below a threshold value and the identity is verified. The digital certificate service may decline to issue the digital certificate to the customer entity and or the CR if the at least one fraud metric is equal to or greater than the threshold value or the identity is not verified.

At at least one fraud metric may be generated for the customer entity based on historic account information of the customer entity in connection with using a service within the multi tenant network environment. For example the fraud detection service may use the CSR information account login information email information existing account information B and or other fraud related information A e.g. information to generate the at least one fraud metric which is indicative of fraudulent activity associated with the customer entity . The fraud metric may be generated based on matching data associated with the existing account information of the representative B with one or both of the information authenticating the representative within the multi tenant network environment e.g. and the digital certificate authentication information e.g. or any information authenticating the CE .

At it may be determined whether to issue the digital certificate to the customer entity based at least in part on the at least one fraud metric . For example the digital certificate service may issue the digital certificate to the customer entity and or the CR if the at least one fraud metric is below a threshold value. The digital certificate service may decline to issue the digital certificate to the customer entity and or the CR if the at least one fraud metric is equal to or greater than the threshold value.

In some instances the identity verification service may also be used to verify validate the identity of the CE and or the CR . For example the identity verification service may verify the identity of the customer entity based at least in part on the requested domain name and the public cryptographic key of the customer entity. Verification of the identity may further include verifying a representative e.g. CR of the customer entity submitting the API request is authorized to request the digital certificate for the domain name on behalf of the customer entity and or verifying the customer entity has ownership control of the requested domain name .

The service provided by the CSP may include for example a retail service a cloud storage service or a payment service and the historic account information B may include for example support request information length of service usage information location based information payment information shipping information and or purchase information as illustrated in detail in . The at least one fraud metric may be indicative of fraudulent activity associated with the customer entity in connection with previous use of the service within the multi tenant network environment.

The API request may be associated with information e.g. and or which may be communicated as part of CR information authenticating a representative CR of the customer entity within the multi tenant network environment for using the service.

The generating of the at least one fraud metric by the fraud detection service may further include matching data associated with the historic account information of the customer entity e.g. B with information authenticating the customer entity for using the at least one service within the multi tenant network environment e.g. CE information which may include information and or .

At existing account information of the customer entity may be retrieved. For example the fraud detection service within the digital certificate service may retrieve the existing account information e.g. B associated with at least one service provided within the multi tenant network environment and used by the customer entity CE . At the identity of the customer entity may be verified based at least in part on digital certificate authentication information within the API request. For example the identity verification service may verify validate the identity of the CE using the CSR information e.g. verify customer entity is registered at the corporate address provided with the digital certificate application the customer entity is the registered legal owner of the domain name the digital certificate will be for and so forth . The identity verification service may also verify the representative CR is authorized to request the digital certificate for the domain name on behalf of the customer entity CE by matching the information authenticating the representative within the multi tenant network e.g. an email for the CR within the CR information with the requested domain name .

At at least one fraud metric may be generated for the customer entity based on the retrieved existing account information. For example the fraud detection service may use the CSR information account login information email information existing account information B and or other fraud related information A e.g. information to generate the at least one fraud metric which is indicative of fraudulent activity associated with the customer entity and or the representative in connection with using at least one service provided within the multi tenant environment. The fraud metric may be generated based on matching data associated with the existing account information of the representative B with one or both of the information authenticating the representative within the multi tenant network environment e.g. and the digital certificate authentication information e.g. or any information authenticating the CE .

At the digital certificate service may determine whether to issue the digital certificate to the customer entity based on the identity verification confirmation and or the at least one fraud metric . For example the digital certificate service may issue the digital certificate to the customer entity and or the CR if the at least one fraud metric is below a threshold value and the identity is verified. The digital certificate service may decline to issue the digital certificate to the customer entity and or the CR if the at least one fraud metric is equal to or greater than the threshold value or the identity is not verified.
