Aspects of this disclosure relate to wireless communications systems. In particular aspects of this disclosure relate to continuity maintenance of a peer to peer group session when a member of the peer to peer group exits a coverage area.

Wireless communication systems have developed through various generations including a first generation analog wireless phone service 1G a second generation 2G digital wireless phone service including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks and third generation 3G and fourth generation 4G high speed data Internet capable wireless services. There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use including Cellular and Personal Communications Service PCS systems. Examples of known cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System AMPS and digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access CDMA Frequency Division Multiple Access FDMA Time Division Multiple Access TDMA the Global System for Mobile access GSM variation of TDMA and newer hybrid digital communication systems using both TDMA and CDMA technologies.

More recently Long Term Evolution LTE has been developed as a wireless communications protocol for wireless communication of high speed data for mobile phones and other data terminals. LTE is based on GSM and includes contributions from various GSM related protocols such as Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution EDGE and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS protocols such as High Speed Packet Access HSPA .

In recent years usage of direct peer to peer P2P communications has increased. LTE Direct LTE D is a proposed 3GPP Release 12 device to device D2D solution for proximate discovery. LTE D dispenses with location tracking and network calls by directly monitoring for services on other LTE D devices within a large range 500 m line of sight . It does so continuously in a synchronous system that is battery efficient and can concurrently detect thousands of services in proximity.

LTE D operates on licensed spectrum as a service to mobile applications. LTE D enables service layer discovery. Mobile applications on LTE D devices can instruct LTE D to set a monitor for mobile application services on other devices. Moreover mobile applications on LTE D devices can announce their own services for detection by other LTE D devices at the physical layer. The applications can be closed while LTE D works continuously and notifies the client application when it detects a match to the set monitor.

LTE D is thus an attractive alternative to mobile developers seeking to deploy proximate discovery solutions as extensions of their existing cloud services. LTE D is a distributed discovery solution versus the centralized discovery that exists today whereby mobile applications forego centralized database processing in identifying relevancy matches instead autonomously determining relevance at the device level by transmitting and monitoring for relevant attributes. LTE D offers certain benefits in terms of privacy as well as power consumption in that LTE D does not utilize perpetual location tracking to determine proximity. By keeping discovery on the device rather than in the cloud the user has more control of what information is shared with external devices.

The LTE wireless communications protocol enables LTE D devices to discover one another join an LTE D group and establish D2D direct data traffic connections among the members of the LTE D group by configuring LTE D parameters. For example the LTE network may configure an interval at which LTE D devices announce themselves allocate channel resources for LTE D sessions etc. As a result a problem arises when an LTE D device performing LTE D group communications leaves the radio access area of the LTE network. Solutions are needed for seamless continuation of communications among members of an LTE D group when one of the members exits the radio access area of the LTE network.

In one aspect the present disclosure provides a method for a UE in a P2P group to maintain continuity of a P2P group session. The method may comprise for example exchanging a first P2P group session communication with a member of the P2P group via a direct data traffic connection requesting session data from an application server conveying the session data to a proxy UE wherein the proxy UE is a member of the P2P group and exchanging a second P2P group session communication with the application server in accordance with the session data.

In another aspect the present disclosure provides a computer readable medium comprising code which when executed by a processor causes the processor to perform operations for maintaining continuity of a P2P group session. The computer readable medium may comprise for example code for exchanging a first P2P group session communication with a member of the P2P group via a direct data traffic connection code for requesting session data from an application server code for conveying the session data to a proxy UE wherein the proxy UE is a member of the P2P group and code for exchanging a second P2P group session communication with the application server in accordance with the session data.

In another aspect the present disclosure provides another apparatus for maintaining continuity of a P2P group session. The apparatus may comprise for example means for exchanging a first P2P group session communication with a member of the P2P group via a direct data traffic connection means for requesting session data from an application server means for conveying the session data to a proxy UE wherein the proxy UE is a member of the P2P group and means for exchanging a second P2P group session communication with the application server in accordance with the session data.

In another aspect the present disclosure provides an apparatus for maintaining continuity of a P2P group session. The apparatus may comprise a memory and a processor. The processor may for example exchange a first P2P group session communication with a member of the P2P group via a direct data traffic connection request session data from an application server convey the session data to a proxy UE wherein the proxy UE is a member of the P2P group and exchange a second P2P group session communication with the application server in accordance with the session data.

In addition for each of the embodiments described herein the corresponding form of any such embodiments may be described herein as for example logic configured to perform the described action.

A client device referred to herein as a user equipment UE may be mobile or stationary and may communicate with a radio access network RAN . As used herein the term UE may be referred to interchangeably as an access terminal or AT a wireless device a subscriber device a subscriber terminal a subscriber station a user terminal or UT a mobile terminal a mobile station and variations thereof. Generally UEs can communicate with a core network via the RAN and through the core network the UEs can be connected with external networks such as the Internet. Of course other mechanisms of connecting to the core network and or the Internet are also possible for the UEs such as over wired access networks WiFi networks e.g. based on IEEE 802.11 etc. and so on. UEs can be embodied by any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC cards compact flash devices external or internal modems wireless or wireline phones and so on. A communication link through which UEs can send signals to the RAN is called an uplink channel e.g. a reverse traffic channel a reverse control channel an access channel etc. . A communication link through which the RAN can send signals to UEs is called a downlink or forward link channel e.g. a paging channel a control channel a broadcast channel a forward traffic channel etc. . As used herein the term traffic channel TCH can refer to either an uplink reverse or downlink forward traffic channel.

Referring to UEs . . . N are configured to communicate with an access network e.g. the RAN an access point etc. over a physical communications interface or layer shown in as air interfaces and or a direct wired connection. The air interfaces and can comply with a given cellular communications protocol e.g. CDMA EVDO eHRPD GSM EDGE W CDMA LTE etc. while the air interface can comply with a wireless IP protocol e.g. IEEE 802.11 . The RAN includes a plurality of access points that serve UEs over air interfaces such as the air interfaces and . The access points in the RAN can be referred to as access nodes or ANs access points or APs base stations or BSs Node Bs eNode Bs and so on. These access points can be terrestrial access points or ground stations or satellite access points. The RAN is configured to connect to a core network that can perform a variety of functions including bridging circuit switched CS calls between UEs served by the RAN and other UEs served by the RAN or a different RAN altogether and can also mediate an exchange of packet switched PS data with external networks such as Internet . The Internet includes a number of routing agents and processing agents not shown in for the sake of convenience . In UE N is shown as connecting to the Internet directly i.e. separate from the core network such as over an Ethernet connection of WiFi or 802.11 based network . The Internet can thereby function to bridge packet switched data communications between UE N and UEs . . . N via the core network . Also shown in is the access point that is separate from the RAN . The access point may be connected to the Internet independent of the core network e.g. via an optical communication system such as FiOS a cable modem etc. . The air interface may serve UE or UE over a local wireless connection such as IEEE 802.11 in an example. UE N is shown as a desktop computer with a wired connection to the Internet such as a direct connection to a modem or router which can correspond to the access point itself in an example e.g. for a WiFi router with both wired and wireless connectivity .

Referring to an application server is shown as connected to the Internet the core network or both. The application server can be implemented as a plurality of structurally separate servers or alternately may correspond to a single server. As will be described below in more detail the application server is configured to support one or more communication services e.g. Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP sessions Push to Talk PTT sessions group communication sessions social networking services etc. for UEs that can connect to the application server via the core network and or the Internet .

An example of a protocol specific implementations for the RAN and the core network is provided below in to help explain the wireless communications system in more detail. In particular the components of the RAN and the core network correspond to components associated with supporting packet switched PS communications. Legacy circuit switched CS components may also be present in these networks but any legacy CS specific components are not shown explicitly in .

In the core network includes a plurality of Mobility Management Entities MMEs and a Home Subscriber Server HSS a Serving Gateway S GW a Packet Data Network Gateway P GW and a Policy and Charging Rules Function PCRF . Network interfaces between these components the RAN and the Internet are illustrated in and are defined in Table 1 below as follows 

A high level description of the components shown in the RAN and core network of will now be described. However these components are each well known in the art from various 3GPP TS standards and the description contained herein is not intended to be an exhaustive description of all functionalities performed by these components.

Referring to the MMEs and are configured to manage the control plane signaling for the EPS bearers. MME functions include Non Access Stratum NAS signaling NAS signaling security Mobility management for inter and intra technology handovers P GW and S GW selection and MME selection for handovers with MME change.

Referring to the S GW is the gateway that terminates the interface toward the RAN . For each UE associated with the core network for an EPS based system at a given point of time there is a single S GW. The functions of the S GW for both the GTP based and the Proxy Mobile IPv6 PMIP based S5 S8 include Mobility anchor point Packet routing and forwarding and setting the DiffSery Code Point DSCP based on a QoS Class Identifier QCI of the associated EPS bearer.

Referring to the P GW is the gateway that terminates the SGi interface toward the Packet Data Network PDN e.g. the Internet . If a UE is accessing multiple PDNs there may be more than one P GW for that UE however a mix of S5 S8 connectivity and Gn Gp connectivity is not typically supported for that UE simultaneously. P GW functions include for both the GTP based S5 S8 Packet filtering by deep packet inspection UE IP address allocation setting the DSCP based on the QCI of the associated EPS bearer accounting for inter operator charging uplink UL and downlink DL bearer binding as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 UL bearer binding verification as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203. The P GW provides PDN connectivity to both GSM EDGE Radio Access Network GERAN UTRAN only UEs and E UTRAN capable UEs using any of E UTRAN GERAN or UTRAN. The P GW provides PDN connectivity to E UTRAN capable UEs using E UTRAN only over the S5 S8 interface.

Referring to the PCRF is the policy and charging control element of the EPS based core network . In a non roaming scenario there is a single PCRF in the HPLMN associated with a UE s Internet Protocol Connectivity Access Network IP CAN session. The PCRF terminates the Rx interface and the Gx interface. In a roaming scenario with local breakout of traffic there may be two PCRFs associated with a UE s IP CAN session A Home PCRF H PCRF is a PCRF that resides within a HPLMN and a Visited PCRF V PCRF is a PCRF that resides within a visited VPLMN. PCRF is described in more detail in 3GPP TS 23.203 and as such will not be described further for the sake of brevity. In the application server e.g. which can be referred to as the AF in 3GPP terminology is shown as connected to the core network via the Internet or alternatively to the PCRF directly via an Rx interface. Generally the application server or AF is an element offering applications that use IP bearer resources with the core network e.g. UMTS PS domain GPRS domain resources LTE PS data services . One example of an application function is the Proxy Call Session Control Function P CSCF of the IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS Core Network sub system. The AF uses the Rx reference point to provide session information to the PCRF . Any other application server offering IP data services over cellular network can also be connected to the PCRF via the Rx reference point.

While internal components of UEs such as the UEs A and B can be embodied with different hardware configurations a basic high level UE configuration for internal hardware components is shown as platform in . The platform can receive and execute software applications data and or commands transmitted from the RAN that may ultimately come from the core network the Internet and or other remote servers and networks e.g. application server web URLs etc. . The platform can also independently execute locally stored applications without RAN interaction. The platform can include a transceiver operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or other processor microprocessor logic circuit or other data processing device. The ASIC or other processor executes the application programming interface API layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory of the wireless device. The memory can be comprised of read only or random access memory RAM and ROM EEPROM flash cards or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform also can include a local database that can store applications not actively used in memory as well as other data. The local database is typically a flash memory cell but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art such as magnetic media EEPROM optical media tape soft or hard disk or the like.

Accordingly an embodiment of the invention can include a UE e.g. UE A B etc. including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example ASIC memory API and local database may all be used cooperatively to load store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore the features of the UEs A and B in are to be considered merely illustrative and the invention is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.

The wireless communication between the UEs A and or B and the RAN can be based on different technologies such as CDMA W CDMA time division multiple access TDMA frequency division multiple access FDMA Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing OFDM GSM or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. As discussed in the foregoing and known in the art voice transmission and or data can be transmitted to the UEs from the RAN using a variety of networks and configurations. Accordingly the illustrations provided herein are not intended to limit the embodiments of the invention and are merely to aid in the description of aspects of embodiments of the invention.

Referring to the communication device includes logic configured to receive and or transmit information . In an example if the communication device corresponds to a wireless communications device e.g. UE A or B one of eNodeBs through etc. the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can include a wireless communications interface e.g. Bluetooth WiFi 2G CDMA W CDMA 3G 4G LTE etc. such as a wireless transceiver and associated hardware e.g. an RF antenna a MODEM a modulator and or demodulator etc. . In another example the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can correspond to a wired communications interface e.g. a serial connection a USB or Firewire connection an Ethernet connection through which the Internet can be accessed etc. . Thus if the communication device corresponds to some type of network based server e.g. PDSN SGSN GGSN S GW P GW MME HSS PCRF the application etc. the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can correspond to an Ethernet card in an example that connects the network based server to other communication entities via an Ethernet protocol. In a further example the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can include sensory or measurement hardware by which the communication device can monitor its local environment e.g. an accelerometer a temperature sensor a light sensor an antenna for monitoring local RF signals etc. . The logic configured to receive and or transmit information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to receive and or transmit information to perform its reception and or transmission function s . However the logic configured to receive and or transmit information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to receive and or transmit information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further includes logic configured to process information . In an example the logic configured to process information can include at least a processor. Example implementations of the type of processing that can be performed by the logic configured to process information includes but is not limited to performing determinations establishing connections making selections between different information options performing evaluations related to data interacting with sensors coupled to the communication device to perform measurement operations converting information from one format to another e.g. between different protocols such as .wmv to .avi etc. and so on. For example the processor included in the logic configured to process information can correspond to a general purpose processor a digital signal processor DSP an ASIC a field programmable gate array FPGA or other programmable logic device discrete gate or transistor logic discrete hardware components or any combination thereof designed to perform the functions described herein. A general purpose processor may be a microprocessor but in the alternative the processor may be any conventional processor controller microcontroller or state machine. A processor may also be implemented as a combination of computing devices e.g. a combination of a DSP and a microprocessor a plurality of microprocessors one or more microprocessors in conjunction with a DSP core or any other such configuration. The logic configured to process information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to process information to perform its processing function s . However the logic configured to process information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to process information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further includes logic configured to store information . In an example the logic configured to store information can include at least a non transitory memory and associated hardware e.g. a memory controller etc. . For example the non transitory memory included in the logic configured to store information can correspond to RAM memory flash memory ROM memory EPROM memory EEPROM memory registers hard disk a removable disk a CD ROM or any other form of storage medium known in the art. The logic configured to store information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to store information to perform its storage function s . However the logic configured to store information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to store information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further optionally includes logic configured to present information . In an example the logic configured to present information can include at least an output device and associated hardware. For example the output device can include a video output device e.g. a display screen a port that can carry video information such as USB HDMI etc. an audio output device e.g. speakers a port that can carry audio information such as a microphone jack USB HDMI etc. a vibration device and or any other device by which information can be formatted for output or actually outputted by a user or operator of the communication device . For example if the communication device corresponds to UE A or UE B as shown in the logic configured to present information can include the display A of UE A or the touchscreen display B of UE B. In a further example the logic configured to present information can be omitted for certain communication devices such as network communication devices that do not have a local user e.g. network switches or routers remote servers etc. . The logic configured to present information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to present information to perform its presentation function s . However the logic configured to present information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to present information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further optionally includes logic configured to receive local user input . In an example the logic configured to receive local user input can include at least a user input device and associated hardware. For example the user input device can include buttons a touchscreen display a keyboard a camera an audio input device e.g. a microphone or a port that can carry audio information such as a microphone jack etc. and or any other device by which information can be received from a user or operator of the communication device . For example if the communication device corresponds to UE A or UE B as shown in the logic configured to receive local user input can include the keypad A any of the buttons A or B through B the touchscreen display B etc. In a further example the logic configured to receive local user input can be omitted for certain communication devices such as network communication devices that do not have a local user e.g. network switches or routers remote servers etc. . The logic configured to receive local user input can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to receive local user input to perform its input reception function s . However the logic configured to receive local user input does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to receive local user input relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to while the configured logics of through are shown as separate or distinct blocks in it will be appreciated that the hardware and or software by which the respective configured logic performs its functionality can overlap in part. For example any software used to facilitate the functionality of the configured logics of through can be stored in the non transitory memory associated with the logic configured to store information such that the configured logics of through each performs their functionality i.e. in this case software execution based in part upon the operation of software stored by the logic configured to store information . Likewise hardware that is directly associated with one of the configured logics can be borrowed or used by other configured logics from time to time. For example the processor of the logic configured to process information can format data into an appropriate format before being transmitted by the logic configured to receive and or transmit information such that the logic configured to receive and or transmit information performs its functionality i.e. in this case transmission of data based in part upon the operation of hardware i.e. the processor associated with the logic configured to process information .

Generally unless stated otherwise explicitly the phrase logic configured to as used throughout this disclosure is intended to invoke an embodiment that is at least partially implemented with hardware and is not intended to map to software only implementations that are independent of hardware. Also it will be appreciated that the configured logic or logic configured to in the various blocks are not limited to specific logic gates or elements but generally refer to the ability to perform the functionality described herein either via hardware or a combination of hardware and software . Thus the configured logics or logic configured to as illustrated in the various blocks are not necessarily implemented as logic gates or logic elements despite sharing the word logic. Other interactions or cooperation between the logic in the various blocks will become clear to one of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the embodiments described below in more detail.

The various embodiments may be implemented on any of a variety of commercially available server devices such as server illustrated in . In an example the server may correspond to one example configuration of the application server described above. In the server includes a processor coupled to volatile memory and a large capacity nonvolatile memory such as a disk drive . The server may also include a floppy disc drive compact disc CD or DVD disc drive coupled to the processor . The server may also include network access ports coupled to the processor for establishing data connections with a network such as a local area network coupled to other broadcast system computers and servers or to the Internet. In context with it will be appreciated that the server of illustrates one example implementation of the communication device whereby the logic configured to transmit and or receive information corresponds to the network access ports used by the server to communicate with the network the logic configured to process information corresponds to the processor and the logic configuration to store information corresponds to any combination of the volatile memory the disk drive and or the disc drive . The optional logic configured to present information and the optional logic configured to receive local user input are not shown explicitly in and may or may not be included therein. Thus helps to demonstrate that the communication device may be implemented as a server in addition to a UE implementation as in A or B as in .

In accordance with various exemplary embodiments described herein one or more of UE UE UE UE UE and UE may support direct P2P communications e.g. D2D communications whereby such UEs may support communicating with one another directly without having to communicate through another device or a network infrastructure element such as the first base station and the second base station and also support communications through the network infrastructure elements such as the first base station and or the second base station . In communications that involve network infrastructure signals may generally be transmitted and received through uplink and downlink connections between various UEs and the base stations such as link in the first cell and link in the second cell . Each of the base stations generally serve as the attachment point for the UEs in the corresponding cells and facilitate communications between the UEs served therein. In accordance with one aspect when two or more UEs such as UE and UE wish to communicate with one another and are located in sufficient proximity to each other then a direct P2P link can be established there between which may offload traffic from the base station serving the UEs allow UEs to communicate more efficiently or provide other advantages that will be apparent to those skilled in the art.

As shown in the UE can communicate with UE through intermediate base station via link and UEs may further communicate via a P2P link . Similarly UEs may communicate through intermediate base station via link and further communicate via a P2P link . Furthermore for inter cell communications where the participating UEs are in different nearby cells a direct P2P communications link is still a possibility which is illustrated in where UE and UE may communicate using direct P2P communications illustrated by P2P link .

In one possible scenario P2P link and P2P link are D2D links utilizing LTE D technology. LTE D is a proposed 3GPP Release 12 D2D solution for proximate discovery. LTE D dispenses with location tracking and network calls by directly monitoring for services on other LTE D devices within a large range 500 m line of sight . It does so continuously in a synchronous system that is battery efficient and can concurrently detect thousands of services in proximity. LTE D has a wider range than other D2D P2P technologies such as WiFi Direct WFD or Bluetooth. Two alternative communications systems for implementing LTE D communication sessions are depicted in and . In the system of an LTE D group is formed within an LTE wireless communication system without network assistance. In the system of by contrast an LTE D group is formed within an LTE wireless communication system with the network assistance of evolved packet core EPC .

In the LTE wireless communication system is associated with a base station e.g. eNB through base station base station etc. . The base station communicates on uplink and downlink with a first UE a second UE and a third UE e.g. UE A B etc. . The LTE wireless communication system has an LTE coverage area . Although only three UEs are depicted it will be understood that any number of UEs may be included in the LTE D group . Moreover the LTE D group is formed with D2D data traffic link transmitted among UE UE and UE

In the LTE wireless communication system is associated with a base station e.g. eNB through base station base station etc. . The base station communicates on uplink and downlink with a first UE a second UE and a third UE e.g. UE A B etc. . The LTE wireless communication system has an LTE coverage area . An LTE D group is formed among UE UE and UE e.g. UE A B etc. . Although only three UEs are depicted it will be understood that any number of UEs may be included in the LTE D group . The D2D data traffic link and the D2D data traffic link route D2D data traffic among the members of the LTE D group with assistance from the EPC .

The LTE D group and the LTE D group may exchange data in the form of a P2P group session communication. A P2P group session communication may refer to any media exchange activity. The P2P group session may be set up using a signaling exchange in accordance with for example session initiation protocols SIP . For example an SIP INVITE code may be used to indicate to a UE e.g. first UE etc. that the UE is invited to participate in a P2P group session. The UE may return an SIP 200 OK code that includes information on the UE s capabilities. An SIP ACK code may be used to confirm that the SIP 200 OK code or some other code has been received. Other suitable signaling exchanges for initiating or setting up a P2P group session may be utilized. After the group session has been initiated media may be exchanged including real time media exchange of streamed voice or video using for example Real time Transport Protocol TRP or non real time data transfer using for example Message Session Relay Protocol MSRP .

As noted above LTE wireless communication system and LTE wireless communication system facilitate formation of the LTE D groups. LTE D group for example utilizes a D2D data traffic link to facilitate communication between member UEs . However a problem arises when one of the member UEs exits the radio access coverage area of the LTE wireless communication system . Solutions are needed for seamless continuation of communications among members of an LTE D group when one of the members exits the coverage area of the LTE network.

The remaining members of the LTE D group UE and UE in this scenario are still communicating with one another on the D2D data traffic link . However because UE exits the LTE coverage area the D2D data traffic link breaks and the remaining UEs and are unable to communicate with UE . The broken D2D data traffic link represents for example a failed broken or incomplete D2D data transmission between a UE or within the LTE coverage area and a UE in the non LTE coverage area .

In accordance with an aspect of the disclosure illustrates a flow diagram according to which a UE e.g. UE A UE B UE etc. selects a proxy UE e.g. proxy UE etc. from within an LTE D group e.g. LTE D group LTE D group etc. . At a P2P group is discovered. P2P group discovery may comprise for example LTE D group discovery as set forth in and the related disclosure.

UEs that perform LTE D communications rely upon expressions to facilitate discovery of and communication with proximate peers. Expressions at the application or service layer are referred to as expression names e.g. ShirtSale Gap.com Jane Facebook.com etc. . Expression names at the application layer are mapped to bit strings at the physical layer that are referred to as expression codes . Discovery in LTE D operates in a synchronous manner based on parameters that are configured by the LTE network itself e.g. LTE wireless communications system etc. . For example frequency division duplexing FDD and or time division duplexing TDD may be assigned by a serving eNode B e.g. base station etc. via a physical layer Session Information Block SIB . The serving eNode B can also configure an interval at which LTE D devices are to announce themselves e.g. every 20 seconds etc. via transmission of a discovery message. In accordance with the proxy selection depicted in flow diagram a UE may perform P2P group discovery in compliance with any of the aforementioned LTE D processes described herein. After two or more LTE D devices discover each other the LTE network may be required to authorize establishment of the LTE D session referred to herein as network assisted connection setup. P2P group discovery may further comprise any UE operations necessary to enable network assisted connection setup.

At the UE optionally initiates a P2P group session or joins an initiated P2P group session that was discovered at . The P2P group may comprise an LTE D group e.g. LTE D group LTE D group etc. . Once the optional P2P group initiation joining is complete the members of the P2P group may communicate using D2D data traffic links e.g. D2D data traffic link D2D data traffic link etc. .

At the UE exchanges capability data with one or more other UEs within the P2P group. Generally capability data may comprise any data that relates to the suitability of a UE to serve as a proxy UE for the P2P group e.g. proxy UE of LTE D group etc. .

In one possible example of capability data exchange a first UE collects first capability data on at least one characteristic of the first UE . The characteristic may be any characteristic that relates to the suitability of the first UE for serving as a proxy UE. The characteristic may comprise wireless access e.g. wireless local area network WLAN access RAN access etc. wireless coverage signal strength etc. maximum battery life remaining battery life maximum processing power available processing power or the like. In another possible scenario the capability data includes data relating to a plurality of characteristics.

The capability data may be exchanged using a D2D data traffic link e.g. D2D data traffic link etc. uplink and downlink via a base station e.g. uplink downlink etc. or by any other suitable transmission method. To return to the example of capability data exchange involving first UE capability data collection may be followed by transmission of the first capability data to at least one second UE . The first capability data may further be transmitted to each UE within the LTE D group . In addition the first UE may also receive second capability data from the second UE . The second capability data may further be received from each UE within the LTE D group . The second capability data associated with for example second UE may be collected by second UE in the same manner that the first capability data was collected by the first UE . In one possible scenario each UE in a P2P group for example LTE D group collects capability data regarding its own suitability for serving as proxy UE transmits the collected capability data to each of the other UEs in the P2P group and receives collected capability data from each of the other UEs in the P2P group.

At the UE selects a proxy UE e.g. proxy UE etc. from among the UEs in the P2P group e.g. LTE D group etc. on the basis of the capability data exchanged at . As noted above the capability data may comprise any data that relates to the suitability of a UE to serve as a proxy UE for the P2P group. For example a UE with a high level of WLAN access may be associated with a greater suitability to serve as the proxy UE and the UE may be selected as the proxy UE on that basis. In another example a UE with a high level of battery life or a high level of available processing power may be associated with a greater suitability to server as the proxy UE and the UE may be selected as the proxy UE on that basis. In yet another example proxy UE selection is made primarily on the basis of WLAN access whereas battery life and processing power characteristics are of secondary importance.

At the UE optionally initiates a P2P group session or joins an initiated P2P group session which was discovered at . If optional P2P group initiation joining was omitted then the UE may initiate join the P2P group session at instead. It will be further understood that the UE may alternatively initiate join the discovered P2P group session between capability data exchange and proxy UE selection or omit initiation joining entirely.

In one possible example of proxy UE selection a first UE after exchanging capability data at with at least one second UE selects a proxy UE by ranking the first UE and the at least one second UE on the basis of the exchanged capability data. At the first UE selects the proxy UE on the basis of the rankings.

It will be understood that the proxy selection depicted in flow diagram is performed by a single UE. Moreover each UE in a given coverage area e.g. LTE coverage area LTE coverage area etc. or a portion thereof may individually perform the proxy selection depicted in flow diagram .

In one possible scenario each UE in the LTE D group independently selects the proxy UE in accordance with the proxy selection depicted in flow diagram . In this scenario this capability data is exchanged at among each of the plurality of UEs in the LTE D group such that each of the plurality of UEs uses the same data to select the proxy UE . Moreover suitability to serve as proxy UE is determined according to a predetermined formula or algorithm such that each of the plurality of UEs in the LTE D group independently comes to the same conclusion at as to which of the plurality of UEs should be selected as the proxy UE. Optionally the proxy UE acknowledges its selection with an acknowledge message transmitted to one or more of the unselected members UEs in the LTE D group . The proxy selection depicted in flow diagram may conclude with transmission of this acknowledge message if is performed by the member UE that happens to be selected as the proxy UE or receipt of the acknowledge message from the proxy UE if is performed by an unselected member UE .

In another possible scenario a single UE is arbitrarily selected to perform the proxy selection depicted in flow diagram . The arbitrary selection may be on the basis of first to join the P2P group originator of the P2P group self selection random selection or any other suitable basis. In this scenario the selecting UE collects capability data regarding its own suitability to serve as in receives capability data from each of the other UEs in the P2P group as in and selects the proxy UE for the P2P group as in . In this scenario proxy UE selection may further comprise a transmission to each member of the P2P group identifying which of the members is to serve as the proxy UE. In another possible scenario the proxy UE continuously practices the proxy selection depicted in flow diagram and continues to perform as the proxy UE for as long as the proxy UE continues to be indicated at proxy UE selection . In the event that another member UE is selected at proxy UE selection a message is transmitted to each member UE which identifies the new proxy UE.

In the handover UE has entered a non LTE coverage area similar to the non LTE coverage area depicted in . Because the D2D data traffic link no longer exists the handover UE cannot experience seamless continuation of communication with the remaining members of the LTE D group unless other links are utilized. shows a first link between the handover UE and an application server . Other intervening elements may facilitate establishment and or utilization of the first link . These intervening elements may comprise one or more of the elements depicted in including for example RAN core network and or internet . Alternatively the intervening elements may be omitted entirely. Also depicted is a second link between the application server and a radio access network similar to RAN as shown in any of and . The RAN is shown as an evolved packet core and packet gateway similar to the elements depicted in . In some scenarios the intervening elements are used not used or reused to assist in the establishment and or utilization of the second link . The second link may be established and or utilized using the Rx or SGi signals described above in relation to . Also depicted is a third link between the RAN depicted as an evolved packet core and packet gateway and the base station . The third link may be established and utilized using the Si signals described above in relation to . Finally a fourth link is established and or utilized between the base station and the proxy UE . By utilizing these links the handover UE can seamlessly maintain communications with the proxy UE . Moreover the proxy UE can be used to relay communications between handover UE and one or more remaining members of the LTE D group for example second UE

It will further be understood that one or more additional handover UEs similar to handover UE may exit the LTE coverage area and enter non LTE coverage area . Alternatively the additional handover UEs may enter an entirely different non LTE coverage area. Each of these additional handover UEs may simultaneously maintain seamless continuity with the remaining members of the LTE D group so long as one member remains in the LTE coverage area to serve as the proxy UE .

It will be understood that as circumstances change a new proxy UE may be selected. In a first possible scenario the proxy UE leaves the LTE coverage area . In this scenario a new proxy UE is selected in accordance with the proxy selection depicted in flow diagram or a modification thereof. In a second possible scenario the proxy UE does not leave the LTE coverage but a newly joining UE previously not a member of the LTE D group newly joins the LTE D group thereby affording an opportunity to select a new and potentially more suitable proxy UE. In a third possible scenario the capability data associated with one or more of the UEs in the LTE D group changes and the proxy UE is no longer the most suitable UE to serve as the proxy UE.

In each of the foregoing scenarios the proxy selection depicted in flow diagram may be modified such that P2P group discovery and P2P group joining are omitted. Instead capability data exchange is triggered by any one of a number of circumstances. According to the first scenario the proxy UE may conclude that exit from the LTE coverage area and entry into a non LTE coverage area is imminent and may further communicate this conclusion to the members of the LTE D group . Such a communication would trigger a capability data exchange among the members of the LTE D group still to remain within the coverage area . It will be understood that those members of the LTE D group which are outside of the LTE coverage area e.g. handover UE handover UE need not participate in the capability data exchange . Alternatively the base station may conclude that proxy UE has left the LTE coverage area and communicate this conclusion to the LTE D group . A conclusion that proxy is powering down leaving the LTE D group or entering a non LTE coverage area may also trigger selection of a new proxy UE.

According to the second scenario each joining of a new UE to the LTE D group triggers selection of a new proxy UE. According to the third scenario the proxy UE may conclude that its suitability to serve as the proxy UE has decreased and initiate an exchange of capability data . Alternatively a member of the LTE D group within the LTE coverage area may conclude that its suitability to serve as the proxy UE has increased an initiate an exchange of capability data . In yet another implementation an exchange of capability data is triggered at intermittent intervals for all UEs that are within the LTE coverage area or members of the LTE D group .

In a handover UE experiences seamless continuation of communication with the remaining members of the LTE D group by establishing and utilizing other links. shows a first link between the handover UE and the application server . The optional intervening elements may facilitate establishment and or utilization of the first link . The second link is established between the application server and the RAN shown as an evolved packet core and packet gateway similar to analogous elements depicted in . In some scenarios the intervening elements are used not used or reused to assist in the establishment and or utilization of the second link . Instead of the third link and fourth link depicted in the communications network utilizes the D2D data traffic link and the D2D data traffic link to route D2D data traffic among the remaining members of the LTE D group UE and UE

In accordance with an aspect of the disclosure illustrates a flow diagram according to which a UE e.g. UE A UE B UE etc. maintains P2P group session continuity with members of an LTE D group e.g. LTE D group LTE D group etc. throughout handover to a non LTE radio access technology. At a UE exchanges a first P2P group session communication with a member UE of an LTE D group. As an example see in which UE and UE handover UE both member of LTE D group exchange communications via D2D data traffic link .

At the handover UE requests session data from an application server for example application server as depicted in . However prior to requesting session data the handover UE may optionally make an imminent handover determination that a handover to a non LTE radio access technology is imminent. The imminent handover determination may be particularly advantageous if handover UE is a multimode UE which fully utilizes both LTE radio access technologies and non LTE radio access technologies. In this case a system selection procedure may indicate that an inter system handover is imminent and this indication can be used to make the imminent handover determination . In one possible scenario the handover UE does not request session data unless it first makes an imminent handover determination that a handover to a non LTE radio access technology is imminent.

On the other hand the handover UE may determine to proceed to request session data without first making an imminent handover determination that a handover to a non LTE radio access technology is imminent. In one possible scenario the handover UE is a single mode UE which is not capable of making the imminent handover determination . In this scenario the handover UE may proceed to request session data in response to any number of suitable triggers for example at least one of discovering the P2P group session joining the P2P group session exchanging data within the P2P group session as in identifying the proxy UE communicating with the proxy UE or a combination thereof.

Returning to the handover UE requests session data from application server . The handover UE may communicate with the application server in accordance with any suitable method including but not limited to those set forth in the present disclosure for example in or . The session data comprises any data that can be used by a UE e.g. handover UE proxy UE etc. to locate identify and or communicate with the application server or be located be identified or be communicated with by the application server . Session data request may include processing necessary for re sending the request receiving a response to the request and or processing the response in preparation for session data conveyance .

At the handover UE conveys session data to the proxy UE . The handover UE may communicate with the proxy UE in accordance with any suitable method including but not limited to those set forth in the present disclosure for example in or . It will be understood that the proxy UE may be selected or identified in accordance with any suitable process including but not limited to the proxy UE selection processes set forth in the present disclosure for example the proxy UE selection process depicted in . Session data conveyance may include processing necessary for re sending the conveyance and or receiving a response to the conveyance.

At the handover UE exchanges a second P2P group session communication with the application server . The exchange may occur prior during or after the handover UE has exited an LTE coverage area for example LTE coverage area and may occur prior during or after the handover UE has entered a non LTE coverage area for example non LTE coverage area . The second P2P group session communication exchange may comprise transmission of data to the application server for purposes of relay to the LTE D group or reception of data from the application server which has been relayed from the LTE D group .

At the handover UE optionally decides to hand over to a non LTE coverage area e.g. non LTE coverage area . As noted above with respect to this decision may be omitted in accordance with design considerations. For single mode UEs in particular it may be advantageous to begin the signaling flow with application server identification .

At the handover UE identifies an application server e.g. application server etc. . In one possible scenario the application server identification comprises acquisition of the internet protocol address and port of the application server via a domain name server. Additionally or alternatively this information may be pre provisioned to the handover UE

After application server identification is complete the handover UE requests a session reservation at . A session reservation request is sent to the application server in accordance with any suitable communications method. In one possible scenario the session reservation request comprises a request for a session ticket. At in response to the session reservation request the application server may grant the session reservation and send a grant notification to the handover UE . The grant notification may comprise the aforementioned session ticket. The session ticket is analogous to a cookie that indexes the context of the group session at the application server . The session ticket may comprise an application layer identifier used by the to identify one or more of a session the users associated with the session related data or a combination thereof.

At session reservation data is sent to the proxy UE in accordance with any suitable communications method e.g. via D2D data traffic link etc. . In one possible scenario the session reservation data comprises the internet protocol address and port of the application server acquired by handover UE via the aforementioned domain name server. In another possible scenario this information is pre provisioned to both the handover UE and the proxy UE and the session reservation data need not contain it. The session reservation data may also comprise the aforementioned session ticket thereby facilitating communication between the proxy UE and the application server .

At the proxy UE connects to the application server and transmits a session setup request . The session setup request may be sent in accordance with any suitable communications method e.g. via uplink etc. . The session setup request may comprise or allude to the aforementioned session ticket. Additionally or alternatively the session setup request may comprise one or more of a session ID e.g. a group uniform resource identifier URI a user identifier e.g. a phone number or a combination thereof. At the application server acknowledges that the session setup request has been received in an acknowledgement . At the handover UE completes handover to the non LTE coverage area . In one possible scenario handover is completed in accordance with a system selection procedure. Additionally or alternatively the handover UE may wait for an acknowledgement from one or more of proxy UE and or application server that for example the session reservation data has been received by the proxy UE or that the session has been set up. In another possible scenario handover completion is omitted.

At session context is established between an application server e.g. application server etc. and the handover UE . At session context is established between an application server and the proxy UE . Handover UE session context establishment and proxy UE session context establishment may occur in the order depicted in simultaneously or in the reverse of the order depicted in . In order to establish session context the application server exchanges session context data with the handover UE and the proxy UE . The session context data may comprise any data that enables D2D data traffic relay between the proxy UE and the handover UE as shown at and of . For example the session context data may include data that identifies the session ticket and the corresponding LTE D group. The session context data may indicate one or more of the type of session e.g. voice non voice the users in the LTE D group or group session the session identifier associated with the session e.g. a group URI or a combination thereof.

At P2P group session communication from the LTE coverage area is forwarded from the proxy UE to the application server in accordance with any suitable communications method. The P2P group session communication may originate at the proxy UE or it may be collected by the proxy UE from other UEs within the LTE coverage area in particular other UEs within the LTE D group for example UE . In some scenarios to generate the P2P group session communication the proxy UE combines multiple real time media streams generated by multiple separate members of the LTE D group . The P2P group session communication may be sent along the fourth link third link and second link depicted in . Alternatively the P2P group session communication is sent along the uplink and second link depicted in .

At P2P group session communication is forwarded from the application server to the handover UE in accordance with any suitable communications method. In one possible scenario the P2P group session communication is sent along the first link depicted in and . The P2P group session communication may consist of the P2P group session communication . Additionally or alternatively the P2P group session communication may comprise additional D2D data traffic. For example if there is an additional handover UE similar to handover UE that is a UE that has exited the LTE coverage area and entered either non LTE coverage area or a similar non LTE coverage area then the application server may form the P2P group session communication by combining the P2P group session communication received from the proxy UE proxy UE with the additional D2D data traffic from the additional handover UE. The handover UE would therefore remain in communication with not only the members of the LTE D group that remain in the LTE coverage area but also other handover UEs that have exited the LTE coverage area . The application server may also serve as a buffer under certain circumstances for example if the handover UE has exited the LTE coverage area but not yet connected to the application server via the non LTE coverage area .

At P2P group session communication is sent from the handover UE to the application server in accordance with any suitable communications method. The P2P group session communication originates at the handover UE . In one possible scenario the P2P group session communication is sent to the application server along the first link depicted in and .

At P2P group session communication is forwarded from the application server to the proxy UE in accordance with any suitable communications method. In one possible scenario the P2P group session communication is sent back to the proxy UE along the second link third link and fourth link depicted in . Alternatively the P2P group session communication is sent back along the second link and uplink depicted in . Once again the P2P group session communication may consist solely of the P2P group session communication sent by the handover UE . Additionally or alternatively the P2P group session communication may comprise additional D2D data traffic originating from similarly situated handover UEs.

At the proxy UE distributes P2P group session communication among the members of the LTE D group that remain within the LTE coverage area for example UE in accordance with any suitable communications method. In one possible scenario the P2P group session communication is distributed along the D2D data traffic link depicted in and . In another possible scenario the P2P group session communication is distributed along the D2D data traffic link and the D2D data traffic link depicted in . The P2P group session communication may consist of the P2P group session communication received from the handover UE via the application server . Additionally or alternatively the P2P group session communication may comprise additional D2D data traffic originating at the proxy UE itself.

P2P group session communication may further include collection by the proxy UE of D2D data traffic originating with the members of the LTE D group that remain within the LTE coverage area for example UE . Once collected the data can be forwarded to the handover UE as set forth above at and at . The cycle may continue indefinitely.

At the forwarding of P2P group session communication may be responsive to any number of suitable triggers for example the generation by proxy UE of new data for P2P group session communication or the receipt of such data from the members of the LTE D group that remain within the LTE coverage area for example UE . At the forwarding by handover UE of P2P group session communication may be responsive to analogous triggers. Application server may forward P2P group session communication or P2P group session communication in response to receipt of P2P group session communication or P2P group session communication respectively. Additionally or alternatively the operations disclosed at through may occur intermittently or according to a set schedule originating from proxy UE application server handover UE or any combination thereof.
