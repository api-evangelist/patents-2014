title: Heap data management for limited local memory(LLM) multi-core processors
abstract: A compiler tool-chain may automatically compile an application to execute on a limited local memory (LLM) multi-core processor by including automated heap management transparently to the application. Management of the heap in the LLM for the application may include identifying access attempts to a program variable, transferring the program variable to the LLM, when not already present in the LLM, and returning a local address for the program variable to the application. The application then accesses the program variable using the local address transparently without knowledge about data in the LLM. Thus, the application may execute on a LLM multi-core processor as if the LLM multi-core processor has an unlimited heap space.

This application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 757 272 to Ke Bai et al. filed on Jan. 28 2013 and entitled Heap Data Management for Limited Local Memory LLM Multi Core Processors which is hereby incorporated by reference.

This invention was made with government support under 0916652 awarded by the National Science Foundation. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The instant disclosure relates to data management. More specifically this disclosure relates to data management for multi core processors.

Processors are now transitioning from multi core e.g. few cores to many core e.g. hundreds of cores . In particular many core processors are finding specialized applications where processing on large chunks of data can be carried out in a massively parallel configuration. Scaling a memory architecture to accommodate many core processing systems can be challenging. Further maintaining an appearance of a single unified memory architecture when multiple memory subsystems are involved may be expensive. One problem that contributes to the expense is that the power and performance overheads of automatic memory management in hardware such as caches is becoming prohibitive. Caches consume about half of the processor energy on a single core processor and consume an even larger fraction in multi core and many core processors. Another problem that contributes to the expense is that cache coherency protocols do not scale well to hundreds and thousands of cores.

One conventional solution to improve memory systems in many core processing systems is the use of limited local memory LLM architectures. is a block diagram illustrating a conventional limited local memory LLM architecture. One example of an LLM architecture such as shown in is the IBM Cell Broadband Engine. An LLM architecture may include a 9 core processor with one main core the Power Processing Element or PPE and eight execution cores the Synergistic Processing Elements or SPEs . The main core in the cell processor may be a two way simultaneous multi threaded core and each of the execution cores may work on only one thread at a time in a non pre emptive fashion. The main core may execute the operating system and the main core may have direct access to the global memory through a coherent L2 cache while each execution core may have a local store memory having for example 256 KB of available space. Data communications between the local memory on the execution core and the global memory may be explicitly managed in the software through direct memory access DMA engine . The DMA engine may have access to an interconnect bus with a 128 byte width up to or more than 300 GB s capacity and or have a 100 deep request queue.

In an LLM architecture each core of a many core processor has a small local memory. Each core has access to only the small memory but transfers between local and global memory have to be explicitly specified in the application code. The explicit transfer requirement presents challenges to developing application for many core processors with LLM. One challenge is for applications to be rewritten in a parallelized fashion to operate on the many core processor. A second challenge is to efficiently execute the application in a threaded manner with the limited memory. The application and the data accessed by the application is stored in and executed within the limited memory available. Heap data in particular is dynamic in nature and may not be known at compile time increasing the difficulty of writing application for the limited memory. Heap data may overwrite stack data inadvertently during execution and cause program failures such as an application crash entering an infinite loop or generating an incorrect result.

Programming on an LLM architecture such as shown in may be based on a message passing interface MPI style thread model. A main controller thread creates and distributes data and tasks and may also collect results from the execution threads. The main thread runs on the main core while the execution threads are scheduled on the execution cores. A very simple application in this multicore programming paradigm is illustrated in . is pseudocode for programming an LLM architecture such as . In the pseudocode the main thread executing on the main core initiates several execution threads on the execution cores. In the execution core thread student data structures are initialized and operated on. The student data structure contains two fields id int and score float for each student.

Normally the local memory on the execution core is divided into three segments by the software the text region program code and data heap variable region and stack variable region. The text region is where the compiled code of the program itself resides. The function frames reside in the stack space which starts from the top of the memory growing downwards while the heap variables defined through a malloc command are allocated in the heap region starting from the top of the code region and growing upwards. The three segments share the local store and because the local store is a constrained resource and lacks any hardware protection heap data can easily overflow into the stack region and corrupt the program state.

In the pseudocode of for small values of N the program will execute fine but large values of N may cause catastrophic failures. However even worse is when output is just subtly incorrect. One way to avoid these problems is to avoid using heap variables. However this approach is very limiting on both the creativity and productivity of the programmer.

One conventional method of managing heap data in local memory in an LLM processor is through the use of software cache. is source code illustrating managing heap data of an application such as shown in through a software cache. A software cache is a semi automatic way to manage large amounts of data in a constant amount of local memory space. A software cache data structure may be located in the execution core with a predetermined size in the global data segment. To use software cache an application may include a declaration to manage certain data structure through software cache and the application may then replace every access of that data by a read write from the software cache. Software cache access first checks whether the data is in the cache data structure on the local memory or not. If it is then the program can directly read write the data from to the cache otherwise a direct memory access DMA is performed to retrieve the required data from the global memory and store the data in the local memory where it can be accessed. As new data comes in the cache data structure older data may be evicted out to the main memory.

In the example shown in the execution thread core SPE sends the size of malloc to the main thread core PPE through a mailbox. The main thread core PPE allocates space for the student data structure in the global memory and sends its address back to the execution thread core SPE . The execution core SPE uses this address to access the student data structure that actually resides in the global memory through software cache. To enable this scheme a new thread on the main core PPE heapManage may be initiated which waits for requests from the execution thread core SPE allocates the requested data structure in global memory heap and sends back the allocated address to the execution thread core SPE . Similar steps are taken when free ing up the allocated memory but are skipped for simplicity in the example.

One complexity with the software caching of heap data is that the interface of the software cache requires that the data should be allocated on main core and the execution cores must access the data using the global address. To use software cache if an execution thread core allocates frees certain variables using malloc free then these allocation requests must be transmitted to the main core. Users have to program this communication and allocation free manually. In addition to enable that main core handle the execution thread memory management requests users have to manually create a new thread which will wait and serve requests from execution threads. Normally the execution cores do the bidding of the main core but to support this heap management the main core serves the execution core requests. This reversal of roles makes this programming non intuitive and complicated.

A second complexity with software caching of heap data is that the software cache library only supports one data type in a cache. Software cache does not support for example both an integer element and a pointer element and it must be renamed as any other non structure and non pointer data type. This has to be done because the weight is int and should be changed to integer for the purpose that the two element can use one cache instead of two different caches. This is un natural for C programming and severely reduces readability.

A third complexity with software caching of heap data is that even if the data is in the cache we still need to use cache functions cache rd and cache wr to access data from software cache. The programmer cannot avoid looking up and therefore there is little scope for optimization on the management overhead.

Software cache is best suited to handling global data which is declared and allocated once. Because heap data is allocated dynamically software caching of heap data is inefficient. Software caching of heap data would require changes in application coding and changing the thread on the main core of the many core processor system. Further software caching is difficult to implement and debug as the number of processors increases. What is needed is a scheme that limited local memory LLM multi core programmers and applications can use to efficiently and intuitively manage heap memory of the application.

Heap data management may be handled to reduce complexity to the programmer reduce complexity in the application and or to improve performance of the application. In one embodiment the additional complexity in managing heap memory in a limited space on the local memory may be concealed in a library to minimize changes in the application written for the LLM architecture. For example programmers do not need to worry about the data type for their heap variables. In certain embodiments a user may not write an extra thread on the main core e.g. PPE on the IBM Cell processor for heap data management. In fact the main thread may not change at all. Programmers do not need to consider the redistribution of heap data. The programmers can continue to program as if each execution core has enough memory to manage nearly unlimited heap data. In one embodiment a program may include the functions p2s and s2p before and after any access to a heap variable to allow access to the heap. These modifications are a subset of managing heap data through a software cache do not change the structure of a multi threaded program and are easy for the programmer. Through these functions the global address and local address may be exposed to programmers.

In another embodiment a compiler may automatically insert the library calls without additional coding in the program. The heap management may be built into compiler tool chains to remove programming overhead when compiling applications for limited local memory LLM processors. Further the compiler may perform analysis to provide hints to programmers implementing efficient code for the respective target architecture.

According to one embodiment a method includes executing an application on an execution processor having access to a limited local memory. The method also includes managing heap data in the limited local memory. The step of managing may include receiving an access attempt to a program variable at a global address loading the program variable at the global address in a global memory to the limited local memory and returning a local address for the program variable to the application.

According to another embodiment a computer program product includes a non transitory computer readable medium comprising code to execute the steps comprising executing an application on an execution processor having access to a limited local memory and managing heap data in the limited local memory. Managing the heap data may include the steps of receiving an access attempt to a program variable at a global address loading the program variable at the global address in a global memory to the limited local memory and returning a local address for the program variable to the application.

According to yet another embodiment an apparatus may include a local limited memory a global memory and a processor coupled to the local limited memory and to the global memory. The processor is configured to execute the steps comprising executing an application on an execution processor having access to a limited local memory and managing heap data in the limited local memory. Managing the heap data may include receiving an access attempt to a program variable at a global address loading the program variable at the global address in a global memory to the limited local memory and returning a local address for the program variable to the application.

According to one embodiment a method may include traversing a plurality of statements in a basic block of an application determining whether a statement of the plurality of statements includes a memory reference and when the statement includes a memory references inserting a translation statement before the statement.

According to another embodiment a computer program product may include a non transitory computer readable medium having code to execute certain steps. The steps may include traversing a plurality of statements in a basic block of an application determining whether a statement of the plurality of statements includes a memory reference and when the statement includes a memory references inserting a translation statement before the statement.

According to yet another embodiment an apparatus may include a memory and a processor coupled to the memory. The processor may be configured to execute certain steps including traversing a plurality of statements in a basic block of an application determining whether a statement of the plurality of statements includes a memory reference and when the statement includes a memory references inserting a translation statement before the statement.

The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of the present invention in order that the detailed description of the invention that follows may be better understood. Additional features and advantages of the invention will be described hereinafter that form the subject of the claims of the invention. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the conception and specific embodiment disclosed may be readily utilized as a basis for modifying or designing other structures for carrying out the same purposes of the present invention. It should also be realized by those skilled in the art that such equivalent constructions do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. The novel features that are believed to be characteristic of the invention both as to its organization and method of operation together with further objects and advantages will be better understood from the following description when considered in connection with the accompanying figures. It is to be expressly understood however that each of the figures is provided for the purpose of illustration and description only and is not intended as a definition of the limits of the present invention.

The steps of blocks and may be hidden in a library accessible by the application. Thus programmers do not need to worry about the data type for their heap variables. is source code illustrating an approach to manage heap data according to one embodiment of the disclosure. In one embodiment the heap may be declared and allocated free ed on the execution thread core SPE . Thus a separate thread on the main core PPE for heap data management may be avoided and there may be little or no change to the main core thread to support the heap data management. Programmers may minimize consideration or avoid consideration of the redistribution of heap data such that the applications may continue to execute as if each execution core has enough memory to manage a nearly unlimited heap data. The application may include the functions p2s and s2p before and or after any access to a heap variable. These modifications may be a subset of functions for managing heap data through software cache do not change the structure of a multi threaded program and are easy for the programmer. The library then exposes the global address and local address to the application.

A program variable may have two addresses in the Limited Local Memory LLM architecture depending on the memory in which it is located and unlike in cache based architectures the program must access the variables by correct address. A conventional software cache implementation hides the address of the variable in the local memory and exposes only the global address of the variable. While this keeps programming very much like that in cache based architectures it requires address translation each time the variable is accessed and results in high overhead.

The heap management illustrated in exposes the local address of the variable to the application so that the application can access it directly and not perform the address translation every time. A function p2s global address ga brings the program variable at global address ga to the local memory if it is not already there and returns the local address la of the variable. The counterpart functionality is encapsulated in the function s2p local address la . In addition to these two new implemented functions an application programming interface API for heap data management in certain embodiments may redefine two existing functions. If there is enough memory space in the heap region defined in the local store the malloc function returns a pointer to it otherwise it evicts older heap variable s to global memory to make sufficient space for this heap variable and returns a pointer to it. The malloc function may allocate space on the local memory and returns the global memory address of the allocated heap variable. This is so that the global address may be used to access the heap variables including when writing them in data structures e.g. linked list. Arbitrary sized linked lists cannot work with local addresses of heap variables. A free function may also receive and operate on the global address of the variable.

The heap data and the heap management table in the main memory may be managed dynamically which may allow support for nearly unlimited heap memory. In one embodiment a separate memory management thread may be running on the main core. This separate thread may be a part of the library and the programmer does not have to explicitly code it. The unit of data transfer between the local memory and the global memory is called the granularity of management. Heap data may be managed at various granularities from word level to the whole heap space allocated in the local memory.

Considering the SPU code in the program allocates a student data structure and then accesses one field student.id . When the program accesses any part of a allocated data structure if the whole data structure is brought into the local memory then the heap management is done at programmer defined granularity. If only an exact field such as the integer field of student.id is brought into the local memory then the heap management is being done at word level of granularity. A finer granularity of heap management may be beneficial if the allocated data structures are large and only a small part of them are used in the algorithm. Finally heap management may be performed at a coarse granularity by grouping the allocated objects in a block and if a part of any of them is accessed then a whole block of them are brought into the local memory. This may be effective when the allocated objects are small. One advantage of a software implemented heap management is that it can be tuned to the application demands rather than block size being fixed for a given processor implementation as in traditional cache architectures.

To assist in managing a nearly unlimited heap data in a limited space on the local memory the library may keep a mapping of global to local addresses. This data structure is called the heap management table. The local memory space for heap management S may be divided into a constant space required for heap data H and a constant space required for heap management table T such that S H T. A malloc may add an entry to this table and a free may result in the removal of an entry in the heap management table. The table may be accessed at every call to p2s and s2p functions. A part of this table may be stored in the local memory. All the sizes S H and T are fixed at compile time. When an entry is added the heap management may check if there is place to write the new entry. If yes then the new entry may be written to the table. Otherwise the new entry may be written to the table after making space for a new entry by evicting some of the older entries to the main memory. The number of entries evicted at a time is the granularity of management and the heap table management may be performed at several granularities from a single element to the entire table size. In one embodiment the heap management table may be managed at the whole table size granularity. Thus the whole table may be evicted and a full table brought back into the local memory.

The heap data structures and the heap management table may be implemented in the main global memory using dynamic data structures. The malloc function may be mapped to insert operation in the dynamic data structure on the main core through communication between the local and the main thread which can interpret messages from the local thread and translate them as inserts in the data structure in the main thread. In a many core processor this may be achieved through another thread on the main processor and a mailbox based communication between the execution cores and the main core. This communication may be in addition to the actual heap data that has to be transferred between the local and the main core.

In embedded systems it may be possible to define an upper bound on the heap memory. Thus overhead in managing the table may be reduced. If a maximum heap size e.g. assuming no free s is known at compile time profiling may be used to keep this size. Then the heap data structure and heap management table may be declared as static data structures and all heap variables may be allocated contiguously in the pre defined space. When heap data is needed the address may be resolved in the execution core to allow a direct memory access DMA to transfer the data between the local and the global memory. In this embodiment no extra thread is executed in the main core. Furthermore in certain embodiments the whole heap management table may be housed in the local memory which may result in improved performance.

For certain embedded applications where the maximum heap size of the application or thread is available by profiling the application runtime may be improved by allocating sufficient space in the global memory such that dynamic allocation of memory in the PPE is reduced or eliminated. This may further improve performance because dynamic memory allocation in the PPE requires communication between the SPE and the PPE through a mailbox which may be slower than a direct memory access. Performance may also be improved by increasing the heap space in the local store to as high as possible and or increasing the granularity also helps.

Performance with heap management as disclosed in this application is illustrated by line of . As shown the technique does not have a restriction on the heap size of the application up to at least 100 000 nodes. Both the heap management table and memory allocation in the global memory may be dynamically managed. In some cases the runtime increases with the management scheme because DMA is performed for the management of the heap data and heap management table.

As the number of cores in a processor is scaled up scaling the memory architecture becomes a bottleneck. Limited local memory LLM architectures are a scalable memory architecture platform that is now popular in embedded processors. Such processors feature a software controlled local memory in each core. Automated heap memory management may be achieved by providing an simple to use programming interface which consists of a redefinition of the malloc and free commands and introducing two new functions p2s and s2p which are called in an application before and after every heap pointer access. The active heap management disclosed above may be executed on for example the SONY PLAYSTATION 3 and the IBM CELL processor. The heap management may support any amount of heap data is intuitive and easy to use and scales well with number of cores. In certain embodiments a single memory management thread on the PPE may service the needs of all the SPE memory requests.

According to one embodiment the number of table entries may be the same as the number of heap objects in the local store of SPE. For example for a given total space for heap variables the space may be partitioned to heap management table and heap variables to optimize the total DMA transfer between global memory and local store. According to another embodiment the calls to p2s and s2p functions before after each heap variable access may be reduced by predicting if the variable will need frequent access again at a later stage. This can be improved further by doing a flow analysis using the control flow graph. According to yet another embodiment prefetching and double buffering may be used to reduce the runtime needed for the DMA.

Heap data may also be managed through modifications to a compiler. An automated and low overhead heap data management scheme may be implemented in an application through a compiler and a runtime library. The modified compiler may reduce library call insertions in the application. The runtime library may include heap management functions such as for example  malloc size Jree global addr and g2l global addr . The  malloc function may allocate space in global memory and return a global address to that space. A global address may be returned when the mapping relation between global address and local address is many to one. A  free function may receive a global address and deallocate space in the global memory corresponding to the global address. A g2l global addr function may retrieve a global  addr and looks it up in a heap management data structure. If the heap object pointed to by global addr is not in the local memory the g21 function may fetch it from the specified global addr and place it in the data structure. Either case may return the local address in our data structure.

According to one embodiment extensions to the compiler may be implemented in GCC 4.1.1. For example the compiler support may be implemented as a pass at the GIMPLE level because GIMPLE is a language independent IR and contains high level information e.g. pointer information. GIMPLE is a three address IR with tuples of no more than 3 operands with some exceptions like function calls and obtained by removing language specific construct from AST Abstract Syntax Tree .

Additional details regarding an algorithm for a compiler to insert statements for heap data management is shown in . is source code illustrating insertion of heap data management statements during compilation of a program according to one embodiment of the disclosure. As shown in the embodiment of a pass traverses statements in basic blocks of the application. When a memory reference is detected at line a analyzeStmt function may insert a g21 function call. In an embodiment using GIMPLE modification expressions may be represented in the form a b and only one of them may be a reference thus the analyzeStmt function may check if either one is a reference. If a reference is found the pass creates a statement T  g2l ptr where ptr may be 1 or r and inserts the statement into the statement list before stmt.

In one embodiment when the g21 function receives a parameter the function may check whether the parameter is in local address space or global address space. If the parameter is a local address such as a stack pointer the function may return the original address. In some embodiments the heap object may contain a function pointer as an element. For example with a statement such as H func testFunc the compiler may use H as the parameter for the  g21 function instead of H func where func is a function pointer in the heap object H.

In one embodiment the compiler may be designed to handle multi level points. Multi level pointers such as in C program code may be broken down to operations containing only single level pointers in GIMPLE IR with artificial pointers generated by the compiler. In one example a pointer read statement may be transformed to two statements in the GIMPLE IR with an artificial pointer D.2348 generated by compiler. For example a C statement of val ptr may be transformed to two GIMPLE IR statements of D.2348 ptr and val D.2348. By this transformation resulting statements in the GIMPLE IR have single level references. Although D.2348 and ptr are both pointers macro TREE CODE of them return var decl for D.2348 but indirect ref for the latter one. Thus in one embodiment library calls may only be added for the ptr reference. After address translation D.2348 receives a local address and no further function call is added. The TREE CODE macro described above may be a functionality provided by GCC which can tell what kind of node a particular tree is.

The heap cache may also include a victim buffer in the local memory. The victim buffer may be used to relieve the thrashing of heap objects. For example when a decision is made to swap a heap object out of the heap data region the data will not immediately be moved to global memory but instead to the victim buffer . When there is a heap miss in the heap cache the heap object may be found in the victim buffer reducing or eliminating the need for performing slow fetch operations from global memory.

An implementation of the g21 function may be described with reference to the heap cache illustrated in . At step the g21 function may receive a global addr and the hash function may return a set index i corresponding to the requested global address global addr. At step after finding the set number i the hash function may access entry i in the HMT where a tag status for the set i may be stored. Then the valid tags in the selected set are compared to a tag in the global address global addr. At step after comparison the hash function may determine in which block the accessing heap object is located. The hash function may further determine an object offset of the accessing heap object in the cache block from global addr. In the example illustrated in the offset is 1. The g21 function may also check the status of the accessing object in the entry i of HMT to determine whether it is in the location b. If there is a valid matching entry in HMT then the request is a hit and the local address may be calculated by adding the object offset to the local address of the heap block that corresponds to the matching entry. If not then the request is a miss and a miss handler is invoked at step . The miss handler may search the victim buffer which may be fully associative to determine whether the requested heap object is present. When the heap object hits a local address in the block of the victim buffer may be returned. Otherwise an old heap block following a predefined replacement policy will be selected and evicted out from the heap data region to the victim buffer to free space for the requested data at step . Before overwriting a heap block in the victim buffer the modified bit of the block may be checked. If this block is marked dirty the block may be written back to the global memory. Otherwise the location is overwritten at step . Then the heap block that corresponds to the requested global address from global memory may be fetched and placed in the evicted location.

In one embodiment the heap data structure management may be enhanced with Single Instruction Multiple Data SIMD operations. As described above the runtime library for the heap cache may provide an N way e.g. N 1 2 4 8 associative heap cache. The tag comparisons for the implementation of the N way associative heap cache may be performed in parallel with the Single Instruction Multiple Data SIMD comparison instruction when the execution core e.g. SPE supports Single Instruction Multiple Data SIMD . In one embodiment this SIMD programming may operates on vector data types that are 128 bits 16 bytes long. In one example an entry in the HMT may be one word long and four comparisons for a set in four way associative heap cache may be performed in one SIMD instruction. In another example an eight way associative heap cache may use two SIMD instructions for the eight comparisons of a set.

In one embodiment a round robin replacement policy may be implemented in the heap cache. When it is determined that a new heap block is to be brought into the N way associative heap cache an old block may be chosen to be evicted from the heap cache in a round robin fashion. In one example a counter may be maintained for each set of the heap cache. The count indicates the index of the next block of the set to be evicted. When a heap block is evicted the counter may be updated by adding one and then modulo the number of blocks in the set such as four for a four way associative heap cache.

Heap caches such as when implemented as described in the embodiments above through a common run library and compiler modifications provide an improvement in performance of the applications being compiled. is a graph illustrating runtime performance of application with and without compiler inserted heap data management statements according to one embodiment of the disclosure. The metrics shown in are obtained using benchmarks with a 4 way associative heap region without victim buffer. An average improvement of 43 is obtained across all benchmarks.
