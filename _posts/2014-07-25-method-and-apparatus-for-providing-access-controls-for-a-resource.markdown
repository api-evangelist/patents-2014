title: Method and apparatus for providing access controls for a resource
abstract: An approach is provided for enabling a subscriber to establish rules for controlling user interaction with a resource based on the activity of the user. A reactive control platform monitors a current activity of a user of a device, one or more services, or a combination thereof associated with a subscriber during access by the user to a network of a subscriber. The status of the user is determined based on the monitoring, profile information associated with the user, or a combination thereof. A request for input from the subscriber for specifying one or more rules to be enforced for affecting a use of the device, the one or more services, the network of the subscriber, or a combination thereof by the user is then generated based on the determination.

With the growing popularity of computers interactive electronic communications and on demand media consumers now have access to a wealth of entertainment information retrieval and communication services. For example many consumers take advantage of broadband based audio and video services which they can access via their mobile devices computers or set top boxes STBs . These services and devices enable users to perform activities such as record content queue television programs play video games perform video conferencing access the Internet etc. Typically the subscriber to the service can configure one or more settings or controls e.g. parental controls for controlling how other users access these services or devices. Unfortunately these settings must be established in advance to be effective and the process for establishing the settings can be cumbersome.

Therefore there is a need for an approach to enable a subscriber to establish rules for controlling user interaction with a resource based on the activity of the user.

A preferred apparatus method and software for enabling a subscriber to establish rules for controlling user interaction with a resource based on the activity of the user is described. In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the preferred embodiments of the invention. It is apparent however that the preferred embodiments may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the preferred embodiments of the invention.

Although various exemplary embodiments are described with respect to a content processing device such as a set top box STB it is contemplated these embodiments have applicability to any device or system requiring usage permissions to be granted for facilitating a level of usage or access to said device or system. This may include for example a home communication terminal HCT a digital home communication terminal DHCT a stand alone personal video recorder PVR a television set a digital video disc DVD player a video enabled phone an audio video enabled personal digital assistant PDA a personal computer PC as well as other like technologies and customer premises equipment CPE . It is further noted that the exemplary embodiments herein may also have applicability to security systems gated entry or doorway systems intelligent vehicle system network based applications or services or the like.

As mentioned previously the above described resources e.g. content processing device may execute services for streaming media and audio content accessing files facilitating social networking etc. The devices may access these services by way of applications which may be configured to perform one or more network tasks. In some instances the network connectivity for accessing these services as offered by providers is provided by a local area network LAN configured for a premise . By way of the LAN multiple different users may operate the devices and or in order to access the services . In addition to interacting directly with the devices via the LAN the users may also connect their tablets smartphones or other mobile devices to the LAN of the premise or alternatively with the other devices e.g. the set top box . Access to the LAN may be granted to the users based on a simple password authentication procedure.

Typically a subscriber responsible for providing the LAN may configure usage controls for affecting the ability of other users within the premise to access and or use the LAN the different services capable of being accessed by respective devices and or a combination thereof. For example parental controls may be established for preventing younger users from accessing broadband movies via a set top box that are known to contain violence sexually explicit scenes profanity etc. As another example a restaurant owner may limit access to a LAN of the business to 30 minutes for regular patrons during lunch hours while having no such restrictions for premium customers. Various other controls may be established in advance by the subscriber as a way of preempting anticipating limiting or denying usage of the LAN or the different services or devices and .

Unfortunately setting up the controls for these resources can be a cumbersome process for the subscriber. In addition given the vast array of services available to the different users having access to the LAN e.g. the members of a household customizing the controls can require much time and effort. For this reason many subscribers avoid establishing the controls altogether. There is currently no convenient means for enabling a subscriber to establish such controls in response to real time actions performed by one or more users. In addition there is currently no mechanism for enabling the automatic generation of rules controls based on the actions performed by users over time.

To address this issue system of presents a reactive control platform configured to initiate the generation of controls or rules regarding one or more users of one or more resources of a subscriber. In one embodiment the reactive control platform generates rules for impacting the extent of use or access of a resource in response to real time actions performed by users as they interact with them. For the purpose of illustration herein the rules may be executed as one or more customizable controls at the device and or service and may include one or more conditions criteria instructions or the like.

Also as noted previously the resources that are to be subject to the one or more rules may include any devices e.g. content processing device or services e.g. those of service providers of the premise capable of operating over the LAN of the subscriber. As such the rules may apply to the resources as they are employed within the premise . The rules may also be enforced in the case where the wireless network range of the LAN extends beyond the premise . For the purpose of illustration herein the rules may be applied and or enforced with respect to any of the client devices that access the network the network components e.g. routers hubs that enable the LAN or a combination thereof. Hence the reactive control platform detects an action executed by a user with respect to any connected resource.

In one embodiment the reactive control platform monitors the activities of users as they interact with the resources of the premise . By way of example in the case where a user at the premise activates the set top box selects movie content changes the channel initiates a recording etc. all of these activities are detected by the reactive control platform . As another example when a user of a mobile device that is connected to an in home wireless network of the subscriber attempts to access a streaming media service download news content access a video conference service or the like these activities are also detected. Hence the execution of the platform is triggered by real time performance of an activity of a user. The reactive control platform persistently monitors the real time activities of any user device or service that accesses the LAN via router device not shown .

In one embodiment the reactive control platform determines a status of the user that performs the real time action as monitored. The status may indicate whether the user is a first time or previous user of the service e.g. per service providers the device e.g. STB user device or the network. By way of example the status of the user may be identified by determining whether the user responsible for performing the triggering action is associated with existing profile information maintained by database . The profile information may be generated during an initial registration or accessing of the device or service by a user and may include for example user name information identifier information device identifier information biometric information or the like.

As another example the platform may also determine whether any rules have been previously established for the user or if a previous history of activity is associated with the user. In the case where existing profile information rules or activity information exists for the user the reactive control platform determines the user is a previous user of the device or service from which the activity was initiated. Per this execution the identity of the user may be determined accordingly and associated with a specific identifier name information avatar etc. In the case where no existing profile information rules or activity information exists for the user the platform determines the user is a new user of the device or service from which the activity was initiated. Per this execution the identity of the user may be deemed unknown to the subscriber.

In one embodiment the reactive control platform may also process context information associated with the user the device e.g. STB or computer or a combination thereof as a means of further determining the status of the user. It is noted that by identifying the status of the user the reactive control platform may support the real time generating of profile information and associated rules for new users. In addition the platform may support the updating and or adapting of profile information and associated rules for existing users. In either case the generating or updating of the profile information is performed in response to an action of a user of a device or service operated via the LAN of the subscriber. This is in contrast to traditional approaches for generating profile information and associated rules wherein each user profile must be configured in advance. It is contemplated in certain embodiments that login or authentication information for enabling access of the user or a device of the user to the LAN may also be processed for determining a status of the user.

In one embodiment the reactive control platform generates a request for input from the subscriber for specifying rules to be associated with the user based on their determined status. Per this approach the input may specify a response of the subscriber to a current action e.g. real time of a user as they interact with a resources of the premise . By way of example the request is sent as an input message to a device of the subscriber i.e. a mobile device wherein the message requires direct feedback from the subscriber. In certain implementations the continued action of the user with respect to the resource e.g. STB may be halted or postponed pending a response from the subscriber. Alternatively the activity being engaged by the user with respect to a resource may continue normally. In the latter scenario the normal operation or activity of the resource may change depending on the rules specified by the user.

The request sent to the subscriber may indicate the status of the user in question. This may include for example the identity of the user along with details for indicating they are a first time or previous user of a given device or service associated with the subscriber. In addition the request may indicate the specific device or service the user is interacting with at the moment along with the current activity of the user. For example the request may indicate a user is attempting to join in a collaborative video gaming session using the video game console in the living room entitled Family Game System. Still further the request may specify one or more additional details metadata regarding the resource being used including category information type information or the like pertaining to the device or service. For example in the case where a user attempts to access a pay per view movie the request message may indicate the name of the movie the associated genre category the associated parental advisory rating e.g. G PG 13 R NC 17 the movie description the content provider e.g. the name of the broadcast or service provider or other details. It is noted that presentment of this information per the request enables the subscriber to more readily evaluate the user activity and decide upon one or more rules to submit as input for responding to said activity.

In one embodiment the request may further indicate one or more subscriber selection or input options for specifying rules to be associated with a user in response to their interaction with a resource. As noted previously the input may indicate various conditions criteria instructions or the like which when established impact the current or subsequent interaction of the user with the resource. By way of example the request message may indicate an option to be received as input for allowing the action of the user denying the action of the user or restricting the action of the user. Allowance of the action corresponds to subscriber acceptance of the activity of the user i.e. continued usage of the LAN to view of a movie. In contrast denial of the action corresponds to lack of acceptance of the subscriber of the activity being engaged by the user. In the case where the subscriber opts to restrict the action this corresponds to acceptance of the action based on one or more conditions. The reactive control platform enables the presentment of a configuration interface for enabling the subscriber to establish the restrictions.

By way of example the restricting may include limiting the amount of time the user may access the resource or limiting the use to specify type of content or activities. Per this execution when the resource is a computer the time restriction may limit the user to 90 minutes of use or to a particular period of use e.g. 3 pm 5 pm . In addition an activity or content type restriction may be specified for indicating the user is limited to only accessing documents and audio content related to science and mathematics but not movies or streaming media. As another example the restriction may specify a network location content provider channel or the like that the user it to be limited to for further inhibiting their interaction with the resource in question.

It is noted that multiple restrictions may be associated with the user in regards to their determined activity. As such each restriction specified as input by the subscriber serves as a further means of filtering the level of activity of the user with the specified resource. Also of note because the request response procedure is facilitated by way of a mobile device of the subscriber the subscriber may specify rules from any location as long as they have access to a network e.g. service provider network . Under this approach the user is not required to interact directly with the devices or or the services associated with said devices per service providers in order to establish rules controls . Furthermore the user is not required to be physically located within the premise in order to establish rules controls .

In one embodiment the reactive control platform stores the input provided by the user as one or more rules in association with profile information for the user. Once stored the reactive control platform is then able to initiate enforcement of the rules accordingly for impacting the current or subsequent use of the resource at the premise . In the case for example where the status of the user is determined to be new e.g. a first time user of the resource in question a new profile may be generated in association with the user a device of the user or a combination thereof based on the contextual information the monitored activity of the user and any other data regarding the new user. As such the subscriber specified input rules may be stored in association with distinct profile information for the user. In the case for example where the status of the user indicates they are a previous user the existing profile information may be updated to include the specified rules. By way of this approach a prior set of rules related to the same activity device or service may be overwritten or appended in order to reflect the most recent rule set. As will be discussed further later on herein the rules may be subsequently adapted by the reactive control platform automatically i.e. without requesting further input from the subscriber.

It is further noted that activity information may also be stored in association with the profile information for enabling subsequent recall of the actions performed by users with respect to the resource. As such the activity information may be aggregated over time to compile an activity history for the user which may be subsequently analyzed by the platform for determining the status of the user. The activity information may include any data for indicating the specific action performed by the user such as a channel change a content download request a display settings change a device or service activation request e.g. ON OFF a login request a broadcast request an authentication request accessing of an address or online resource etc.

In one embodiment the reactive control platform initiates enforcement of the rules as stored in association with the profile information. The enforcement may correspond to execution of the one or more conditions criteria instructions or the like by the devices or the one or more services per service providers or a combination thereof. Still further the enforcement may correspond to the action of accepting denying or restricting the activity of a user with respect to a given resource of the premise . By way of example the reactive control platform may submit a command to the devices and or one or more services to invoke initiate execution of the rules. The command may be submitted to the specified device or service according to a machine language processing language control schema or the like corresponding to the operating system or device processing system of the resource in question. In certain instances the rules may themselves be generated according to a specific machine language control schema or the like.

In one embodiment the reactive control platform generates a message regarding the enforcement. The context and or content of the message may vary depending on the status of the user or whether the message is intended for the subscriber. By way of example the message may indicate the enforcement action specified by the subscriber in response to the current activity of the user i.e. restricted access to the movie content requested by the user. In addition the message may provide details regarding a specific restriction including established time limits or access limits. It is contemplated in certain embodiments that the enforcement message may also indicate one or more alternative actions available to a user in response to a restriction. For example in the case where the user of a set top box is restricted from accessing R rated movies the platform may indicate that movies rated PG 13 and below are acceptable along with a movie recommendation.

In one embodiment the reactive control platform generates one or more rules automatically based on the determined status of the user and the monitored activities engaged by the user with the resources of the premise over a period of time. Per this approach the subscriber need not provide an input for specifying the one or more rules to be applied with respect to a monitored activity of a user. Rather the platform may intelligently assign and or generate rules to associate with the profile of the user. This may correspond to an automated learning capability of the platform wherein the activity history of the user is observed to identify the resource usage patterns of the user. In addition the subscriber response history may be observed over a period of time for enabling the platform to observe the rules enforced in connection with the user. The platform may be configured to analyze this historic data based on one or more known learning algorithms data generalization approaches data mining techniques or the like. Based on this analysis the platform may generate a behavior model for representing an anticipated response of the subscriber to future actions performed by a specific user as they interact with a resource. In addition the platform may generate a model for representing an anticipated response of the subscriber to the activities of new users i.e. those users with limited or no existing profile information.

By way of example the reactive control platform may observe a tendency of a parent to associate a rule for blocking content that is rated R and above for a child who attempts to access movies from a streaming media service via a tablet device. Per this scenario the platform may initially request an input from the parent for specifying the restriction in response to an attempt by the child to access this content. However in response to a subsequent attempt by the child to access the same type of content from their mobile phone the same blocking rule may be applied by the platform . As another example the platform may apply this rule in response to an attempt by the child to activate a video game featuring adult content and violence. Still further the platform may restrict access to the streaming media service until 7 pm based on a tendency of non use of the service by the child until this time a similar rule established for a sibling online calendar information for indicating standard homework times of the family or a combination thereof. It is noted in the latter example that one or more external data sources may be utilized by the platform for enabling the generation of rules.

In one embodiment a feedback message may also be generated for the subscriber in response to automatic generation of a rule. The feedback message may be presented to the mobile device of the subscriber for indicating the reactive control platform has generated one or more rules in response to a monitored activity of the user with respect to a resource e.g. content processing device . As such the one or more rules may be presented as a recommendation to the subscriber. In addition the feedback message may present one or more user input or selection options for indicating a response of the user to generation of the rules. By way of example the input or selection options may include an acknowledgement of the rules a canceling of the rules an adapting of the rules or a combination thereof. In the case where the subscriber selects to adapt the rules the adapted rules are stored in association with profile information e.g. per database for the user as opposed to the rules generated by the reactive control platform .

It is noted that the above described embodiments enable rules for controlling the use or access of one or more resources of a premise to be generated based on real time interaction by users with said resources. This presents a subscriber that maintains a personal network such as via LAN with several advantages. In one advantage the rules may be developed based on actual use or access of a resource and continually refined thereafter. As such the rules for affecting how users interact with various devices and or or services e.g. per service providers over a LAN may be developed on the fly rather than having to be configured in advance. As another advantage the rules may be customized with respect to different users devices and services thus reducing the time required of the subscriber to establish the necessary access controls. Any system wherein shared access to resources are required may benefit from execution of the system presented herein.

In certain embodiments user devices the reactive control platform the service providers the local area network LAN e.g. per a router device and other elements of system may be configured to communicate via a service provider network . According to certain embodiments one or more networks such as data network telephony network and or wireless network can interact with the service provider network . Networks may be any suitable wireline and or wireless network and be managed by one or more service providers. For example telephony network may include a circuit switched network such as the public switched telephone network PSTN an integrated services digital network ISDN a private branch exchange PBX or other like network.

Networks may employ various technologies for enabling wireless communication including for example code division multiple access CDMA long term evolution LTE enhanced data rates for global evolution EDGE general packet radio service GPRS mobile ad hoc network MANET global system for mobile communications GSM Internet protocol multimedia subsystem IMS universal mobile telecommunications system UMTS etc. as well as any other suitable wireless medium e.g. microwave access WiMAX wireless fidelity WiFi satellite and the like. Meanwhile data network may be any local area network LAN metropolitan area network MAN wide area network WAN the Internet or any other suitable packet switched network such as a commercially owned proprietary packet switched network such as a proprietary cable or fiber optic network.

Still further the communication provider network may embody circuit switched and or packet switched networks that include facilities to provide for transport of circuit switched and or packet based communications. It is further contemplated that networks may include components and facilities to provide for signaling and or bearer communications between the various components or facilities of system . In this manner the communication network may embody or include portions of a signaling system 7 SS7 network Internet protocol multimedia subsystem IMS or other suitable infrastructure to support control and signaling functions.

It is noted though not shown in the figure that in certain embodiments user devices may be configured to establish peer to peer communication sessions with each other using a variety of technologies near field communication NFC Bluetooth ZigBee infrared etc. Also connectivity can be provided via a wireless local area network LAN . By way of example a group of user devices may be configured to a common LAN so that each device can be uniquely identified via any suitable network addressing scheme. For example the LAN may utilize the dynamic host configuration protocol DHCP to dynamically assign private DHCP internet protocol IP addresses to each user device i.e. IP addresses that are accessible to devices connected to the service provider network as facilitated via a router.

In one embodiment an authentication module authenticates users and user devices for interaction with the reactive control platform . By way of example the authentication module receives a request to subscribe to the platform as a subscriber having administrative authority and control. As such the subscriber is able to regulate the activities of other users. The subscription process may include specifying the one or more devices and or services to be regulated and or connected to a local area network LAN . In addition the subscriber may specify the one or more users having permission to access the various devices and or services via the LAN . This may include for example indicating a username user identifier or device identifier. In this case an initial set of profile information may be stored to database accordingly. Under this scenario the profile information is stored devoid of any associated rules.

The authentication process performed by the module may also include receiving and validating a login name and or user identification value as provided or established for a particular user during a subscription or registration process with the service provider. In addition the module may operate in connection with a router associated with the LAN for acquiring a user identification value. The login name and or user identification value may be received as input provided by the user from the user device or other device via a graphical user interface to the platform e.g. as enabled by user interface module . Profile information for respective subscribers or users which contains pertinent user or device data may be cross referenced as part of the login process. Alternatively the login process may be performed through automated association of profile settings with an IP address a carrier detection signal of a user device mobile directory number MDN subscriber identity module SIM e.g. of a SIM card radio frequency identifier RFID tag or other identifier.

In one embodiment the activity detection module is configured to determine the current activity of the user. By way of example the activity detection module monitors the activities of users as they interact with the resources of the premise . This includes operating in connection with the authentication module to determine an identity of the user. In addition the module determines the type of activity performed as well as the device or service associated with the activity. For example the activity detection module determines when a user at the premise activates a set top box selects movie content changes a channel initiates a recording etc.

In one embodiment the user status determination module determines the status of a user based on their interaction with a resource of the user premise . By way of example the user status determination module submits an instruction for the authentication module to retrieve profile information regarding the user that initiated an activity with a resource. In the case where the query is successful the module determines the user is a previous user and further determines any current rules associated with the user. In contrast when the query fails the module determines the user as new and operates with the authentication module to establish initial profile information.

It is noted that the user status determination module may also process context information as gathered per various sensors not shown of the devices of the user premise the one or more user devices or a combination thereof. By way of example the module may process user or device identifier information temporal information relating to the time of occurrence of an activity or any other information useful for identifying the user.

In one embodiment the subscriber validation module operates in connection with the user interface module to generate a request for input from the subscriber for specifying rules to be associated with the user based on their determined status. Per this approach the input may specify a response of the subscriber to a current action e.g. real time of a user as they interact with a resources of the premise . By way of example the request is sent as an input message to a device of the subscriber i.e. a mobile device wherein the message requires direct feedback from the subscriber. The input may include an option to accept deny or restrict the activity of the determined user of a given resource.

In the case where the subscriber opts to restrict the action the subscriber validation module enables presentment of a configuration interface for enabling the subscriber to establish the restrictions. The configuration interface may be generated in connection with the user interface module . As such the subscriber may be presented with options for establishing date or time range restrictions content type restrictions channel restrictions or the like. It is noted that the input provided in response to the request corresponds to the one or more rules to be applied for enforcement with respect to a user.

In one embodiment the profile updating module generates or updates profile information in association with a user that initiated an activity with respect to a resource. This corresponds to a storing of the input rules acquired via the subscriber validation module . By way of example the storing is performed based on the determined status of the user per the user status determination module the response to the request initiated by the subscriber validation module or a combination thereof. In the case for example where the status of the user is determined to be new e.g. a first time user of the resource in question a new profile may be generated in association with the user a device of the user or a combination thereof based on the contextual information the monitored activity of the user and any other data regarding the new user. As such the subscriber specified input rules may be stored in association with distinct profile information for the user.

In the case for example where the status of the user indicates they are a previous user the existing profile information may be updated to include the specified rules. By way of this approach a prior set of rules related to the same activity device or service may be overwritten or appended within the database in order to reflect the most recent rule set. Still further the profile updating module may enable rules to be subsequently adapted by the reactive control platform automatically based on the detection of an action by the same user per the activity detection module .

In one embodiment the action module initiates enforcement of the rules as stored by the profile updating module . By way of example the enforcement may correspond to execution of the one or more conditions criteria instructions or the like by the devices or the one or more services per service providers or a combination thereof. Still further the enforcement may correspond to the action of accepting denying or restricting the activity of a user with respect to a given resource of the premise as initiated per the input requested by the subscriber validation module . The action module may submit a command to the devices and or one or more services to invoke initiate execution of the specified rules as a machine language instruction or other language.

It is noted that the action module may also generate and enforce rules automatically based on analysis of profile information regarding a user. The analysis may include for example determining a pattern or tendency of use of a resource of the premise over time by a user a pattern or history of one or more rules enforced by the subscriber per the user or a combination thereof. Based on this analysis the action module may then generate a rule in response to a subsequent activity of the user. In this case the action module may further operate in connection with the user interface module for generating a feedback message for the subscriber regarding the rule.

In one embodiment the user interface module enables presentment of a graphical user interface for presenting messages regarding the rules or enforcement thereof. In addition the user interface module may enable execution of a configuration interface for allowing the subscriber to customize various restrictions. By way of example the user interface module generates the interface in response to application programming interfaces APIs or other function calls.

In one embodiment a communication module enables formation of a session over a network between the platform and the user devices . By way of example the communication module executes various protocols and data sharing techniques for enabling collaborative execution between a subscriber s user device e.g. mobile devices laptops smartphones tablet computers desktop computers and the reactive control platform over the network .

The above presented modules and components of the reactive control platform can be implemented in hardware firmware software or a combination thereof. Though depicted as a separate entity in it is contemplated that the reactive control platform may be implemented for direct operation by the resources of the premise i.e. routers set top boxes computers. As such the platform may generate direct signal inputs by way of the operating system of the device for interacting with the services of the service providers . In another embodiment one or more of the modules may be implemented for operation by respective user devices e.g. of the subscriber as a platform or combination thereof.

In step of process the reactive control platform monitors a current activity of a user of a device one or more services or a combination thereof associated with a subscriber during access by the user to a network of a subscriber. The current activity may correspond to an action or task of the device or one or more services such as a channel selection content download recording of content etc. In step the platform determines a status of the user based on the monitoring profile information associated with the user or a combination thereof. The status may indicate whether the user is a first time or previous user of the service e.g. per service providers the device e.g. STB user device or the network e.g. LAN .

In another step the reactive control platform generates a request for input from the subscriber for specifying one or more rules to be enforced for affecting a use of the device the one or more services the network of the subscriber or a combination thereof by the user based on the determination. In another step the platform transmits the request to a user device of the subscriber. The request specifies the user the current activity of the user the status of the user or a combination thereof. Under this scenario the input may be provided by the subscriber via a mobile device or other computing device of the subscriber for enabling a real time response to the request.

In step of process the reactive control platform receives the input from the subscriber. In another step the platform stores the one or more rules in association with the user. The one or more rules may include one or more instructions for restricting denying allowing or a combination thereof the use of the device the one or more services the network of the subscriber or a combination thereof. It is noted that the restriction may correspond to a a limited use of the device the one or more services the network of the subscriber or a combination thereof a b conditional use of the device the one or more services the network of the subscriber or a combination thereof or c a combination thereof based on channel information content information a content type a time frame network address information location information activity type information device information user information or a combination thereof.

In another step the reactive control platform generates the profile information based on the status of the user the input or a combination thereof. The storing of the one or more rules in association with the user is based on the generation of the profile. Hence the reactive control platform may build the profile over time as the rules are updated or otherwise adapted based on subsequent attempts by the user to access the device the one or more services the network or a combination thereof.

In step of process the reactive control platform initiates enforcement of the one or more rules based on the input the profile information associated with the user or a combination thereof. In steps and the platform generates an enforcement message based on the status of the user and initiates a presentment of the enforcement message to the device another device associated with the user or a combination thereof respectively. It is noted that the enforcement may correspond to execution of the one or more conditions criteria instructions or the like by the devices or the one or more services per service providers or a combination thereof. Still further the enforcement may correspond to the action of accepting denying or restricting the activity of a user with respect to a given resource of the premise .

In step of process the reactive control platform determines context information associated with the user the device or a combination thereof. In step the platform determines whether the user a is associated with existing profile information b has one or more previously associated rules c has a previous history of activity or d a combination thereof. As noted previously the status of the user for performing the current activity is based on the determination the context information or a combination thereof and the status indicates whether the user is a new or existing user of the device the one or more services or a combination thereof. In the case for example where the status of the user is determined to be new e.g. a first time user of the resource in question a new profile may be generated in association with the user a device of the user or a combination thereof. In the case where the status of the user indicates they are a previous user the existing profile information may be updated to include the specified rules. By way of this approach a prior set of rules related to the same activity device or service may be overwritten or appended in order to reflect the most recent rule set.

In step the reactive control platform generates the one or more rules automatically based on the status of the user the monitoring of the current activity of the user a history of activity of the user over a period of time a history of the one or more rules enforced over time or a combination thereof. As noted previously the current activity of the user may include a request for access to a channel content a network address a location a device user information or a combination thereof. Also of note the device may be a set top box a router a computer a mobile device a gaming system a communication system or a combination thereof and the one or more services may include a content delivery service a network service a security service an information retrieval service a gaming service a social networking service a communication service or a combination thereof.

In the reactive control platform monitors Johns use of a set top box which is further integrated with a display system . As such the platform maintains activity history information regarding the use of the resources in connection with profile information for John. When John attempts to access content that is rated R a warning message is generated for presentment to John regarding his current activity. This may correspond to a basic level of intelligent monitoring on the part of the platform in lieu of a fully established rule set wherein the login information for indicating the youth of the user is accounted for with respect to the content type attempting to be accessed.

In addition the platform transmits a request message to the mobile device of the subscriber as depicted with respect to . In this case the request message specifies the identity of the user that is currently interacting with a resource some level of detail regarding the activity in which the user is engaging a location of the resource the user is engaging etc. The message is therefore crafted by the platform in a manner to provide sufficient detail to the subscriber regarding the current activity of the user for supporting their ability to establish one or more rules in association with the user and or activity accordingly.

Also presented per the request message are one or more user selection options for receiving a subscriber input or response to the request. Under this scenario the user selection options correspond to one or more action buttons . By way of example an ALLOW action button may be selected by the user for specifying allowance of the action that is currently being performed by John while the DENY action button specifies disallowance of the action. Alternatively the subscriber may select a RESTRICT action button for specifying their decision to limit use of the set top box and or the service for downloading the R rated content on a conditional basis. In the case where the RESTRICT action button is selected an additional configuration interface is presented to the subscriber as depicted with respect to .

In the subscriber is presented with additional selection options for configuring one or more customized rules or limits based on the current activity of the user. By way of example the user may be presented with control elements for establishing a time frame of use of the set top box including an option for setting a specific day or hour range of use. Selection of this option limits use of the set top box and or the current movie to a certain viewing period. Alternatively the time frame may correspond to a time of allowed viewing of the movie thus corresponding to a subscriber preferred time wherein content may be viewed. In the case where John is expected to be doing homework at the time he is attempting to access the movie the subscriber can restrict his viewing to a later time of day.

The control elements may also enable the subscriber to specify their content control preferences including an option for specifying a content type restrictions for John e.g. allow only movies audio and games channels restrictions e.g. allow Disney Channel and Cartoon Network but prevent Showtime content category restrictions e.g. allow only cartoons and educational content and content rating restrictions e.g. allow only G or PG 13 content . In addition the subscriber may specify one or more keywords for establishing customized content filters. So for example in the case where the subscriber specifies the keyword sexual any content of this nature be restricted from use by John. Once configured the subscriber may select the OK action button .

In when the subscriber allows access to the movie content on an unrestricted basis e.g. selection of the ALLOW action button or on a restricted basis e.g. as configured per the configuration interface a message is presented to the display for John. In addition the reactive control platform stores the rules established as profile information in connection with John. John is then permitted to enjoy the movie content per the rules established by the subscriber. In the case where John is not allowed by the subscriber an alternate message may be presented for reflecting this disapproval and the movie content may be discontinued or blocked.

In having monitored John s activity and having established one or more rules in association with John previously the reactive control platform is able to automatically generate or recommend the generation of rules based on the activity of the user. In this example John attempts to access another R rated movie via set top box which is a set top box configured to a LAN of a second residence of the subscriber e.g. a vacation home . Under this scenario having identified John as the user responsible for the triggering action with respect to the set top box the platform accesses the profile information for John. Upon analysis the platform identifies a historical tendency of John to access R rated romantic drama content. In addition the platform identified a typical time of access is 3 pm after school . Still further prior rules established for John s activity with respect to the set top box at the primary residence indicate the subscriber established restrictions of allowing for this content until 4 pm Monday through Friday with the condition that no explicit sexual content is associated with the movie.

Based on this history the platform automatically associates the same rules and restrictions to John s use of the other set top box . As such the profile information for John is updated to indicate that the rules apply to John s use of the set top box at the vacation home as well. In addition a message may be presented to John via the display for indicating the access condition established by the subscriber. Still further the platform may transmit a feedback message to the mobile device of the subscriber for indicating the automated action taken by the platform . In this example the feedback message indicates details regarding the action taken per the applied rules the identity of the user that is currently interacting with the resource some level of detail regarding the activity in which the user is engaging e.g. name and rating of the movie a location of the resource the user is engaging e.g. the set top box at the vacation home etc. The message also indicates the conditional time frame setting.

The subscriber may accept the action by selecting the OK action button . While not shown in this example an additional ADAPT action button may also be presented for allowing the user to adapt the applied rule setting. As such upon selection the subscriber may be presented again with the configuration interface of for enabling customization of the rules.

Still further as another scenario the same rules established with respect to John may also be applied to his younger brother automatically when it is detected the younger brother is interacting with the set top box at the primary residence. The platform may establish these rules based on the historical response of the subscriber to John s activities the status of the user as John s younger brother one year apart contextual information for indicating the time of interaction with movie content etc. Hence the rules are associated with profile information for the younger brother.

In the case where an older sibling who is of driving age is interacting with is a locked garage that features a biometric entry security system the reactive control platform may identify this sibling based on their biometric information. Accordingly the platform may automatically apply a restriction to the security system for restricting access to the garage door until 4 pm based on the restrictions established for the other siblings per the set top boxes and . Hence it is noted that the reactive control platform may generate actions and or rules to be applied automatically based on the historical patterns and or activities with any of the resources of the subscriber. The accuracy of the actions invoked and or recommended may progressively increase over time as additional activities and responses thereto are monitored and recorded by the platform .

While presented herein as an automated action it is noted that the reactive control platform may be configured to provide a recommended action to be executed by the reactive control platform . In this way the rules established for affecting real time interaction of a user with a device is not readily associated with the profile of the user until feedback from the subscriber is acquired. In either implementation however the platform enables the convenient real time establishment of rules regarding the different users and different resources.

The processes described herein for enabling a subscriber to establish rules for controlling user interaction with a resource based on the activity of the user may be implemented via software hardware e.g. general processor Digital Signal Processing DSP chip an Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs etc. firmware or a combination thereof. Such exemplary hardware for performing the described functions is detailed below.

The computer system may be coupled via the bus to a display such as a cathode ray tube CRT liquid crystal display active matrix display or plasma display for displaying information to a computer user. An input device such as a keyboard including alphanumeric and other keys is coupled to the bus for communicating information and command selections to the processor . Another type of user input device is a cursor control such as a mouse a trackball or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to the processor and for adjusting cursor movement on the display .

According to an embodiment of the invention the processes described herein are performed by the computer system in response to the processor executing an arrangement of instructions contained in main memory . Such instructions can be read into main memory from another computer readable medium such as the storage device . Execution of the arrangement of instructions contained in main memory causes the processor to perform the process steps described herein. One or more processors in a multi processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the instructions contained in main memory . In alternative embodiments hard wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the embodiment of the invention. Thus embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.

The computer system also includes a communication interface coupled to bus . The communication interface provides a two way data communication coupling to a network link connected to a local network . For example the communication interface may be a digital subscriber line DSL card or modem an integrated services digital network ISDN card a cable modem a telephone modem or any other communication interface to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of communication line. As another example communication interface may be a local area network LAN card e.g. for Ethernet or an Asynchronous Transfer Model ATM network to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links can also be implemented. In any such implementation communication interface sends and receives electrical electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information. Further the communication interface can include peripheral interface devices such as a Universal Serial Bus USB interface a PCMCIA Personal Computer Memory Card International Association interface etc. Although a single communication interface is depicted in FIG.   multiple communication interfaces can also be employed.

The network link typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example the network link may provide a connection through local network to a host computer which has connectivity to a network e.g. a wide area network WAN or the global packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the Internet or to data equipment operated by a service provider. The local network and the network both use electrical electromagnetic or optical signals to convey information and instructions. The signals through the various networks and the signals on the network link and through the communication interface which communicate digital data with the computer system are exemplary forms of carrier waves bearing the information and instructions.

The computer system can send messages and receive data including program code through the network s the network link and the communication interface . In the Internet example a server not shown might transmit requested code belonging to an application program for implementing an embodiment of the invention through the network the local network and the communication interface . The processor may execute the transmitted code while being received and or store the code in the storage device or other non volatile storage for later execution. In this manner the computer system may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.

The term computer readable medium as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to the processor for execution. Such a medium may take many forms including but not limited to computer readable storage medium or non transitory i.e. non volatile media and volatile media and transmission media. Non volatile media include for example optical or magnetic disks such as the storage device . Volatile media include dynamic memory such as main memory . Transmission media include coaxial cables copper wire and fiber optics including the wires that comprise the bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic optical or electromagnetic waves such as those generated during radio frequency RF and infrared IR data communications. Common forms of computer readable media include for example a floppy disk a flexible disk hard disk magnetic tape any other magnetic medium a CD ROM CDRW DVD any other optical medium punch cards paper tape optical mark sheets any other physical medium with patterns of holes or other optically recognizable indicia a RAM a PROM and EPROM a FLASH EPROM any other memory chip or cartridge a carrier wave or any other medium from which a computer can read.

Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in providing instructions to a processor for execution. For example the instructions for carrying out at least part of the embodiments of the invention may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. In such a scenario the remote computer loads the instructions into main memory and sends the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem of a local computer system receives the data on the telephone line and uses an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal and transmit the infrared signal to a portable computing device such as a personal digital assistant PDA or a laptop. An infrared detector on the portable computing device receives the information and instructions borne by the infrared signal and places the data on a bus. The bus conveys the data to main memory from which a processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory can optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by processor.

In one embodiment the chip set or chip includes a communication mechanism such as a bus for passing information among the components of the chip set . A processor has connectivity to the bus to execute instructions and process information stored in for example a memory . The processor may include one or more processing cores with each core configured to perform independently. A multi core processor enables multiprocessing within a single physical package. Examples of a multi core processor include two four eight or greater numbers of processing cores. Alternatively or in addition the processor may include one or more microprocessors configured in tandem via the bus to enable independent execution of instructions pipelining and multithreading. The processor may also be accompanied with one or more specialized components to perform certain processing functions and tasks such as one or more digital signal processors DSP or one or more application specific integrated circuits ASIC . A DSP typically is configured to process real world signals e.g. sound in real time independently of the processor . Similarly an ASIC can be configured to performed specialized functions not easily performed by a more general purpose processor. Other specialized components to aid in performing the inventive functions described herein may include one or more field programmable gate arrays FPGA not shown one or more controllers not shown or one or more other special purpose computer chips.

In one embodiment the chip set or chip includes merely one or more processors and some software and or firmware supporting and or relating to and or for the one or more processors.

The processor and accompanying components have connectivity to the memory via the bus . The memory includes both dynamic memory e.g. RAM magnetic disk writable optical disk etc. and static memory e.g. ROM CD ROM etc. for storing executable instructions that when executed perform the inventive steps described herein to enable a subscriber to establish rules for controlling user interaction with a resource based on the activity of the user. The memory also stores the data associated with or generated by the execution of the inventive steps.

While certain exemplary embodiments and implementations have been described herein other embodiments and modifications will be apparent from this description. Accordingly the invention is not limited to such embodiments but rather to the broader scope of the presented claims and various obvious modifications and equivalent arrangements.
