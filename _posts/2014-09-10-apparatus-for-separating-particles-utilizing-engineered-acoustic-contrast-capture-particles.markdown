This invention was made with Government support under Contract Number DE AC51 06NA25396 awarded by the United States Department of Energy. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates in general to field based separation of particles in a medium utilizing acoustic pressure.

It was realized early in ultrasonic transport phenomena that particles with different mechanical properties density and compressibility can be separated in a solution. Particles in an ultrasonic standing wave field that are more dense and less compressible than the background medium are transported to a different spatial location than particles that are less dense and more compressible than the background medium producing a true binary separator based upon mechanical properties. Ultrasonic radiation pressure has been demonstrated as a viable means to manipulate and locally trap particles in microfluidic environments. In application the acoustic radiation pressure force depends upon frequency of excitation pressure amplitude within the medium and the density compressibility contrast between the particle of interest and the host medium. Within an applied ultrasonic standing wave particles experience a drift force resulting from acoustic radiation pressure that transports the particles to a position within the applied standing wave that corresponds to minima in the acoustic radiation pressure force potential. In general the location of this minima is located in a different spatial location for particles that are more dense and less compressible than the background medium in comparison to particles that are less dense and more compressible. The technique has been successfully demonstrated in particle conditioning experiments involving trajectory steering agglomeration retainment mixing selective retainment and deposition of cells on a surface.

Separation utilizing acoustic radiation pressure has not been readily implemented in biological problems since most biological particles of interest e.g. red blood cells white blood cells bacteria spores etc. all are more dense and less compressible than water. Recent biological assays have implemented means to separate analytes from sample solutions by taking advantage of their physical properties. For instance positively charged silica surfaces are used to capture highly negative charged DNA molecules from complex samples. More recently capture particles have been employed to capture biological particles of interest. This has been especially true for magnetic field base purification methods where magnetic particles are used to capture particles of interest from within a sample and then separated from the sample using magnetic fields.

It is desirable therefore to provide an apparatus and method for separating particles within a medium utilizing engineered capture particles and acoustic radiation pressure.

An apparatus and a method for separating particles from a medium includes a capillary defining a flow path therein that is in fluid communication with a medium source. The medium source includes engineered acoustic contrast capture particle having a predetermined acoustic contrast. The apparatus includes a vibration generator that is operable to produce at least one acoustic field within the flow path. The acoustic field produces a force potential minima for positive acoustic contrast particles and a force potential minima for negative acoustic contrast particles in the flow path and drives the engineered acoustic contrast capture particles to either the force potential minima for positive acoustic contrast particles or the force potential minima for negative acoustic contrast particles.

The engineered acoustic contrast capture particles may have a negative acoustic contrast and may have a density compressibility ratio less than that of the medium source. Alternatively the engineered acoustic contrast capture particles may have a positive acoustic contrast and may have a density compressibility ratio greater than that of the medium source.

Alternatively the medium source includes particles having positive acoustic contrast and particles having negative acoustic contrast and the acoustic field drives the positive acoustic contrast particles to the potential minima for positive acoustic contrast particles and the negative acoustic contrast particles to the potential minima for negative acoustic contrast particles. The positive acoustic contrast particles may be bioparticles. The force potential minima for positive contrast particles may be a pressure node and the force potential minima for negative contrast particles may be a pressure antinode.

Alternatively the engineered acoustic contrast capture particles are functionalized to bind to corresponding targets in the medium. The engineered acoustic contrast capture particles may bind to the targets with antibodies. The targets may be biological molecules or particles. The vibration generator may be a transducer or a line drive element.

Alternatively the acoustic field is a dipole acoustic field and the force potential minima for positive acoustic contrast particles may be located along a center of the flow path and the force potential minima for negative acoustic contrast particles may be located adjacent a wall of the capillary. Alternatively the acoustic field is an axisymmetric acoustic field and the force potential minima for negative acoustic contrast particles may be located along a center of the flow path and the force potential minima for positive acoustic contrast particles may be located adjacent a wall of the capillary.

Alternatively the capillary is an inner capillary disposed within an outer capillary and the vibration generator may be disposed adjacent the outer capillary. The capillary may be quartz glass or plastic. The apparatus may further comprise a laser beam for analysis of the particles in the medium. The vibration generator may be capable of alternately producing a dipole acoustic field and an axisymmetric acoustic field.

Objects advantages and novel features and further scope of applicability of the present invention will be set forth in part in the detailed description to follow taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.

The acoustic radiation pressure force on a compressible spherical particle of volume V in an arbitrary acoustic field can be written in terms of an acoustic radiation pressure force potential U 

Here a is the particle radius is the compressibility of the surrounding fluid and is the density of the surrounding fluid. The pressure and velocity of the acoustic field in the absence of the particle are described by p and v respectively and the brackets correspond to a time averaged quantity. The terms fand fare the contrast terms that determine how the mechanical properties of the particle differ from the background medium. They are given by 

The subscript p corresponds to intrinsic properties of the particle. The force F acting on a particle is related to the gradient of the force potential by 

For acoustic wavefields comprised of plane waves the potential minima of U occur at either pressure nodes or antinodes depending upon the signs of fand f. Most particles and cells of interest in a water or aqueous background medium have properties that yield positive values of fand f. These particles are termed positive acoustic contrast particles. Under the plane wave approximation these particles will migrate to the pressure nodes velocity antinodes in the system. Examples of these particles in water based buffers include erythrocytes leukocytes bacteria yeast or any other particles where density and compressibility contrast terms fand fare positive. Materials such as fat globules and gas bubbles yield negative values of both fand fand are termed negative contrast particles. Under the plane wave approximation these particles will move to the location of a pressure antinode. This system can be used as a binary particle separator that spatially localizes particles into discrete locations in the wavefield pressure nodes or antinodes based upon positive or negative acoustic contrast of the particles relative to the background medium.

When the wavefield takes on greater complexity than described by plane wave approximations e.g. cylindrical or spherical waves the location of the localization of the particles within the wavefield is determined by the minima of the force potential U. In these cases the pressure nodes and antinodes do not generally occur at the same spatial locations as the potential minima. But similar to the plane wave case the particles can generally be separated in a binary manner based upon their intrinsic properties relative to the background medium. The binary spatial positions where positive and negative acoustic contrast particles localize is now determined by minima in the force potential U.

The contrast factors fand fdemonstrate the significance of the relative values of the intrinsic properties of the particles and the medium. As shown in for most particles in bio research and biomedical applications including but not limited to erythrocytes phagocytes spores yeast fungi and bacteria as well as plastics sand common sediments and metals the contrast term is positive for particles in an aqueous background and all particles in a given sample are forced to the location of the same potential minima in the standing wave field. Therefore acoustic binary separation of most biological particles in an aqueous solution is not feasible without adjusting the properties of the background medium. Separation of lipids from blood by using their negative acoustic contrast relative to the other blood components has been demonstrated by others.

The engineered acoustic contrast capture particles when attached to bioparticles of interest shifts the effective density and compressibility of the bioparticle capture particle construct from positive to negative or negative to positive depending upon the preferred separation criteria relative to other particles in the system. As an example an engineered capture particle is designed with low density and high compressibility relative to an aqueous medium. The particle is functionalized with anit CD45 ligands and introduced into a blood sample to bind to CD45 markers on leukocytes. Under conditions where the blood sample is suspended in an aqueous buffer both the erythrocytes and leukocytes have positive acoustic contrast and under the action of an acoustic standing wave are forced to the same potential minima By attaching an engineered particle with negative acoustic contrast to the leukocyte the capture particle leukocyte construct takes on negative acoustic contrast and be advantageously separated from the positive contrast population of erythrocytes.

Referring now to apparatus in accordance with the present invention is indicated generally at . The apparatus includes capillary defining therein flow path or stream in fluid communication with a medium source not shown within walls of capillary . Capillary is preferably constructed from quartz glass plastic or any suitable material. Preferably capillary is circular in cross section but those skilled in the art will appreciate that the cross section of capillary may be of any suitable geometry including but not limited to elliptical square rectangular or the like. The medium source may supply water or any suitable liquid to flow path or stream as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. Capillary is fully disposed within outer capillary . Vibration generator such as a transducer the like is disposed adjacent or mounted to an exterior surface of capillary and is capable of producing at least one acoustic or displacement field within flow stream of capillary . Alternatively vibration generator is a line drive element a displacement generator or any other type of vibration generator adjacent or mounted to the exterior surface of capillary capable of producing at least one acoustic or displacement field within flow path or stream including but not limited to a contact aperture a line contact and a full encompassment of capillary as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. Under different symmetry excitations of the displacement field the position of a force potential minima for positive contrast particles can be located along the central axis or flow stream of capillary or the force potential minima for positive contrast particles can be located at a position along wall . In these situations the force potential minima for negative acoustic contrast particles will be located at the position not occupied by positive acoustic contrast particles e.g. positive acoustic contrast particles along the central axis of flow stream corresponds to negative acoustic contrast particles at a position along capillary wall or negative acoustic contrast particles along the central axis of flow stream corresponds to positive acoustic contrast particles at a position along capillary wall .

Disposed within flow stream are bioparticles and engineered acoustic contrast capture particles . As shown in with no acoustic field being generated by vibration generator i.e. the acoustic field is inactive bioparticles and negative contrast capture particles are homogeneously distributed within flow stream of capillary . As shown in when a dipole acoustic excitation and resulting dipole acoustic field is implemented by vibration generator bioparticles are focused to the center of flow stream of capillary force potential minima for positive acoustic contrast particles and engineered acoustic contrast capture particles with negative contrast are transported to capillary wall force potential minima for negative acoustic contrast particles . Conversely as shown in when an axisymmetric excitation and resulting axisymmetric acoustic field is implemented by vibration generator all bioparticles are sent to capillary wall force potential minima for positive acoustic contrast particles and engineered acoustic contrast capture particles with negative contrast are focused to the central axis of flow stream of capillary force potential minima for negative acoustic contrast particles .

In a non limiting example background bioparticles comprising 6 .mu.m latex spheres and engineered acoustic contrast capture particles with negative contrast comprising hollow glass microspheres having low density high compressibility characteristics were utilized in apparatus . Upon activation of vibration generator generating a dipole acoustic field such as shown in latex spheres are focused to the center of flow stream of capillary while hollow glass spheres are transported to wall of capillary . This is shown in . A microscope with a narrow depth of field not shown is utilized to demonstrate the location of positive and negative contrast particles in apparatus . In the focal plane of the microscope intersects the central axis of flow stream of capillary where positive contrast particles latex spheres have been focused along the axis and engineered negative contrast particles glass microspheres can be seen along capillary wall . In the focal plane of the microscope intersects an uppermost boundary of inner capillary wall . Here negative contrast particles glass microspheres are located adjacent capillary wall . Before activation of the acoustic field particles and were homogenously distributed throughout capillary such as shown in

Referring now to in this embodiment engineered acoustic contrast capture particles with negative contrast are functionalized with a specific coating to bind a target particle of interest such as by functionalizing and coating engineered negative contrast capture particles with antibody . Negative contrast capture particles and antibodies are mixed with a sample incubated and are bound to target cells . Target cells are preferably biological molecules or particles. Upon flowing the sample through flow stream of capillary excited in an axisymmetric vibration mode by vibration generator engineered negative contrast capture particles with captured target cells are focused to the center of flow stream of capillary for analysis by laser beam flow cytometry or separation. The sample background particles as they are bioparticles similar to bioparticles shown in FIGS. are forced to wall of capillary . In a flow cytometer not shown laser beam is focused to probe only those particles that transport along the axis of flow stream of capillary .

Apparatus preferably includes vibration generator capable of driving capillary in both axisymmetric and dipole modes advantageously allowing for separate analysis of target particles and remaining sample background particles . Engineered negative acoustic contrast capture particles are transported to the position of a minima of the force potential for negative contrast particles in an acoustic field. Conversely all other bioparticles are transported to the position of a minima of the force potential for positive contrast particles in an acoustic field. In a flow cytometer functionalized engineered negative contrast capture particles can be mixed with a sample. The untrapped sample or specific binding to capture particles can be analyzed by placing or designing either the force potential minima for positive acoustic contrast particles or negative acoustic contrast particles at the center of the sample analysis flow stream .

Apparatus advantageously takes advantage of the fact that most bioparticles such as bioparticles shown in through possess positive acoustic contrast and can be spatially isolated at a specific predetermined location defined by the force potential minima for positive acoustic contrast particles in an acoustic field as the only particles that have negative contrast are acoustically similar to lipids fats. By engineering capture particles with a negative acoustic contrast it is possible to separate engineered negative contrast capture particles and from biological particles and most other background particles in a sample as shown in . Under the action of an acoustic field biological particles will transport to the minima in the force potential for positive contrast particle while engineered negative contrast capture particles will transport to the minima in the force potential for negative contrast particles. In general the spatial location defined by the force potential minima of positive and negative acoustic contrast particles are isolated from one another or at distinct predetermined locations within flow stream of capillary .

Apparatus advantageously employs engineered acoustic contrast capture particles with negative contrast and having a density compressibility ratio less than that of the medium source i.e. particles and are less dense and more compressible than the background fluid medium in the medium source such as water . If the medium in flow stream of capillary is not water the contrast properties of engineered acoustic contrast capture particles and may be advantageously adjusted according to the medium to take on either negative or positive contrast values. Engineered acoustic contrast capture particles and are used to capture bioparticles of interest in a sample. When used in conjunction with an acoustically driven cylindrical channel engineered acoustic contrast capture particles and can be forced to the center of flow stream or wall of capillary and separated from the remaining sample constituents. This is very effective in new assays for flow cytometry that require target cells or constituents to be separated from a background. Alternatively engineered acoustic contrast particles and have a positive acoustic contrast and have a density compressibility ratio greater than that of the medium source i.e. particles and are more dense and less compressible than the background fluid medium in the medium source such as water .

Apparatus may be advantageously utilized in commercial applications including but not limited to applications involving the separation of specific targets in biological samples.
