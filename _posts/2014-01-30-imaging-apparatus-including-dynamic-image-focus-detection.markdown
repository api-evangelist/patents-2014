The present invention relates to an imaging apparatus and in particular it relates to an imaging function of a portable device such as a digital camera a camera equipped cellular phone or PDA.

Recently commonly used digital still cameras have been capable of recording videos similar to video cameras and further capable of performing automatic focusing AF during recording. However bothersome adjustments to settings are often required for functions that can be obtained naturally by a digital still camera such as focusing control for example to fix focusing on an AF result fixed focusing . Accordingly it has been desired to improve operability thereof.

In Kokai No. 2006 301378 angular field variation caused in focus operation during video recording is suppressed by narrowing a scanning area compared to a scanning area set in a still image capture. However this method is not sufficient for performing a focusing operation suitable for an environment such as the abovementioned fixed focusing. In Kokai No. 2012 002951 an object is tracked and focused upon by changing an AF area during a focus operation carried out in a still image capture.

Further some conventional digital cameras include a dedicated AF button hereinafter called AF button . In this configuration an AF operation performed during imaging is controlled by a button that is separate from the release switch while a normal conventional AF operation is performed in conjunction with a release switch operation.

However according to the above structure the apparatus is not operationally user friendly because a function of the AF button overlaps with the release switch and is not separate therefrom.

Therefore one aspect of the present invention is to improve usability of an imaging apparatus by expanding functions of an AF button during before and after video recording and in still image capturing.

According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided an imaging apparatus including an image sensor that receives light from an object through an imaging lens a lens driver that moves the imaging lens and an automatic focus detector which determines a lens in focus position based on imaging data obtained from the image sensor the automatic focus detector being capable of performing a focus detection operation with a second switch which is different from a release switch in that it includes a dynamic image focus detector and a still image focus detector and the dynamic image focus detector further including a focus detection operation selector that varies the focus detection operation controlled by the second switch in accordance with whether a video is being recorded.

According to the present invention it is possible to provide an imaging apparatus which has a dedicated AF button with expanded functions that is user friendly during before and after video image recording and during still image recording or capturing. By providing an AF button with different operations based on whether video image or still image recording is underway it becomes easy to further improve operability of an AF operation process that is required during each recording mode.

The memory card controller unit is connected to a contact point of a memory card slot for a card connection.

Next operations of the digital still camera which is structured as described above are described. An operational summary of a conventional digital still camera is also described. The camera is activated in a recording mode by setting the mode dial SW illustrated in to the recording mode.

According to the setting of the mode dial SW the CPU detects that the mode switch SW which is included in the operational key unit in is in a recording mode ON state so that the motor driver is controlled to move the lens barrel unit to a position where imaging can be performed. Further power is supplied to respective portions such as the CCD the F E IC and the LCD monitor is activated so that operations thereof are started. When power is supplied to the respective portions an operation in a finder mode is started.

In the finder mode light entering the image sensor CCD through a lens is converted into an electric signal and then the signal is transmitted to the CDS circuit and the A D converter as R G and B analog signals. Each signal converted into a digital signal at the A D converter is converted into a YUV signal in a digital signal processing IC SDRAM and the YUV signal is stored in a frame memory by a memory controller. The YUV signal is read out by the memory controller and is sent to a TV or the LCD monitor via the TV signal display unit so that an image is displayed. The above process is performed at intervals of 1 30 second so that a display in the finder mode is updated at intervals of 1 30 second.

When the release switch SW is depressed the CPU calculates an AF evaluation value which indicates a focusing degree of a screen from digital RGB signals transmitted to a CCD I F unit of the signal processing IC. The AF evaluation value data is read out by a microcomputer as characteristic data and is used for AF processing. Since edges of an object become sharp in a focused state an integral value thereof contains the highest high frequency component.

According to the above during an AF focus detection operation an AF evaluation value is obtained at each focus lens position to determine where the value is maximized peak position . In consideration of a case that a plurality of peak positions exist AF is performed with the focus position determined by the most reliable position among the plurality of peak positions which is determined by evaluating the size of the evaluation values of the peak positions and degree of their relative increase and decrease with respect to peripheral evaluation values.

When the AF button switch SW is depressed an operation is performed that is partially different from the operation controlled by the release shutter switch SW in accordance with a position of the AF lever . shows an enlarged view of the AF lever. The AF lever has positions of AFL and AFC. AFL provides an AF lock function to fix a focus position after AF is performed. AFC provides a continuous AF function to continuously perform AF.

Further the AF button switch SW provides in a state of being continuously depressed a maintain mode in which the AF operation can be set to be maintained as follows. In a case that the maintain mode is ON the above state can be continuously maintained even after the AF button is released. In a case that the maintain mode is OFF the operation can be continued only when the AF button is continuously depressed. The maintain mode can be set within a menu by selecting the menu switch SW. Here when the switching is performed by the mode dial SW as well operability can be improved.

The AF evaluation value can be calculated from the digital RGB signals in a specific area. illustrate states of display on the LCD monitor in the finder mode. Center frames in the display indicate AF areas of the digital camera. Here the AF area during AF controlled by the release switch SW is different from that during AF controlled by the AF button switch SW.

Switching can be performed between a normal AF mode controlled by the release switch SW and a spot AF controlled by the AF button. For example in the normal AF mode an area of the AF frame in the display measures 40 of the length of the display in the horizontal direction and 30 in the vertical direction as illustrated in . In the spot AF mode the area represents 20 of the display in the horizontal direction and 20 in the vertical direction as illustrated in . In order to improve an operator s acknowledgement the AF frame may be displayed when an in focus position is detected while the AF frame is not be displayed when an in focus position is not been detected.

Next a timing relationship between the driving of the focus lens and the calculation of the AF evaluation value during AF processing is described. Driving of the focus lens is performed by a predetermined focus drive amount in accordance with a single VD Vertical Drive signal. In a case that the focus motor is a pulse motor for example the focus drive amount corresponds to the number of drive pulses. One focus lens driving sequence is completed by driving the focus lens by the predetermined number of drive pulses at a predetermined pulse rate in accordance with a tailing edge of a VD signal pulse. The predetermined focus driving is performed again in accordance with a tailing edge of the subsequently output VD signal pulse. Thus the focus driving is performed in synchronization with VD signals i.e. frame cycle .

As illustrated in when a single VD signal is generated see two pulses for driving the focus lens are generated having the VD signal as a trigger see . Accordingly the focus lens is driven and moved by a drive amount corresponding to the two drive pulses. Further the predetermined number of charge sweeping pulses SUB are generated having the VD signal as a trigger see a process to sweep charges from the CCD is performed in accordance with the number of the charge sweeping pulses SUB .

Then an exposure process is performed after the charge sweeping process is completed see . An image of an object is captured as image data with the exposure process and then the AF evaluation value is calculated based on the image data. The number of the drive pulses may be varied in accordance with a focal length a focus lens protruding amount focus lens drive range and the like. In this manner the AF process in the present embodiment is performed within the drive range of the focus lens and synchronized with the VD signals.

Regarding the complete flow of the AF process the AF process with the release switch SW will be described using and the AF process with the AF button switch SW will be described using .

Here the following describes an AF operation performed when the camera is in the finder mode after being powered ON.

In regarding the normal AF process with the release switch SW first it is determined whether or not the release switch SW is depressed S . When the release switch SW is depressed YES in S the normal AF process is performed S . The normal AF process is described using a flowchart of .

Referring to first the focus optical system see is driven from a current position to an AF start position S . Here the focus optical system is moved to a relatively close position. The close position may be different for each optical system. In general it is preferable to be moved in the neighborhood of 30 cm from the camera.

Next the focus optical system is driven to an infinity position at constant intervals. Here a stepper motor is used as the focus motor so that the focus lens is driven from 30 cm to the infinity position in steps such as four pulses per each step. After waiting for the VD signal S the focus lens is moved S and the AF evaluation value for the AF area is calculated S .

Next a peak determination process is performed based on the calculated AF evaluation value. Here a peak position is determined among the evaluation values while assessing the reliability of the AF evaluation values. In a case that a reliable peak position exists the focus position thereof is accepted and stored as peak detection OK AFOK . In a case that the peak position does not exist it is assessed as focusing NG. In a case that a peak is not detected i.e. focusing NG YES in S it is determined whether or not the current position is an end position infinity position S . When it is not the end position the procedure returns to S and the process is repeated. On the other hand in the case of peak detection OK NO in S the procedure ends.

Next returning to a focus position determining process is performed S . When a peak is detected in the AF process the detected peak position is determined to be the focus position. On the other hand when a peak is not detected an NG position is determined to be the focus position as AFNG. Here the NG position denotes a position of the focus lens where an object at a distance of about 2.5 m is in focus.

Lastly a process to move the focus lens to the focus position is performed S . The AF process with the release switch SW is as described above. In a and b indicate driving of the focus lens a range thereof and an evaluation value output result with the normal AF process.

Referring to an AF operation of a digital camera according to a first embodiment will be described. Regarding the AF process with the AF button switch SW first it is determined whether or not the AF button switch SW is depressed S . When the AF button switch SW is depressed YES in S it is determined in which state the AF button is depressed and an AF button operation selecting process to select an AF operation corresponding thereto is performed S . As illustrated in the flowchart of according to the AF button operation selecting process the operation varies in accordance with whether or not video recording is in effect. In a case in which video recording is in effect YES in S an AF button operation for video recording is selected S otherwise a normal AF button operation is selected S .

When the AF button operation is selected S the selected AF button operation process is performed S as indicated in the flowchart of . is an operational correspondence table for a case when the normal AF button operation is selected. As indicated in the operation is determined to be continued or ended stopped after the AF button is released in accordance with whether or not the AF button is set to the maintain mode. The actual procedure is indicated in the flowchart of .

When the AF button is depressed YES in S while a maintain flag is OFF YES in S and the AF lever is in the AFL position YES in S the normal AF process which is similar to the AF process activated by the release switch SW is performed S . In a case where the AF lever is in the AFC position NO in S a continuous AF process is performed S in contrast. According to the continuous AF process AF is not performed in the range of the normal AF process but instead in the vicinity of the current focus lens position. However the basic operation is the same as that of the normal AF process in .

An operational chart of the continuous AF process is indicated in . The actual movement range is narrower than that of the normal AF process so that the AF evaluation values appear in the vicinity of a peak position as illustrated in . Therefore the process can be completed rapidly by the amount thereof. As being continuously performed the process is called continuous AF. When the maintain mode is ON S after the normal AF process S provides OK in AF YES in S or after the continuous AF process is completed the maintain flag is set to be ON S and the release switch SW is invalidated S . Thus the procedure ends. Otherwise the maintain flag is set to be OFF S and the release switch SW is validated S . Then the procedure ends.

According to the above when AF is OK at AFL imaging can be performed in a state in which the focus position is locked called AF lock . When at AFC continuous AF can be performed regardless of depression of the release switch SW. The above is indicated in as ON states of and at maintain mode ON and states of and at maintain mode OFF.

Next returning to S since AF lock or continuous AF has been under operation when the maintain flag is ON NO in S a stop cancellation process is performed and AF lock or continuous AF is stopped S . Subsequently the maintain flag is set to OFF and the release switch SW is validated S . Then the processing ends. The above is indicated in as OFF states of and at maintain mode ON.

Even when the AF button is OFF in S continuous AF is performed S when the maintain flag is ON YES in S and the AF lever is at AFC YES in S . The above is indicated in as a state of . Otherwise no process is performed as corresponding to states of and at maintain mode OFF in . is an operational correspondence table regarding the AF button operation during video recording. As indicated in the present embodiment is unique because operations are different between AFL and AFC which is dissimilar from when the normal AF button operation is selected. The actual procedure is indicated in the flowchart of which will be described later in detail.

When a video is to be recorded a wobbling operation is automatically started in advance. This is indicated by the flowchart of . First an AF evaluation value is calculated based on a current focus position S . Next predetermined pulse driving is performed toward a close position as a first driving procedure in the present embodiment S . The pulse amount is calculated as an amount to prevent angular field variation due to focus driving within one VD interval in finder mode and as an amount to eliminate focus drive noise. In general it is preferable that the amount is in the order of a half depth of field.

Then an AF evaluation value is calculated for the position after the driving is completed S . Next predetermined pulse driving is performed for focusing in a second driving procedure in an opposite direction that is toward an infinity position in the present embodiment S . Here the driving is performed toward the infinity side at twice the pulse amount of the first driving procedure. Then an AF evaluation value is calculated based on the position after the driving is completed S .

Subsequently since three AF evaluation values are obtained by this stage the position having the highest evaluation value is selected among the evaluation values and determined as a third drive position S . Lastly driving is performed to the third position S and the procedure ends. The above operation is repeated during video recording.

In and indicate the operation and evaluation values for those positions. Since the number of the AF evaluation values is only three it is the fastest process compared to the abovementioned normal AF and continuous AF processes. In addition the operator cannot realize whether or not focus driving is performed. Accordingly the above is a driving method that is generally adopted for a video camera. Video recording is started from the state in which the wobbling operation is performed.

Next the AF button operation during video recording will be described with reference to the flowchart of . When the AF button is depressed YES in S while a maintain flag is OFF YES in S and the AF lever is at AFL YES in S a focus drive stopping process is performed S . This is used to set focusing to a fixed position such that the wobbling operation during video recording is stopped.

When the maintain mode is ON YES in S the maintain flag is set to ON S and the procedure ends. Otherwise the maintain flag is set to OFF S and the procedure ends. According it is possible to quickly change focusing state during video recording to a fixed state when the operator desires. The above processes correspond to an ON state of at maintain mode ON and a state of at maintain mode OFF which are indicated in . When the AF lever is at AFC NO in S a refresh normal AF process is performed S . This is for a case that the operator desires to intentionally use AF because of slow tracking with the wobbling operation and the like. Subsequently after AF is performed again wobbling is restarted from the focus position S and the maintain flag is set to OFF S . Then the procedure ends. The above is indicated in as a state of at maintain mode ON and a state of at maintain mode OFF.

Next returning to S since focusing has been stopped when the maintain flag is ON NO in S wobbling is restarted S . The above is indicated in as an OFF state of in maintain mode ON.

Returning to S when the AF button is OFF NO in S while the maintain flag is ON YES in S and the AF lever is at AFL NO in S no process is performed since it is in the AF lock state. Otherwise the wobbling process is continued S .

Next returning to a focus position determining process is performed S . In a case that a peak is detected in the AF process the peak position is determined to be the focus position. In a case that a peak is not detected an NG position is determined to be the focus position as AFNG. Here the NG position denotes a position of the focus lens where an object at a distance of about 2.5 m is in focus during the refresh normal AF process.

Lastly a process to move the focus lens to the focus position is performed S . Here since determining and driving have been performed during wobbling determining of the focus position is not performed. The AF process controlled by the AF button SW is as described above.

Regarding the normal AF operation during video recording there is a concern that focus drive noise could be recorded during video recording. Therefore it is preferable that focus driving is decelerated so as to eliminate influence of the noise. The above is due to the focus lens system.

As described above owing to changing an operation with the AF button during video recording it becomes possible to quickly perform focus fixing and carry out an AF operation during video recording while improving operability. That is owing to that an operation with the AF button is differentiated between video recording and still image recording it becomes easy to further improve operability while actualizing an AF operation which is required during each recording. That is it is possible to provide an imaging apparatus which is user friendly during before and after video recording and during still image recording or capturing.

Next an operation of a digital camera according to a second embodiment will be described. Referring to in regard to the AF process with the AF button switch SW it is first determined whether or not the AF button switch SW is depressed S . When the AF button switch SW is depressed YES in S the state in which the AF button is depressed is determined so that the AF button operation selecting process can select an AF operation corresponding to that particular state S .

As illustrated in the flowchart of according to the AF button operation selecting process the operation varies in accordance with whether or not video recording is in effect. In a case of video recording YES in S the AF button operation during video recording is selected otherwise the normal AF button operation is selected S . After the AF button operation is selected the selected AF button operation process is performed S .

The table in corresponds to a case where the normal AF button operation is selected. As indicated in the operation is determined to be continued or ended stopped after the AF button switch SW is released in accordance with whether or not the AF button is set to maintain mode. The actual procedure is indicated by the flowchart of . Since the above is the same as the first embodiment detailed description thereof will not be repeated.

The table in corresponds to the AF button operation during video recording. As indicated in the present embodiment is unique in that operations are different between AFL and AFC from when the normal AF button operation is selected. The actual procedure is indicated by the flowchart of .

Next when a video is to be recorded when the AF button operation during video recording is selected a wobbling operation is automatically started in advance. This is indicated by the flowchart of . Since the above is the same as the first embodiment a detailed description thereof will not be repeated.

Next the AF button operation during video recording will be described with reference to the flowchart of . When the AF button is depressed YES in S while a maintain flag is OFF YES in S and the AF lever is at AFL YES in S a focus drive stopping process is performed S . This is to set focusing to a fixed state while stopping driving of the wobbling operation during video recording. The above is indicated in as states of in maintain mode ON and OFF.

When AF lever is at AFC NO in S a tracking AF process is performed S . This is for a case that the operator desires to intentionally use AF because of slow tracking with the wobbling operation and the like. Here further tracking of an object is effective when changing composition during video recording.

In tracking AF continuous AF is performed while an AF area tracks an object. Regarding the object tracking it is determined whether or not motion of an object image is detected. A variety of technologies have been proposed for motion detecting. Here a template matching process is performed as follows. In the template matching process a search is conducted where image data for a tracking target e.g. image data in a range of an AF area in appears in image data of the next frame.

Here consideration is given to a case in which the object moves as illustrated in . illustrates a range and a direction of the position searching. A template is moved vertically horizontally and obliquely within a range which that is divided into six by six sections. Then a position having the highest degree of coincidence with the image data is determined to be a moved position. illustrates a position detected after the movement.

As described above a variety of tracking methods have been proposed. Therefore there is a possibility to perform the process faster by using for example a pattern coincidence method with boosting algorithm instead of calculating an image data difference described above. Thus it is possible to actualize tracking AF by performing continuous AF with a tracking area in the vicinity of an object tracked.

Returning to when the tracking AF result is OK YES in S and when the maintain mode is ON YES in S the maintain flag is set to ON S . Then the procedure ends. On the other hand when the tracking AF result is NG NO in S the maintain flag is set to OFF S and the procedure ends. The above is indicated in as a state of in maintain mode ON and a state of in maintain mode OFF.

Next returning to S when the maintain flag is ON NO in S and the maintain mode is ON YES in S since focusing has been stopped at AFL and the wobbling process is under operation in the tracking area at AFC normal wobbling is restarted S and the maintain flag is set to OFF S . Then the procedure ends. Here no process is performed except for restart REST and cancel CANC of and in maintain mode ON in .

Next returning to S when the AF button is OFF NO in S while the maintain flag is ON YES S and the AF lever is at AFL NO in S no process is performed since it is in the AF lock state. When the AF lever is at AFC YES in S the wobbling process is continued with the AF area tracking S .

When the maintain flag is OFF NO in S wobbling is restarted S and the maintain flag is set to OFF S . Then the procedure ends. The above is indicated in as states and in maintain mode OFF.

Next returning to a focus position determining process is performed S . When a peak is detected in the AF process the peak position is determined to be the focus position. However when a peak is not detected an NG position is determined to be the focus position as AFNG. Here the NG position denotes a position of the focus lens where an object at a distance of about 2.5 m is in focus during refresh normal AF.

Lastly a process to move the focus lens to the focus position is performed S . Here since determining and driving have been performed during wobbling determining of the focus position is not performed. The AF process with the AF button SW is as described above.

As described above by changing operations with the AF button during video recording it becomes possible to quickly fix focusing in an AF operation during video recording while improving operability. Further in the present embodiments since an object may move during video recording tracking with an AF area in the continuous AF and the like are performed during video recording. Accordingly focusing is facilitated without moving a camera or shifting a screen.

Thus owing to that an operation with the AF button is differentiated between video recording and still image recording it becomes easy to further improve operability while actualizing an AF operation which is required during each type of recording. That is it is possible to provide an imaging apparatus which is user friendly during before and after video recording and during still image recording.
