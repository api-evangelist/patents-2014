title: Content sharing technology
abstract: In one implementation, a computer system receives a request from a first user to perform an operation related to a file stored by the computer system. The file is associated with a second user, and the second user has shared the file with the first user with one or more conditions on the usage of the file by the first user. Based on the first user requesting to perform the operation, the computer system evaluates whether the one or more conditions placed on the usage of the file by the first user allow the first user to perform the operation. Based on evaluation results, the computer system determines that the one or more conditions placed on the usage of the file by the first user allow the first user to perform the operation and authorizes performance of the operation.

This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 790 914 filed Mar. 15 2013 and titled Content Sharing which is incorporated by reference.

A user may be associated with content and may be capable of performing various operations relating to the content such as accessing the content editing the content and or sharing the content with other users.

Content may be created by users and may be stored at a computing system. Thereafter users may be able to access the content and to perform operations relating to the content. Such operations may include for example viewing the content editing the content electronically signing the content copying the content or saving the content locally to a user s device. In some instances particular content may be sharable content. A user associated with the particular content may request to share the particular content with another user and the computing system may enable the content to the shared with the other user for example by also associating the particular content with the other user.

Techniques are described that enable a user to share content with another user for example such that the user with whom the content is shared may perform operations relating to the content. When a user shares content with another user one or more conditions may be applied to the shared content such that the user with whom the content is shared only may perform operations relating to the shared content when the one or more conditions are satisfied. Although examples described herein reference documents for ease of explanation the systems and methods described are applicable to any number of forms of content including document content spreadsheet content image content video content audio content read only document content web page content etc.

In some instances the operations described herein may be performed by a user with a client device such as a mobile computing device where the user may access an application executing on the client device to share access and or perform other operations relating to documents. Such an application may further be used to manage access to particular documents as well as to manage user credentials that allow a user having a credential to access or perform other operations relating to documents. illustrate example interfaces pertaining to such an implementation where users may perform the described operations by accessing the application running on the client device.

In order to access or otherwise perform an operation relating to a document the user may select the document from menu where selecting the document may include touching a corresponding area on a presence sensitive display of the client device or any other selection method. For example user selection of document may cause an interface similar to the interface illustrated in to be displayed.

The interface may provide one or more options for satisfying the condition placed on accessing the document Meeting Notes. For example the one or more options may include an option to demonstrate permission by proving Proximity to the Document Owner and an option to demonstrate permission by providing a verification mechanism for the user John Smith. Satisfying either of the two options may satisfy the requirement of permission from the user John Smith. The interface may also include methods for selecting one of the options such as a checkbox associated with each of the one or more options . User selection of one of the options may enable the user to satisfy a particular requirement relating to performing operations on the document for example by providing a method of demonstrating permission by providing co location to the user John Smith or demonstrating permission by providing information unique to John Smith. Selecting option for example may provide the user with the interface shown in where the user may use the interface in in providing a verification mechanism that demonstrates that the particular user has permission from the user John Smith. Interface may also include an option to close the current interface allowing a user to exit the interface that is displaying the various conditions associated with performing operations relating to the document. shows an example of a user interface that enables the user to satisfy the condition associated with performing an operation related to the document. For example user interface may be presented to a user based on the user selecting an option to provide verification to perform the operation of accessing the document called Meeting Notes. User interface may include a title identifying the user interface for example the title Provide Verification Mechanism shown in . As shown in user interface a user may be able to input a verification mechanism using one of a variety of formats as shown by options where the options may be one of an ultrasonic sound code a quick response QR code and or an alphanumeric code. In practice other formats may be used for providing verification of permission. For example the verification mechanism may be any other encoded signal such as a near field communication NFC signal or a communication signal that uses the Bluetooth standard may be a barcode that encodes an alphanumeric code used for verification or may be any other acceptable verification mechanism In some implementations a verification mechanism may identify a particular user may be associated with a particular document or may be a unique code generated by the system for the purpose of enforcing conditions on the performing of operations relating to the document. For example the document may be associated with a condition that requires a particular user to provide permission to access the document and the verification mechanism provided may be a user identifier pertaining to the particular user. For the example user interface shown in a user has selected an option to provide a quick response QR code to access the document Meeting Notes. Based on the selected option user interface may provide instructions relating to providing the verification mechanism. For example the user interface displays the instructions Scan QR Code in the Screen View to Provide Verification. The user interface may provide an entry field where a user can provide the verification mechanism related to accessing the document. As shown in the entry field may be a screen view entry field where a user may scan a quick response QR code to access the document for example by using a camera affixed to a client device associated with the user. The user interface may also include an option to close where selecting the option may exit the current user interface and may for example return the user to another interface such as interface .

The interface further includes a slider that enables output of different validation mechanisms at the client device. For example the slider may enable the client device to output an encoded signal to provide as a validation mechanism e.g. an ultrasonic NFC Bluetooth or other signal an alphanumeric string a unique image or another suitable validation mechanism. Based on a user providing a verification mechanism such as that shown in interface to a client device requesting to perform operations relating to a document such as a client device outputting the interface the system may determine that the verification mechanism validates the request from the user to perform the requested operation on the document.

The server may be any suitable computer or collection of computers executing software capable of storing and managing content conditions on the usage of content and user credentials via a network as described herein. The network may be for example a local area network LAN or a wide area network WAN such as the Internet. As described herein a client device such as client device may be any type of computing device including but not limited to a mobile phone smart phone personal digital assistant PDA music player e book reader tablet computer laptop computer desktop computer or other stationary or portable device that includes one or more processors and non transitory computer readable storage media. Software applications associated with the client devices can be written in any suitable programming language capable of performing operations assigned to the particular software applications such as for example Objective C C Java etc.

Functionally the server stores and manages content and conditions on the usage of the content. Additionally the server stores and manages credentials associated with users and uses these credentials to manage and verify the usage of specific content. The server provides content to users for example at one or more client devices enabling the users to perform operations on the content. In some instances the content may be content that has been shared with a first user by a second user that is associated with the content and the server may provide the content to the first user based on the user being authorized to perform operations relating to the content.

Content conditions on the usage of content and information identifying users that own specific content and users with whom specific content has been shared can be stored in a database e.g. MySQL PostgreSQL MS SQL Server MongoDB or other suitable data structure that can be accessed by a server . In some instances the server may access content conditions associated with the content and the other information via web services such as representational state transfer REST style services.

As referred to herein content may include any digital or non digital content. For example content may include any document image video graphic object portable document file PDF spreadsheet e.g. Microsoft Excel spreadsheet application other digital file or any other physical or digital content that may be stored for example using one or more servers such as server . Content may include a variety of associated information such as a data type associated with the content a date of creation of the content a date of most recent access or editing of the content information identifying an owner of the content information identifying one or more users with whom the content is shared information identifying one or more conditions on usage of the content and or one or more restrictions associated with sharing the content with other users information identifying one or more permissible operations relating to the content or any other information. Additionally as described herein performing an operation relating to a document may include any of accessing or opening the document editing the document sharing the document with other users electronically signing the document viewing the document sending the document for example in an email or other message or any other operation. While the following description is directed at the management of document content as an example implementation the systems and methods described herein may be used in the management of any other content types as described previously.

In some implementations the server may receive and or create documents. In some instances documents may be received at the server from one or more client devices where for example a user may upload one or more documents to the server using the client device . The server also may receive documents through other methods such as by receiving documents that are locally uploaded to the server or by receiving documents through a web interface via network . For example the server may be a remotely accessible server such as a server associated with a cloud computing service where documents may be provided to the server through a network . Additionally or alternatively the server may receive or create documents based on input received from client devices .

The server may present a suitable interface for the receiving and or creation of documents where applicable. For example the server may present a web interface through which a user can provide and or create documents through a web browser. In some implementations the server may be directly accessible via a graphical user interface or an application running on a device such as a client device . Any suitable interface can be used that enables the creation and storage of documents. In some instances one or more documents may be created by a particular user such as a user John Smith or Jane Doe as shown in . Additionally or alternatively documents can be created at the request of a user through a web based or other interface or through any suitable mechanism such as sending an email or short message service SMS transmission for example to an entity responsible for maintaining server . In some implementations a user may be able to create one or more documents by using an application running on a client device .

When a user creates stores or uploads a document at the server an association is established between the particular document and the user. In some implementations an association may be established between a credential associated with the user and the document where the association enables the user to continue to perform operations relating to the document such as the ability to access modify or perform other operations relating to the document. Additionally the association between the document stored at the server and the user enables the user to share the particular document with other users thereby providing the other users the capability to perform operations relating to the same document. Based on the user sharing a particular document with one or more other users associations can be established between the one or more other users and the particular document. According to some implementations establishing an association between the particular document and the one or more users with whom the document has been shared can include associating the particular document with credentials associated with the shared users.

A user with whom access to a particular document has been shared can subsequently request to perform operations relating to the document. In some instances the use of the shared document can be assigned one or more conditions to be satisfied in order for the user to be allowed to perform operations relating to the document and the system may determine whether the user s request satisfies the one or more conditions. Based on the one or more conditions being satisfied the system may enable the user to perform the requested operations relating to the document. For example based on the system determining that a user s request satisfies one or more conditions the system may provide the user with the document and may enable the user to edit the document.

As described documents that are received or created at server may have one or more conditions associated with the access to or usage of the documents and or the performance of operations related to the documents. Additionally or alternatively documents may have one or more restrictions associated with how it can be shared with users. A user such as a user who initially uploads stores or creates the document at the server may specify the one or more conditions and or restrictions associated with the content or alternatively the one or more conditions and or restrictions may be specified by another entity.

In some implementations a condition may require that a user obtain permission from a particular user or users to perform an operation related to a document. For example a second user may share a document with a first user and a condition placed on the usage of the document may require that that the first user obtain permission from the second user in order to perform an operation relating to the document. In some instances obtaining permission from the second user may include providing a verification mechanism a credential identifier or a user identifier associated with the second user to a client device associated with the first user . In some implementations such a mechanism or identifier may be for example any text or visual object signal or other identifier that is obtained directly from the second user or from a client device associated with the second user . By requiring the first user to directly obtain the permission from the second user or from a client device associated with the second user co location of the two users effectively may be enforced as a requirement for satisfying the particular permission.

A verification mechanism credential identifier or user identifier may include any of an alphanumeric code an encoded signal a quick response QR code or another form of identification data that may be provided by a first user at a client device associated with the first user . Based on the first user providing the mechanism or identifier associated with the second user the system may determine that the first user is in the presence of the second user and may authorize the first user to perform an operation relating to the document. For example the first user may request to perform an operation relating to a document and may submit the request to perform the operation as well as a verification mechanism credential identifier or user identifier associated with the second user at a client device associated with the first user . The request to perform the operation relating to the document and the identification data may be received by the server where the system may determine that the verification mechanism or credential identifier identifies the second user and therefore satisfies the condition associated with performing the operation on the document by the first user . Based on determining that the condition is satisfied the server may authorize performance of the operation relating to the document by the first user . In some instances authorizing the performance of the operation may include for example providing an indication to the client device associated with the first user and providing the document to the first user so that the first user may perform the operation.

In some instances a condition may require that a user with whom content has been shared obtain permission from a particular user a user who holds a particular credential and or a user who has a particular position. For example a document that contains a company s confidential financial data may have been shared with a user who is an employee of the company and usage of the document by the user may be conditioned on the user being in the presence of one or more individuals associated with the company s accounting department. In this example the user may demonstrate that they have permission to perform an operation on the document from another user who holds a particular credential e.g. a credential issued by the company identifying the user as a member of the company s accounting department or who holds a particular position e.g. accounting manager by providing at client device a credential identifier or user identifier held by the user . The credential identifier or user identifier may identify that the particular user holds the necessary credential or may identify the user as holding the particular position. Alternatively the first user may provide a verification mechanism to their client device where the verification mechanism may be a unique verification mechanism pertaining to the particular document or a verification mechanism output by a client device associated with the second user that uniquely identifies the second user . For example a verification mechanism credential identifier or user identifier encoded as an alphanumeric code an encoded signal barcode or quick response QR code may encode information relevant to the particular credential or the particular position that the user holds and the processing system may determine that the user identifier contains information that satisfies the condition or requirement demanding that the user be in the presence of a user having the credential or holding the position to perform an operation relating to the content. In some implementations the particular verification mechanism credential identifier or user identifier may be output at a client device associated with a user that has the particular credential or holds the position to perform the operation and the first user may obtain the verification mechanism credential identifier or user identifier using their own client device . The verification mechanism credential identifier or user identifier obtained at the client device may then be processed by the server to determine whether the condition on performing operations on the document are satisfied. Since providing the verification mechanism credential identifier or user identifier may involve providing a mechanism or identifier presented at a client device associated with the second user to a client device associated with the first user in some implementations the permission requirement may further be understood as effectively requiring the first user to demonstrate that they are in the presence of a second user that is able to give permission for the user to perform an operation relating to the document.

As described the verification mechanism credential identifier or user identifier may take the form of an alphanumeric code an encoded signal a QR or other optical machine readable representation or another form.

As referred to herein an alphanumeric code may be a sequence of numbers and or letters e.g. 4 to 24 characters that is associated with a verification mechanism credential identifier or user identifier such as a user that shares content with another user . In some instances a given numeric representation will only be valid for a certain time period. In operation applications for generating and providing an alphanumeric code may operate on client devices or server . The server may associate an alphanumeric code with a particular user or with particular documents such as documents . When a user presents an alphanumeric code the server can validate the alphanumeric code and can indicate whether the presented alphanumeric code matches a valid alphanumeric code at the time it is presented e.g. a valid alphanumeric code corresponding to a particular verification mechanism credential or user related to the usage of the document.

As referred to herein an optical machine readable representation may be an arrangement of graphical elements that encode alphanumeric data where the elements are arranged so that the data can be read by an optical scanner. For example an optical machine readable representation may be a bar code a quick response QR code or an Aztec code among other optical machine readable representations. The optical machine readable representations may encode data including or representing user identifiers content identifiers or any other suitable data.

A client device or server may use any suitable technique for encoding the optical machine readable representation. For example a client device may call a function or library routine that encodes a quick response QR code in accordance with the quick response QR code International Organization for Standardization ISR standard ISO IEC 18004 2006 RSS Information technology Automatic identification and data capture techniques QR Code 2005 bar code symbology specification.

When a client device reads an optical machine readable representation the client device or server can decode the optical machine readable representation to generate a set of alphanumeric characters that were encoded in the representation.

The client device and or server may use any suitable mechanism to scan and decode the optical machine readable representation. For example client device or server may access a function or library routine that decodes quick response QR codes or other optical machine readable representations of a validation mechanism credential identifier or user identifier. The server can then validate the optical machine readable representation by analyzing data corresponding to the alphanumeric characters that were encoded in the representation. In response the server may provide a response indicating whether the presented optical machine readable representation corresponds to an acceptable mechanism or identifier for performing operations relating to the particular document.

As described herein an encoded signal may be any signal modified to carry data. In some implementations an encoded signal may be a sound signal where the sound signal may be an oscillation of pressure waves transmitted through the air that are modulated to encode information. Any suitable modulation scheme can be used such as for example frequency shift keying FSK or phase shift keying PSK . In some implementations the sound signal may be in the ultrasonic frequency range e.g. greater than about 20 kHz. In such implementations the sound signal may be referred to as an ultrasonic signal or an ultrasonic code. In some implementations the sound signal may be in the audible frequency range e.g. about 20 Hz to about 20 kHz.

The signal may encode data including or representing verification mechanisms credential identifiers user identifiers or any other suitable data. In addition the signal may optionally encode other information that is linked to or otherwise associated with the document for example one or more conditions and or restrictions associated with the document. The signal may be encoded using any suitable technique. For example the signal may be a sound signal and may be encoded using a call function or library routine that encodes data into sound signals such as the Zoosh SDK by Naratte Inc. A client device can then output the sound signal from a speaker coupled to the client device for reception by another client device for example as a step in demonstrating that a user has permission to perform operations relating to a particular document. Alternatively the signal may be a near field communication NFC signal that may be communicated between two client devices or any another encoded signal such as an encoded signal transmitted using the Bluetooth standard.

When the signal is received a component of the system can perform operations to decode the signal to generate a set of alphanumeric characters that were encoded in the signal. For example a client device may use any suitable mechanism to receive and decode the sound signal. The client device can then transmit the signal to the server where the server can then validate the alphanumeric characters encoded in the signal. The server can generate and transmit a response to the client device indicating that the alphanumeric characters encoded in the signal correspond to a valid verification mechanism credential identifier or user identifier associated with the content item and based on determining that the encoded alphanumeric characters correspond to a valid user identifier may permit operations to be performed relating to the document.

In some implementations a location based condition may be associated with performing an operation relating to a document. For example a user may be required to be located within a certain geographic location within a certain distance of a particular geographic location or within a certain distance of another user to be authorized to perform an operation relating to a particular document. In some implementations determining whether a user satisfies a geographic condition may involve obtaining location information from a client device associated with a user.

A location based condition may specify for example one or more locations such as commercial buildings geographic regions particular rooms in a building large venues private residences or any other physical space where a user may be required to be located to perform an operation relating to a document. In some implementations the location or locations may be stored as for example points identified by a latitude coordinate and a longitude coordinate e.g. 38.915530 77.220604 polygons whose boundaries are defined by a set of latitude and longitude coordinate pairs e.g. 38.910000 77.220000 38.810000 77.220000 38.810000 77.120000 38.910000 77.12000 street addresses e.g. 100 Main Street Washington D.C. etc.

To determine a current location of a client device the client devices may use global positioning system GPS coordinates or other geographic location methods for example Wi Fi access point triangulation data cellular network triangulation data or IP address information when the client devices have network connectivity. In some implementations the system may require that the client device associated with a requesting user be connected to a particular network e.g. a specific Wi Fi network or cellular base station this is associated with a geographic location or region where performing the operation relating to the content is valid. Based on receiving the location of a client device the system for example the server can compare the current geographic location of the device with any geographic conditions associated with the particular document.

In some implementations a location may be associated with an indication of a predefined distance from the location e.g. 1000 yards that may be used for example by a client device associated with the user to determine if the user is located at the location. In such an instance a user may be determined to be located at the location if the geographic location of the user s client device is determined to be anywhere within the predefined distance from the location. For example a location may be an office building and a user may be identified as satisfying a location based condition associated with a document based on the user s client device being identified as within a range of 1000 yards of the office building. In some instances a location based condition can be stored as any suitable data object such as for example an eXtensible Markup Language XML or JavaScript Object Notation JSON object.

In other implementations a location based condition may be associated with a predefined distance between two users such as a predefined distance between a first user with whom a document has been shared and a second user that shared the document with the first user . For example a location relating to each user may be obtained by accessing location information at a client device associated with each user and a distance between the two locations may be determined. Based on the distance between the two locations the system may determine whether the distance between the two users satisfies the location based condition that the first user be within a predetermined range e.g. 500 yards of the second user in order to perform the operation relating to the document.

In some implementations a condition associated with performing an operation relating to a document may be a temporal condition. A temporal condition may identify for example a time period or multiple time periods during which performing an operation relating to the document is permissible. The time periods may be identified using any suitable format including for example a specific date or range of dates and times e.g. from Jan. 1 2013 at 9 00 AM to Jan. 31 2013 at 5 00 PM an expiration date and time e.g. before 5 00 PM on Jan. 15 2013 or a recurring day or days e.g. every Monday through Friday between 9 00 AM and 5 00 PM . The time periods may be stored in any suitable format. For example a specific date or range of dates and times may include a pair of dates with associated times a starting date with an associated time plus a duration or a pair of times since epoch. An expiration date and time could be identified by a date and time or a time since epoch. A recurring day and time could be represented as days of the week e.g. using cron format with Sunday through Saturday represented by integers 0 through 6 and times e.g. in 12 hour format such as 9 00 AM to 5 00 PM or in 24 hour format such as 0900 to 1700 . In some implementations the temporal condition could be stored as any suitable data object such as for example an XML or JSON object. Determining whether a request by a user to perform an operation relating to a document satisfies a temporal condition may involve determining a current time using an internal clock associated with a client device . For example based on receiving a request from a first user to perform an operation relating to a document a current time at the client device associated with the first user may be determined by accessing a current time as determined by an internal clock associated with the client device and determining at the client device whether the current time satisfies the temporal condition. Additionally or alternatively a time associated with a request to perform an operation on a document may be obtained by accessing a clock external to a client device such as a clock associated with the server and determining based on the current time and at the server whether the request satisfies a temporal condition associated with the document.

Conditions associated with performing an operation relating to a document may include combinations of the aforementioned conditions. For example performing an operation relating to a document may be associated with a condition that is a combination of a location based and a temporal condition a combination of a temporal condition and a condition requiring the permission of a second user or a combination of a location based condition and a condition requiring the permission of a second user. Furthermore the conditions associated with performing an operation relating to a document may change depending upon other factors such as a current location or time. For example performing an operation relating to a document may be permissible during certain time periods at one location and at different time periods at a different location. As another example a user may be permitted to perform certain operations relating to a document during certain time periods when the user has received permission from a particular second user and the user may be permitted to perform certain other operations relating to the document at different time periods when the user has received permission from a different second user.

The different examples of conditions that may be required to be satisfied before the performance of operations relating to documents is enabled e.g. location based temporal or permission based may apply to the sharing of content by one user with another user. For example a first user may only be allowed to share a particular document with a second user when the first user has received permission from a third user for example the user that shared the document with the first user. Additionally or alternatively a user only may be permitted to share a document with another user at a particular time or within a particular range of times or when the user is located at a particular location or within a predetermined range of a particular location. Furthermore conditions placed on the sharing of documents with other users may include combinations of the described conditions such as for example a combination of one or more temporal location based or permission based restrictions.

Once a document has been received or created and stored by the server associations between the document and one or more users may be established. Such an association between a user and a document may be based for instance on the user having created the document uploaded the document to the server and or based on any other action or rationale.

Associations also may be established between a document and one or more users to reflect that the document has been shared with the one or more users by another user. For example a user associated with a document may identify one or more users with whom to share the document and the system may establish an association between the document and the one or more users that reflects that the document has been shared with the one or more users. Associating the document with one or more particular users may include providing information relating to the document to server where the information may identify the document as being associated with the one or more particular users and may further identify the one or more particular users as users with whom the document is being shared. A document that has been stored at the server may be made accessible to one or more users with whom the document is associated. In some instances when one or more conditions have been imposed on a user s ability to perform an operation relating to a document the document may be made accessible to the user after the conditions on the user s ability to perform operations relating to the document have been satisfied. Making the document accessible to a user may involve providing the document to a client device such as client device associated with a user using a network such as network .

Based on receiving a request to perform an operation relating to a particular document the system may determine whether one or more conditions relating to the document are satisfied and may authorize performing the operation. If the request provided by the user is a request to view transmit edit or otherwise modify the document the system may enable the user to perform the operation by providing the user with the document at a client device associated with the user. In some instances providing the document to the client device associated with the user may involve enabling the client device to access and or perform operations relating to the document while the document is maintained on the server . In other instances the server may provide the content to the client device for example by transmitting a file containing the document through a network to the client device associated with the user and may receive and store an updated version of the document from the client device after the user has performed the operation relating to the document. In some implementations the client device associated with the user may automatically return the updated version of the document to the server for storage based on certain conditions being met to enable the system to better ensure that the user is performing operations on the document while in compliance with any conditions on the document s use. For example a condition may specify a predetermined period of time that begins when the document is provided to the user and upon the period of time elapsing the system may send the updated version of the document to the server for storage. Additionally in some instances after the document has been provided to the requesting user the system may continue to monitor whether the use of the document is in compliance with any conditions associated with the document. For example if a document is associated with a permission based or location based condition the system may continuously monitor a location of a client device associated with the requesting user and or the location of a client device associated with the user that provided permission to the requesting user to enable the system to determine whether the user is still in compliance with the conditions on the document while the user is performing the requested operations.

In other implementations a client device such as client device associated with a user may receive a document that has been associated with the user and may store the document in any suitable memory for later retrieval. For example a user may request to perform an operation relating to a particular document associated with the user and the system may determine that the request satisfies one or more conditions on usage of the document by the user. In response to determining that the request to perform an operation relating to the document is permissible the system may authorize the usage of the document by the user and may provide the document to a client device associated with the user. The client device associated with the user may store the document and may enable the user to access and or perform operations relating to the document at a later time in some instances based on the user satisfying the one or more conditions on the usage of the document at that later time.

According to the example illustrated in the sharing of a particular content may involve a number of processes. For example a user John Smith having a client device may request to share particular document Meeting Notes with another user to enable the other user to perform operations relating to the particular document . To share the document with another user the user John Smith may access an interface displayed at client device where the interface may enable the user to select the particular document that the user would like to share. For example the user may be presented with a listing of documents Shared by Me that includes documents that the user has or is sharing with other users. The user may select a particular document Meeting Notes from among the listing and may additionally identify one or more users with whom to share the document . In some instances selecting a user with whom to share document may involve selecting the user from among a list of potential users performing a query for a particular user on a database of potential users or any other method that may enable the user to select another user. Additionally the user may specify one or more conditions to be placed on the ability of the user s with whom the document is shared to perform operations relating to the shared document.

Responsive to the user John Smith initiating a request to share the particular document Meeting Notes with one or more users the server may share the document with the one or more users for example user Joe Boggs. Additionally the server may associate the document with the one or more conditions and or restrictions identified by the user to associate with the shared document. In some implementations based on the user being compliant with the one or more restrictions on sharing the document data identifying the particular document and the one or more users to share the document with may be transmitted through a network and received at a server . Based on the data the server may associate the document with the user for example by modifying information associated with the document stored on the server to identify the user as a user with whom the document is shared. Additionally the server may modify the information associated with the document on the server to indicate the one or more conditions associated with usage of the document by the user .

After the document Meetings Notes has been shared with the user Joe Boggs by the user John Smith the user Joe Boggs may be able to access and perform other operations relating to the shared document for example by using a client device associated with the user. For example the user may access an interface on client device where the interface may include a listing of documents Shared with Me that includes one or more documents that have been shared with the user . To perform operations relating to a particular document shared with the user the user may select the particular document from among the one or more documents such as the document Meeting Notes. 

However before the user is permitted to access the shared document or otherwise perform an operation relating to the shared document the server may determine that the shared document is associated with one or more conditions such as for example a location based permission based or temporal condition. For example as illustrated in the server may determine that the document Meeting Notes is associated with a permission based condition that requires the user to receive permission from a particular user or users prior to being able to perform operations relating to the particular document. As shown in the interface of the client device associated with the user obtaining permission to access the document Meeting Notes may involve obtaining a verification mechanism credential identifier or user identifier of a user that can provide the user with permission to perform the particular actions. As described previously such a mechanism or identifier may include a QR code where obtaining permission from the user may involve scanning the QR code using a client device associated with the user . In practice any number of other formats may be used for verification mechanisms credential identifiers or user identifiers including an alphanumeric code an encoded signal such as an encoded ultrasonic signal a Bluetooth signal a near field communication NFC or any number of other formats.

As shown in a user John Smith may be capable of providing the user Joe Boggs with permission to access the document Meeting Notes. To satisfy the permission based condition associated with the document Meeting Notes Joe Boggs may scan a QR code displayed at the client device associated with the user . For example the client device associated with the user may display the interface that includes a title identifying the user a picture of the user employee information of the user and a QR code that encodes information relating to a validation mechanism an identifier for a credential associated with the user and or an identifier for the user . The user may scan the QR code in accordance with the instructions presented on the interface for example by using a camera associated with the client device and the screen view . Responsive to obtaining the mechanism or identifier the client device associated with the user may decode the mechanism or identifier locally at the client device or may transmit the mechanism or identifier to the server for decoding. The decoded mechanism or identifier may then be analyzed by the server to determine whether the mechanism or identifier satisfies the permission based condition on accessing the document Meeting Notes by the user . For example the server may determine whether the decoded mechanism or identifier corresponds to a particular user or group of users that may provide the user with the permission to access the document Meeting Notes. Responsive to determining that the decoded mechanism or identifier corresponds to a particular user or group of users that may provide the user with the permission the server may enable the user to access the document Meeting Notes. As described above the server may enable the user to access the document through any of a variety of different mechanisms including by enabling the user to access the document stored at a server or transmitting a file containing the document Meeting Notes to the client device associated with the user .

Based on receiving the request to perform an operation relating to the document the system may access data identifying one or more conditions associated with the user performing the operation relating to the document . For example the server may access data associated with the particular content that identifies one or more conditions on the usage of the document by the user Joe Boggs. In some implementations server may access the data associated with the particular content based on the server receiving a request from a client device associated with the user Joe Boggs to perform an operation relating to the shared document Meeting Notes. 

The system evaluates the one or more conditions placed on the usage of the document by the user . The server may evaluate the one or more conditions identified at process step where evaluating the one or more conditions includes comparing data obtained with the request to one or more conditions and determining whether the conditions are satisfied. For example server may receive at the time of the request any relevant geographical location data time data credential identifier data user identifier data or other data such as from the client device associated with the requesting user and may compare the received data to the identified conditions to evaluate the conditions. Alternatively the system may identify the one or more conditions on the usage of the document by the user and may subsequently access data relevant to the identified conditions to evaluate the conditions.

Based on evaluating the one or more conditions the system determines that the operation can be performed on the particular document . For example the server may evaluate the one or more conditions and may determine that the one or more conditions are satisfied and therefore may determine that the operation relating to the document can be performed. Referring to the example the server may determine that the user Joe Boggs can perform an operation relating to the shared document Meeting Notes based on one or more permission based location based or temporal conditions selected by the user John Smith to associate with the shared document being satisfied.

Based on determining that the operation relating to the document may be performed the system may authorize the user to perform the operation on the document . For example the server may authorize the user Joe Boggs to perform an operation relating to the document Meeting Notes that has been shared with the user where providing the authorization may enable the user Joe Boggs to perform an operation relating to the document . In some instances authorizing the user to perform an operation relating to the document may involve providing an indication to the server identifying the user as authorized to perform the operation may involve providing a notification to the client device associated with the user indicating that the user is authorized to perform the operation relating to the document or may include performing any other operations such as providing the document to the client device associated with the user . In some instances providing a notification to the client device associated with the user may involve pushing a notification to the client device associated with the user or may involve providing any other notification for example a notification in an email or in an SMS transmission. Based on authorizing the user to perform the operation relating to the document the process ends where the user may then be able to perform operations relating to the particular document the operations being permissible operations identified by the user John Smith who shared with the document with the user Joe Boggs. 

Initially server receives one or more messages requesting to perform operations relating to a particular document from a client device associated with a first user . For example a message may be received at the server requesting to access a particular document. In some instances the message may be transmitted from client device to the server where the messages received at the server may identify the request the user associated with the request as well as the document identified with the request in addition to other information. In some instances the particular document is a document that is stored on the server and that has been shared with the first user by a second user.

The server determines one or more conditions associated with the first user performing operations relating to the document identified in the request . In some instances determining the one or more messages may be performed in response to receiving the request from the client device to perform operations relating to the particular document.

The server may send one or more messages to the client device associated with the first user requesting that the first user provide information to satisfy the one or more identified conditions . Messages requesting that the first user satisfy the one or more conditions may be sent from the server and over a network to the client device associated with the first user. In response to receiving one or more messages requesting information that satisfies the one or more conditions on performing the requested operation relating to the particular document the client device or a user using the client device may obtain information that potentially satisfies the one or more conditions.

In some instances the conditions may include for example a condition that the first user associated with the client device must obtain permission from another user associated with the particular document prior to performing the requested operation on the particular document. In such an instance one or more messages may be transmitted between client device associated with the first user and a client device associated with a second user that can provide the first user with permission to perform the operation relating to the particular document. For example the client device associated with the second user may transmit a validation mechanism credential identifier or a user identifier to the client device associated with the first user as a means of providing permission to the first user to perform the operation relating to the document. In some implementations such a message may be transmitted by the client device in response to receiving a request from the client device for a form of permission enabling the client device to perform the operation relating to the particular document.

The client device associated with the first user may submit information related to satisfying the one or more conditions on performing operations relating to the particular document to the server . For example if the conditions included obtaining permission from a second user associated with the particular document prior to being able to perform operations relating to the document the client device may transmit to the server data associated with receiving the permission that was obtained from the client device associated with the second user. Thus the client device may transmit data associated with a verification mechanism credential identifier or user identifier to the server . Additionally or alternatively such messages may include indications of a location of the user device locations of a user device associated with the first user and of a user device associated with a second user a current time or any other information relevant to satisfying the one or more conditions.

Based on the message received from the client device containing information relevant to the one or more conditions on the usage of the particular document by the first user associated with the client device the server may evaluate the one or more conditions . Evaluating the conditions as described may involve comparing the data received in messages to the one or more identified conditions. Evaluating the conditions may be performed internally at the server for example by accessing information stored on one or more memory units associated with the server and evaluating the conditions using one or more processors associated with the sever .

After evaluating the one or more conditions associated with the particular content the server may send one or more messages to the client device indicating whether the performing of the operation relating to the document has been authorized . For example the processing system may evaluate the one or more conditions may determine that the one or more conditions are satisfied and based on determining that the one or more conditions are satisfied may output one or more messages to client device . In some instances the one or more messages may include a notification pushed to the client device notifying the first user that they are authorized to perform the requested operations relating to the identified document such as a requested operation to access the particular document. The one or more messages may also include messages to the client device that may enable the client device to perform the operations relating to the particular document for example one or more messages that may include a file containing the particular document or one or more messages that include a link that the first user can use to perform operations relating to the particular document on the server . illustrates an example process for enabling a user to share a particular document with another user. In some implementations the steps of process may be performed at a server such as a server . As shown the system may receive a request to share a particular document . The request may be performed at a client device such as a client device associated with a user and may be received at a server . For example a user John Smith may request to share a particular document Meeting Notes with another user Joe Boggs and may submit the request at a client device associated with the user .

Additionally when requesting to share a particular document a user may identify one or more conditions to associate with usage of the shared document by the user with whom the document will be shared . Conditions may include one or more location based one or more temporal conditions or one or more permission based conditions. In practice the one or more identified conditions may be received at the server in the same way that the server may receive the request to share the particular document at process step . For example the user John Smith after requesting to share the document Meeting Notes with another user Joe Boggs may additionally identify one or more location based temporal or permission based conditions to apply to the usage of the document by the user Joe Boggs. 

The system may evaluate the one or more conditions associated with performing operations on the document . For example the server may obtain information relevant to the one or more conditions identified at process step and may evaluate the one or more conditions to determine if the request to share the particular document complies with the one or more conditions. Evaluating the restrictions may involve accessing geographic location data temporal data verification mechanism credential or user identifier data e.g. an alphanumeric code encoded signal or quick response QR or other optical computer readable code or other information relating to the one or more conditions. In some instances accessing such data may involve accessing the data at a client device associated with the user requesting to share the content or may include accessing data at another location. For example the server may access geographic temporal verification mechanism credential identifier user identifier or other data at a client device associated with a user John Smith and may use the accessed data to evaluate one or more conditions placed on the usage of the particular document by the user . In some instances evaluating the one or more conditions may involve comparing the accessed data to one or more conditions at the server . For example the server may evaluate if a geographic location of the client device associated with the user is within a particular region where the sharing of the content is allowed may evaluate whether a current time satisfies a condition on when the content may be shared or may determine whether a verification mechanism credential identifier or user identifier information corresponds to a particular mechanism or identifier that is required to demonstrate permission to share the content .

Based on the evaluation of the one or more conditions the system may determine that the request to share the content satisfies the conditions . For instance the server may after evaluating the one or more conditions at processing step as described determine that the request to share the particular content complies with one or more of the conditions and or may determine that the request does not satisfy one or more of the conditions. For example the server may determine that the request provided by user John Smith to share the particular document Meeting Notes complies with one or more location based temporal or permission based requirements limiting how the user John Smith can share the particular document .

The system may share the particular document with the particular user identified by the sharing user and may place the one or more conditions on the usage of the document . The one or more conditions may be associated with the usage of the document by the particular user with whom the document has been shared. In some instances the sharing of the particular document may be authorized based on determining that the request to share the document satisfies all of the one or more conditions on the usage of the document where failing to comply with one or more of the conditions may restrict the document from being shared with the identified user. In practice sharing the content with the particular user may involve modifying information associated with the particular document on a server . For example the information may be modified to indicate the particular user with whom the document has been shared may indicate one or more conditions on the usage of the document by the particular user may indicate the user who shared the item with the particular user or may indicate any other information. For example upon determining that the request by the user John Smith to share the particular document Meeting Notes complies with all of the restrictions limiting how the document can be shared the system may share the document with the user Joe Boggs. This may be achieved by modifying information associated with the document Meeting Notes on a server to indicate that the user Joe Boggs has been shared the document that one or more conditions apply to the usage of the document by the user Joe Boggs that the document was shared with the user Joe Boggs by the user John Smith and may be modified to indicate any other information. In some instances sharing the document with the particular user may also involve providing one or more notifications to users indicating that the particular document has been shared. For example one or more notifications may be pushed to client devices associated with users indicating that the particular document has been successfully shared. Additionally or alternatively the one or more notifications may indicate other information such as one or more conditions on usage of the document by the user or any other information.

The data structure includes a first column for a content identifier that uniquely identifies the particular content and a second column for a content type associated with the content. In some implementations the content identifier may be represented by a name by an alphanumeric string or by an identification number and the content type may any of a number of different content types as described previously. The data structure may include a third column indicating a user that created or uploaded the content item to the serve and a fourth column indicating one or more users with whom the particular content item has been shared. The data structure includes a fifth column that may indicate one or more operations that the user s with whom the content item has been shared may perform on the shared content item. The data structure may include a sixth column indicating one or more conditions on performing operations relating to the shared content item by the user s with whom the content item has been shared. The example data structure indicates a first record that references a content item named Meeting Notes. The content item named Meeting Notes is identified as a spreadsheet such as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet file or other spreadsheet object or file. The record indicates that the content item was created or uploaded to the server by the user John Smith. The record indicates that the user John Smith has shared the content item Meeting Notes with another user Joe Boggs and indicates that the user with whom the content item has been shared is permitted to perform various operations on the particular content item including viewing editing and sharing the content item Meeting Notes subject to any conditions imposed on the ability to perform such operations as specified in column for record . In this case column for record specifies that the user Joe Boggs with whom the content item has been shared must receive permission from John Smith before being permitted to perform any such operations.

The example data structure also includes a record associated with a content item named Contract where the content item may be a contract that is stored in a portable document format PDF . The content may be a content item that has been created or uploaded to the server by a user Jane Doe. The content may be shared with another user Joe Boggs as illustrated previously with respect to and the user Joe Boggs may be able to view the content based on the user receiving permission from the user Jane Doe. As described receiving permission to view the content item Contract may involve providing a validation mechanism credential identifier or user identifier associated with the user Jane Doe such as an alphanumeric code encoded signal or quick response QR code that identifies that the requesting user has received permission to view the PDF Contract. 

Record of data structure relates to a content that is a letter to a client and is a document. For example the content related to record may be a Microsoft Word document a rich text format document or may be a document that uses any other acceptable document format. The content item has been created or uploaded by a user John Smith and the record indicates that the content has been shared with a user Joe Boggs. The record further indicates that the user that has been shared the content is permitted to perform operations relating to the content of viewing the content and electronically signing the content. Three conditions are placed on the usage of the content by the user Joe Boggs in that the user may only perform operations relating to the content up until Dec. 31 2013 may only perform operations relating to the content when located within the United States of America and must receive permission prior to being able to perform the operations relating to the content.
