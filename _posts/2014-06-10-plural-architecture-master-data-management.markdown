This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 070 029 entitled PLURAL ARCHITECTURE MASTER DATA MANAGEMENT and filed Nov. 1 2013 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Present invention embodiments relate to data management and more specifically to master data management utilizing a combination of registry and centralized type architectures.

Master Data Management MDM hubs have provided two approaches for the management of master data. Master data typically includes information pertaining to the operation of a business e.g. customers products employees materials suppliers etc. and is generally stored in different data sources across that business. Each management approach addresses different implementation styles delineated primarily on the location where the ownership and management of master data occurs.

In a registry style or virtual master data management approach source systems are the systems of record for providing master data and changes to the master data are made through these existing source systems. A virtual master data management system gets loaded with records from the source systems that are associated with entities e.g. person corporation company organization business etc. and determines similar or matching records that are associated with the same entity. The virtual master data management system stores only enough information to match and provide linkages between the similar and matching records for each of the entities. A trusted view of this information for an entity is subsequently provided to a user on demand from data within the source systems. Since a single view of an entity is not persisted to storage of the virtual master data management system modifications to master data are made via the source systems.

In a centralized style or physical master data management approach master data from source systems is loaded into a single repository of a physical master data management system and all information relevant to providing a single view of an entity is stored in that repository. Matching and collapsing of records across the source systems are performed and a single view of the entity is typically persisted in the repository. The physical master data management system becomes the system of record for managing master data from that point forward.

However these master data management styles are not always sufficient and do not always fully accommodate the breadth of master data management requirements that commonly evolve over time with the growth and adoption of master data management techniques in support of the data governance strategies within an enterprise. This typically results in the proliferation and attempts to federate multiple master data management MDM hubs of the different styles thereby incurring additional integration complexity maintenance costs and version alignment of supporting software.

According to one embodiment of the present invention a system for managing data within a plurality of data management architectures comprises at least one processor. The system persists an entity managed by a first data management architecture to a second data management architecture. The first data management architecture manages entity data within one or more data sources while the second data management architecture manages persisted entities with data from the one or more data sources within a common repository. A modification to data of the persisted entity is detected within the one or more data sources and the modified data is synchronized with the persisted entity in the repository of the second data management architecture. Embodiments of the present invention further include a method and computer program product for managing data within a plurality of data management architectures in substantially the same manner described above.

Present invention embodiments manage master data in registry or virtual centralized or physical and co existence styles within a common platform and provide a framework for implementing style agnostic services that facilitate the management of information stored according to each of these styles. Master data typically includes information pertaining to operation of a business e.g. customers products employees materials suppliers etc. and is generally stored in different data sources across that business. However present invention embodiments may manage any type of data pertaining to any type of objects e.g. business or other entities or organizations animate or inanimate objects etc. .

A single application programming interface API enables the style of master data management e.g. registry or virtual centralized or physical etc. to be transparent to a service consumer. A subset of entity attributes is synchronized across the styles and seamless movement of master data records and or more granular data attributes from one style of management to another is performed typically from the registry style to the centralized and or co existence styles within the common platform. Master data records from a registry style system may be moved to a centralized style system in accordance with a set of rule based criteria e.g. size of entity membership data completeness etc. .

Present invention embodiments significantly reduce the need to federate out to multiple independent master data management MDM systems in order to ascertain a complete picture of master data managed in different styles e.g. registry and centralized styles . Further present invention embodiments enable seamless movement of information from one master data management style to another thereby avoiding significant extract transform load ETL efforts to move data from one system to another. Moreover as the style of master data management changes over time the application programming interfaces APIs used to access information remain the same.

An example computing environment for use with present invention embodiments is illustrated in . Specifically computing environment includes a master data management server system one or more client or end user systems and one or more data sources . The data sources may be implemented by any conventional or other storage structures or systems e.g. server systems databases file systems etc. that contain records with master data pertaining to various entities e.g. person corporation company organization business etc. . However data sources may contain any type of data pertaining to any type of objects e.g. business or other entities or organizations animate or inanimate objects etc. .

Master data management server system client systems and data sources may be remote from each other and communicate over a network . The network may be implemented by any number of any suitable communications media e.g. wide area network WAN local area network LAN Internet Intranet etc. . Alternatively master data management server system client systems and data sources may be local to each other and communicate via any appropriate local communication medium e.g. local area network LAN hardwire wireless link Intranet etc. .

Master data management server system provides a plural architecture master data management system including a virtual or registry type master data management system and a physical or centralized master data management system . Client systems enable users to provide information to master data management server system to configure load and or query the plural architecture master data management system. In particular the master data management server system includes virtual master data management system with virtual master data management system modules physical master data management system with physical master data management system modules a request processing framework and an entity management module . Virtual master data management system modules implement virtual master data management system . In this type of system data sources provide and maintain master data and changes to the master data are made through these data sources. The virtual master data management system modules process records from data sources to determine records associated with the same entity e.g. person corporation company organization business etc. and store only enough information to match and provide linkages between similar and matching records from the data sources for the various entities.

Virtual master data management system modules include a matching and linking engine to process records from the data sources and determine records associated with the same entity e.g. person corporation company organization business etc. . The determined records for an entity are linked and this linkage information is stored and maintained by matching and linking engine . The records for an entity may be matched based on any conventional or other suitable matching or partial matching techniques e.g. a quantity of the same or similar fields matching scores probabilistic matching etc. .

Queries may be provided directly to the virtual master data management system from users applications using the same APIs for virtual owned data whose view is not fully persisted in the physical master data management system. In this case a trusted view of entity information may be provided on demand by the virtual master data management system by utilizing the linking information to obtain records associated with the entity from the various data sources. Alternatively the virtual master data management system may process queries for entities received by services of the physical master data management system as described below.

Physical master data management system modules implement a centralized or physical master data management system. In this type of system master data from data sources is loaded into a single repository and all information relevant to providing a single view of an entity is stored in that repository. Matching and collapsing of records across the data sources are performed and a single view of an entity is persisted in the repository. Once the data is loaded in the repository the data is utilized to process requests e.g. updates queries etc. or may be associated with information from another domain e.g. product account etc. that is being centrally managed. The virtual and physical master data management systems may be implemented by any conventional or other registry and or centralized master data management systems e.g. virtual and physical master data management systems of IBM INFOSPHERE Master Data Management MDM etc. .

A database system may store various information for the data management e.g. serve as the repository for the physical master data management system metadata data models of the virtual and physical master data management systems mapping and linking information etc. . The database system may be implemented by any conventional or other database or storage unit may be local to or remote from master data management server system and may communicate via any appropriate communication medium e.g. local area network LAN wide area network WAN Internet hardwire wireless link Intranet etc. . The client systems may present a graphical user e.g. GUI etc. or other interface e.g. command line prompts menu screens etc. to solicit information from users pertaining to the data management and may provide reports including results e.g. query results configuration information etc. .

Request processing framework receives and processes requests for master data stored within the plural architecture master data management system as described below. This framework may be implemented by any conventional or other framework for processing data management requests e.g. a request processing framework of IBM INFOSPHERE Master Data Management MDM etc. .

Entity management module enables utilization of the virtual and physical master data management systems for data management and controls movement access and retrieval of master data within these data management systems as described below. The entity management module includes an entity event notification module and a services module . The entity event notification module provides notification of a modification to an entity within data sources as described below. The entity event notification module also provides extension capability so that business rules can be implemented to conditionally persist the entity view in physical MDM. That is metrics could be taken to establish whether the content of a view is complete or clean enough to persist that view in physical MDM. This can be evaluated calculated and a decision made in the event notification component. The services module provides various services for the plural architecture master data management system e.g. persisting entities querying entities etc. as described below. The entity management module may be external of or fully or partially reside within the virtual master data management and physical master data management systems in any fashion. For example event notification module may reside within virtual master data management system modules while services module may reside within physical master data management system modules .

Master data management server system client system and data sources may be implemented by any conventional or other computer systems preferably equipped with a display or monitor a base e.g. including at least one processor one or more memories and or internal or external network interfaces or communications devices e.g. modem network cards etc. optional input devices e.g. a keyboard mouse or other input device and any commercially available and custom software e.g. server communications software virtual master data management system modules matching and linking engine physical master data management system modules request processing framework entity management module entity event notification module services module browser interface software etc. .

The modules of master data management server system e.g. virtual master data management system modules matching and linking engine physical master data management system modules request processing framework entity management module entity event notification module services module etc. may include one or more modules or units to perform the various functions of present invention embodiments described below. The various modules e.g. virtual master data management system modules matching and linking engine physical master data management system modules request processing framework entity management module entity event notification module services module etc. may be implemented by any combination of any quantity of software and or hardware modules or units and may reside within memory of the master data management server system for execution by processor .

Present invention embodiments may accommodate various scenarios employing virtual and physical master data management systems to manage master data. For example master data may be currently managed in a virtual master data management system but eventually some master data attributes are desired to be managed in a physical master data management system as illustrated in . Present invention embodiments enable the entity to be persisted from the virtual to the physical master data management system. By way of example an entity is managed by virtual master data management system provided by master data management server system . The entity includes several data records from various data sources that are linked and is associated with an entity identification to uniquely identify the entity within the virtual master data management system.

The entity may be persisted to physical master data management system provided by master data management server system . In this case a party identification is generated for uniquely identifying the entity or party within the physical master data management system and mapped to entity identification . The entity may be persisted in a registration mode where link information for the entity may be persisted in the physical master data management system. The link information is utilized to retrieve the entity records from the virtual master data management system. Alternatively the entity may be persisted in a fully persisted mode where the records for the entity are centrally stored in a repository of the physical master data management system e.g. database system . In this case the records for the persisted entity or party may be retrieved from the centrally stored data.

Various services are provided e.g. by entity management module that access the virtual and or physical master data management systems to provide data in response to queries. Once the entity is persisted in the physical master data management system client applications may be developed without having to face significant rework by leveraging centrally managed persisted attributes.

Another example scenario accommodated by present invention embodiments includes enhancing performance. For example virtual master data management system is initially employed. However performance degradation occurs in response to retrieving some entities due to a large number of records or members e.g. thousands etc. that belong to those entities. Retrieval may be enhanced by persisting a view of these large entities within physical master data management system .

Yet another example scenario accommodated by present invention embodiments includes conditional persistence. For example virtual master data management system is initially employed to manage and store entities. However views of these entities may be conditionally persisted within physical master data management system based on various criteria. By way of example views of entities may be conditionally persisted in response to satisfying pre configured or user specified data characteristics e.g. surpassing a particular level of data completeness or data quality etc. .

A flow diagram of plural architecture data management system is illustrated in . Initially master data management server system provides virtual master data management and physical master data management systems e.g. via virtual master data management and physical master data management system modules as described above. Data can be created and or managed using a single set of services in either data sources e.g. via the virtual master data management system or in a repository e.g. database system that is centrally managed e.g. via the physical master data management system .

Initially linking and matching engine of virtual master data management system receives and processes records of master data from various data sources and determines records associated with the same entity e.g. person corporation company organization business etc. . The determined records for an entity are linked and this linkage information is stored and maintained by matching and linking engine within virtual master data management system .

Since master data is generally stored in different data sources the master data may be duplicated and inconsistent. Thus once records for the entities are matched and linked a plurality of views may exist for the same entity with varying data. Accordingly a view for an entity is selected e.g. by a user or automatically and may be persisted to the repository of the physical master data management system e.g. database system via services e.g. persistEntity etc. provided by services module of entity management module . A party identification is generated for uniquely identifying the persisted entity or party within the physical master data management system and mapped to an entity identification for the virtual master data management system. This associates the entity of the virtual master data management system with the corresponding party in the physical master data management system. Further rules may be applied to conditionally persist certain entities based on a set of criteria e.g. completeness data quality of created entity view entity size e.g. number of members or records in the entity etc. .

A persisted entity or party may be represented in the physical master data management system in various manners. For example the entity may be persisted in a registration mode where a set of entity identifiers including an entity identification to identify the corresponding virtual representation e.g. the entity within the virtual master data management system and a corresponding set of unique record identifiers for the member records comprising the entity are stored in party records in the repository. The record identifiers uniquely identify a particular member record of an entity in a data source . The party records further include a status indicator that indicates the absence of a full persisted view of the entity in the repository of the physical master data management system.

The entity may further be persisted in a fully persisted mode where the selected view of the entity is stored in party records within the repository of the physical master data management system. The party records include the status indicator indicating that a persisted view of the entity is stored in the repository. The status indicator may include any suitable values to indicate the persistence mode. By way of example only a value of one indicates a registration mode of persistence while a value of two indicates a full persistence.

The status indicator enables the plural architecture master data management system to conditionally derive the entity view from the virtual master data management system or from a stored representation in the repository of the physical master data management system. This provides several advantages. For example generation of the selected view for large entities that include numerous e.g. thousands etc. member records may take a significant amount of time. However the time to retrieve this representation dramatically decreases by fully persisting the results of this view when first constructed. Further a single application programming interface API can be used to provide services to retrieve entities for consuming systems regardless of whether the entities are virtually managed or physically managed in the plural architecture master data management system. This enables generation of consuming client applications early in the data management process and as business needs evolve the same set of application programming interfaces APIs remain functional for both virtual and physical master data management.

As critical data e.g. used in matching and identifying duplicate records etc. changes in data sources or in the central repository of the physical master data management system entity event notification module of entity management module triggers the sharing of this information. For example a modification e.g. add update etc. to data or an entity within data sources may occur. Matching and linking engine matches and links records of the data sources in order to determine if the selected view of the entity has changed. If the selected view has changed entity event notification module triggers propagation of the modification to the persisted entity or party in the physical master data management system.

In the event data of a fully persisted entity or party is originally changed in the repository of the physical master data management system the modification may be propagated to data sources by the virtual master data management system via a notification mechanism that each of the source systems may subscribe to in order to consume the change consistently.

Queries for the plural architecture master data management system are received by request processing framework from client systems and handled by services module of entity management module . The services module provides various application programming interfaces APIs or services e.g. getParty getPerson getOrganization getPartyByAdminSysKey getPartyByEntityId etc. to retrieve data e.g. person entity etc. based on various criteria e.g. system keys entity identifications etc. . The queries may be applied directly against the repository when entities are fully persisted therein. However when a queried entity is persisted in a registration mode e.g. storage of entity identifiers the services module retrieves data for the queried entity from the virtual master data management system. In this case the virtual master data management system utilizes the set of entity identifiers for the entity stored in the repository in order to retrieve data from data sources and generate the selected view for the queried entity.

A manner of loading data from data sources into the plural architecture master data management system e.g. via master data management server system and virtual master data management system modules physical master data management system modules and entity management module is illustrated in . Initially configuration and other data are prepared at step . The preparation typically includes defining a data model for the virtual master data management system or virtual data model and mapping data fields or entity attributes of the virtual data model to corresponding data fields or party attributes of a data model of the physical master data management system or physical data model . The physical data model employs various business objects representing parties and party attributes while the virtual model is based on entities with entity attributes that may be mapped to the business objects. The virtual and physical data models are typically maintained in database tables of database system where the mapping provides associations between corresponding fields of database tables for entities and parties of the virtual and physical data models. The mapping may be initiated using a pre defined physical data model where the pre defined model may be expanded to accommodate varying data requirements.

The mapping between the virtual and physical models further indicates the attributes of parties of the physical data model defined as business keys. Business keys are used to determine uniqueness constraints of an attribute e.g. name address etc. within the selected view and are utilized to determine when an attribute is to be updated or created in the physical master data management system as described below. A business key for an attribute includes one or more fields that identify an attribute and provide uniqueness constraints for the selected view. For example a business key for a person name attribute may be the name usage type thereby providing one name per name type in the selected view. Alternatively the business key may be name type first name last name thereby providing more than one name per name type in the selected view if the first and last names are different.

In addition the mapping may include transcoding functions to enable values of certain data within the virtual data model to be converted to compatible values within the physical data model for persistence of that data within the physical master data management system. For example a gender attribute within the virtual data model may include values of 0 e.g. indicating female and 1 e.g. indicating male while a corresponding attribute of the physical data model may include values of F e.g. indicating female and M e.g. indicating male . The transcoding function converts the values of 0 and 1 within the virtual data model to the corresponding compatible values within the physical data model of F and M for persistence of that attribute within the physical master data management system.

Since master data is generally stored in different data sources the master data may be duplicated and inconsistent. Accordingly data cleansing and standardization e.g. provide a common format for data fields e.g. date time etc. processes may further be specified while a matching algorithm for associating member records of an entity may be defined and or selected. The matching algorithm assists with dc duplication of data from the data sources. The virtual and physical data models mapping cleansing standardization and matching may be pre configured into the plural architecture master data management system or entered by a user via a user interface.

Source records from data sources are loaded into the virtual master data management system e.g. via virtual master data management system modules and processed in accordance with the specified data cleansing and standardization at step . The source records are cross matched at step e.g. via matching and linking engine based on the specified matching algorithm to determine records associated with the same entity. Information linking member records to their associated entity is stored without storing the actual record data . Various conventional and other matching or partial matching techniques may be employed e.g. a quantity of the same or similar fields matching scores probabilistic matching etc. .

The resulting entities are registered with the physical master data management system e.g. via entity management module at step by persisting limited link information for the entities e.g. information to map the entity between the physical and virtual master data management systems . The registration may be configured to ascertain link and other information from various sources. For example link and other information may be obtained from a bulk cross matching process or from the matching and linking entity management service performed by the virtual master data management system.

Once the entities are registered the entities may be persisted to the physical master data management system e.g. via services module e.g. persistEntity service at step e.g. as described below for . Since master data is generally stored in different data sources the master data may be duplicated and inconsistent. Accordingly several views of an entity e.g. with varying data from data sources may be generated by the virtual master data management system. A user may select a desired view via a user interface to provide a composite view to be persisted or a generated view may be selected by the virtual master data management system via various criteria to provide the composite view for persistence.

Alternatively the registration may be configured to persist entities. In this case batch files are prepared and may be submitted for processing either automatically as part of the registration or manually. The batch files include an entity identification and entity type and may persist entities of a common or different entity types. In addition rules may be applied to conditionally persist certain entities based on a set of criteria e.g. completeness data quality of created entity view entity size e.g. number of members or records in the entity etc. .

Entities may be persisted in a registration mode or a full persistence mode. The information persisted for an entity in a registration mode includes the entity identification entity type data source identifiers and member record identifiers. The data for the entity remains within data sources and is retrieved by the virtual master data management system to generate the selected view. Full persistence mode maintains the persisted entity e.g. entity attributes and member records in the repository of the physical master data management system. Basically the entity is converted to a corresponding business object or party of the physical data model based on the mappings for persistence in the physical master data management system.

Once the desired entities are persisted in the physical master data management system the plural architecture master data management system maintains data integrity of persisted entities with data in the virtual master data management system. This is accomplished by synchronizing modifications to data in the virtual master data management system with the persisted view of the entity in the physical master data management system. A manner of synchronizing data of the virtual master data management system with corresponding persisted entity views e.g. via master data management server system and virtual master data management system modules physical master data management system modules and entity management module is illustrated in . Initially the virtual master data management system receives data modifications e.g. updates additions deletions link alterations of records etc. at step . The modifications may include modifications e.g. addition deletion updates etc. to data within data sources and or modifications to links of records forming an entity e.g. a record of an entity may be modified to link the record with another entity . Matching and linking engine matches and links records of the data sources at step in order to determine if the selected view of the entity has changed e.g. new or different member records data within the member records has changed etc. . If the selected view has changed as determined at step entity event notification module triggers an entity change event at step .

The entity change event invokes services module e.g. persistEntity service to add update or delete the persisted entity or party in accordance with the modification e.g. modification to data or links of member records at step . The business keys of an entity attribute may be utilized to determine the presence of new information for a corresponding attribute of the persisted entity or party or the presence of updated information for the corresponding attribute of the persisted entity or party . The modified view e.g. with the added updated or deleted information is persisted in the physical master data management system at step e.g. as described below for .

Alternatively rules may be applied to conditionally persist certain entities in response to an entity change event and based on a set of criteria e.g. completeness data quality of created entity view entity size e.g. number of members or records in the entity etc. .

A manner of persisting an entity to the physical master data management system e.g. via master data management server system and virtual master data management system modules physical master data management system modules and entity management module is illustrated in . Initially the selected or composite view for the entity is requested from the virtual master data management system at step . The selected view may represent a new entity for persistence or an existing persisted entity with modified data. The virtual master data management system typically generates the selected view for the entity on demand from data within data sources . This ensures the most recent data for persistence. The selected or composite view includes the business keys of the entity attributes and is generated in accordance with the constraints of those business keys e.g. indicating a quantity of unique data instances for an attribute etc. . An internal service is utilized to determine the attributes of the entity in the virtual data model that correspond to business keys in the physical data model.

When no view is returned for the entity e.g. a deleted or obsolete entity has been requested as determined at step the entity is deleted e.g. via services module at step . However when the selected or composite view is returned for the entity the mapping to the physical master data management system for the entity is applied e.g. via entity management module to convert the entity to the corresponding business object or party within the physical data model at step . In addition transcoding functions within the mappings are applied to convert values within the virtual data model to compatible values within the physical data model.

The entity identification and corresponding member record identifiers are added updated and or deleted e.g. registration persistence mode within the physical master data management system e.g. via services module e.g. persistEntity service in accordance with the action performed on the entity e.g. add modify or delete an entity or corresponding attributes at step . The action may be determined based on a comparison of the business keys of attributes for the entity and party within the virtual and physical master data management systems. For example a new business key not within the physical master data management system may indicate addition of an attribute and or entity while an existing business key value may indicate an attribute and or entity update. Removal of the business keys may indicate deletion of the attribute and or entity. The party identification may further be utilized to distinguish between actions for attributes and entities as a whole. The information for the entity within the virtual data model is updated within the converted business object or party and corresponding party records of the database tables of the physical data model indicated by the mappings.

When the entity is being fully persisted the corresponding data of the entity is added updated or deleted in the repository of the physical master data management system in accordance with the action performed on the entity e.g. via services module e.g. persistEntity service at step . The action may be determined based on a comparison of the business keys of attributes for the entity and party within the virtual and physical master data management systems as described above. The information for the entity in the virtual data model is updated within the corresponding converted business object or party and party records of the database tables of the physical data model indicated by the mappings.

A manner of processing queries for entities within the plural architecture master data management system e.g. via master data management server system and virtual master data management system modules physical master data management system modules request processing framework and entity management module is illustrated in . Initially a query for an entity is received by request processing framework at step . The query is passed to services of services module e.g. getParty getPerson getOrganization getPartyByAdminSysKey getPartyByEntityId etc. to process the query. These services retrieve entities e.g. person organization etc. and or parties within the virtual and or physical master data management systems based on various criteria e.g. entity or party identification system keys etc. . The entity is initially retrieved from the repository within the physical master data management system and the status indicator is examined to determine the type of persistence. If the entity is fully persisted as determined at step the entity data is retrieved from the repository of the physical master data management system at step and the results are returned at step .

When the entity is persisted in the registration mode e.g. the entity identification and member record identifiers are persisted as determined at step the entity data is retrieved from the virtual master data management system at step and the results are returned at step . In this case the virtual master data management system utilizes the entity identification and member record identifiers to generate the selected entity view from data retrieved from data sources .

When the entity is registered and not persisted in the physical master data management system as determined at step the entity data is retrieved from the virtual master data management system at step and the results are returned at step . In this case the virtual master data management system utilizes the mapping between the virtual and physical master data management systems e.g. mapping of entity and party identifications to identify the corresponding entity within the virtual master data management system and generate the entity view from data retrieved from data sources .
