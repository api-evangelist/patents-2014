title: Interactive content in a messaging platform
abstract: A messaging platform forms an interactive message with one or more components and broadcasts the interactive message to client devices associated with accounts. The interactive message has a plurality of states that update based on event data received from a content source. While the event is in progress, the messaging platform receives event data relating to the event and transitions to an updated state based on the received event data. When the interactive message transitions to the updated state, the messaging platform updates the interactive message broadcast to the client devices. The interactive message may include interactive components that accounts may use to perform various interactions with the event, the content source, or each other.

Online messaging platforms provide an environment for sharing and discussing content. Accounts may discuss content posted by other accounts through social media content items SMCIs . The content in a SMCI is static in that it does not change after the SMCI is authored. Although this property is suitable for many applications static content may not accurately describe live events that are unfolding in real time. Static content in a SMCI may reflect out of date information so the relevance of a SMCI diminishes over time. Additionally SMCIs as a whole present a scattered picture of an event. A social media user seeking a wider perspective on an event can search for SMCIs about an event but a search typically returns only a portion of SMCIs referring to an event.

Reference will now be made in detail to several embodiments examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying figures. It is noted that wherever practicable similar or like reference numbers may be used in the figures and may indicate similar or like functionality. The figures depict embodiments of the disclosed system or method for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following description that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles described herein.

In one example embodiment a messaging platform creates and updates an interactive message having a plurality of states. The messaging platform receives a request from an account of an event moderator to initiate an interactive message. The request specifies a message type and a content source. The messaging platform forms the interactive message including a plurality of states associated with an event. The interactive message is structured according to a template retrieved based on the message type. The template has one or more components structured to present content relevant to the event. The messaging platform broadcasts the interactive message for presentation to users of receiving accounts by client devices.

While the event is in progress the messaging platform receives event data relating to the event. The received event data are received from the content source. Based on the event data the messaging platform transitions the interactive message to an updated state from the plurality of states. In response to transitioning to the updated state the messaging platform updates the interactive message broadcast to the accounts. Updating the interactive message may include presenting the updates to users of accounts that have received the interactive message by updating a representation of the interactive message presented by a client device. It is noted that the disclosed embodiments include without limitation methods systems and computer readable media for creating and updating the interactive message.

Referring now to illustrated are connections among agents interacting in a messaging environment according to one example embodiment. The agents include a content source a messaging platform an event moderator a client device and a network . It is noted that multiple instances of the disclosed agents may be present in various embodiments and that references herein to an agent e.g. a content source an event moderator a client device et cetera generally refer to one or more of the agents. In an alternative embodiment the functionalities of multiple agents may be merged modified or split into a functionally equivalent set of agents.

To form an interactive message the messaging platform uses event data which describe facets of an event e.g. a sporting event a race an awards show a political event a news event a musical concert a fashion show a contest a live chat with a celebrity over the Internet . Event data may include any data gathered from an event including images text numerical data and time based media TBM content. Example text includes closed captions transcriptions of broadcast audio and descriptions of the event. Numerical data can include manually input data and data from devices and sensors that transmit data. For example event data from a sporting event include statistics from a scorekeeper recording the results of plays and data from sensors that monitor game participants and objects e.g. radar that records a ball s position or speed a Global Positioning System GPS sensor that tracks the position of a motor sports event participant a physiological sensor on an event participant . TBM content has a time component and includes broadcast television radio videos animations audio files and interactive media e.g. a game virtual reality an interactive advertisement . Event data may be obtained from a variety of sources such as local or network stores as well as directly from sensors or capture devices such as cameras video recorders microphones and live broadcasts. It is anticipated that other types of event data within the scope of the disclosed embodiments will be developed in the future e.g. three dimensional media .

A content source disseminates event data from an event in progress over the network . The content source may be an entity that organizes an event e.g. a sports league an industry association organizing an awards show or an entity that distributes event data e.g. a television network a radio station a news service a website . The content source captures event data and provides the event data in a suitable form to the agents e.g. the messaging platform the event moderator et cetera . For example the content source streams video footage of a baseball game and uploads game statistics and photographs of players to a web server accessible by the agents substantially in real time. Real time communication can include for example receiving event data while the event is in progress and or during concurrent sessions established with the messaging platform e.g. a first session with a content source and a second session with a client device . The content source may implement access restrictions such as granting certain agents access to certain event data. Multiple content sources may disseminate event data about the same event. For example a television network disseminates TBM content about a presidential debate and the debate organizer disseminates event data indicating the current question or issue under discussion as well as remaining time allotments for speaking. The content source may receive interaction aggregations from the messaging platform which may be incorporated in event data. For example a broadcast of a presidential debate incorporates an interaction aggregation summarizing sentiment towards the presidential candidates based on interactions with a corresponding interactive message.

The messaging platform creates and distributes interactive messages based in part on event data received from one or more content sources . The messaging platform may include components of a social networking service SNS such as a social network forum or user group. The messaging platform enables accounts also referred to as authors to communicate and interact with other accounts through the messaging platform . An account may author or redistribute social media content items SMCIs such as interactive messages posts videos photos links status updates blog entries profiles and the like. An interactive message presents event data from an event and may also include author created content. For example an account redistributes an interactive message and includes an author reaction. An interactive message is associated with a plurality of states. Based on a present state the interactive message may present different event data or other content.

The event moderator initiates the interactive message. In one embodiment the event moderator selects a message type and an event to create an interactive message. The event moderator configures the interactive message to present event data and to update in response to event data. Updating an interactive message includes transitioning between states of the interactive message and or presenting different or more current event data. The event moderator may manually update the interactive message as an alternative or supplement to automatic updates based on event data. The event moderator may additionally add moderator content such as text an image or TBM content to an interactive message. For example the event moderator initiates an interactive message about a baseball game. The interactive message presents pitch selection and velocity event data and textual commentary submitted by the event moderator moderator content . The event moderator may be an account of the messaging platform or may be associated with a content source . For example a television broadcaster initiates and maintains an interactive message in addition to broadcasting video footage of an event.

The client device presents the interactive message to a user of a receiving account for subsequent interaction. Client devices include mobile devices e.g. smart phones tablets personal digital assistants smart watches and computers e.g. desktops laptops . Computers and mobile devices are described further with respect to . A client device may be associated with one or more accounts of the messaging platform . As used herein a client device refers to the physical client device as well as any associated accounts human users and or simulated human users of the client device .

The network comprises components for transmitting information between agents using wireless and or wired media. For example a network includes wide area and local area networks such as electromagnetic broadcasting systems satellite networks cellular networks fiber optic networks cable networks or the Internet. The network may include multiple networks transmitting information with analog signals digital signals or a combination thereof. The network may include a content delivery network that distributes content using servers distributed across multiple data centers located in different geographical locations.

The account data store stores information regarding accounts of the messaging platform . Examples of stored data include identifying information such as a user name an account identifier a password one or more profile images one or more user locations an associated website a biography an email address a phone number content preferences privacy settings demographic information account associations with other accounts of the message platform and associations with other social networking systems. Content preferences include interests or preferred topics or genres for the account as explicitly provided by the user of an account associated with a client device or as inferred from the account s authored SMCIs. Similarly other information stored in the account data store may be received through a client device and or inferred by the messaging platform . In one embodiment a content source or an event moderator has an account on the messaging platform and thus has a corresponding entry in the account data store .

In one embodiment the account data store contains connection information forming a connection graph. The graph may contain unidirectional and or bidirectional connections. For example an account may follow a source account and is therefore subscribed to receive messages from the source account. In this example graph data associated with the account indicates a unidirectional connection to the source account. As a second example two accounts may connect with each other forming a bidirectional connection. In this second example each of the two accounts receives messages published by the other account.

The account data store logs account actions on the messaging platform including adding an association with another account authoring a SMCI sending a SMCI to another account and reading a SMCI from another account. The account data store logs a date and time corresponding to a logged action. Logged actions include interactions with interactive messages. The logged account actions may be used to determine relevance of an interactive message to an account. For example an account authors a SMCI that includes content related to an event. The action is logged and the message routing module infers that the event is relevant to the account. The message routing module may identify the account to receive an interactive message related to the inferred event.

The event data store contains event data that have been retrieved from or received from the content source . The event data store contains event data and or references to event data stored elsewhere e.g. a content delivery network the content source a third party server . The stored event data may include metadata about the event data. For example metadata about TBM content may include a title a description the content source and the associated event. Metadata about a sensor device may include the content source as well as the sensor device type and location for example.

The template store includes one or more templates structured to visually and or aurally present event data in an interactive message. A template specifies one or more components as well as a visual and or temporal arrangement of the components. A component may present event data associated with the interactive message moderator content or an interaction with the interactive message by an account. A template may be adapted for a particular type of client device or group thereof based on display characteristics e.g. aspect ratio display area size display resolution computing characteristics e.g. operating system type browsing application type processing speed available memory and aural characteristics e.g. presence of audio playback devices volume information . In other words different client devices may present a template differently to adapt to client device capabilities. In one embodiment a template presents a different arrangement of components depending on a current state e.g. most recently updated state of the interactive message. Example components include a title a description a summary a category a byline an image text TBM content and an interactive component. Components that are associated with interactions are referred to herein as interactive components. 

The content retrieval module communicates with the content source to retrieve event data. The event data may be used by the message layout engine and or may be stored in the event data store . In one embodiment the content retrieval module requests updated event data from the content source . Alternatively or additionally the content retrieval module monitors the content source for changes and retrieves updated event data substantially in real time. In one embodiment the content retrieval module receives updates sent by the event source substantially in real time. The content retrieval module updates event data in the event data store which may be retrieved by the layout engine or by a client device .

The message layout engine forms an interactive message using a template retrieved from the template store . The formed interactive message is presented using the account interface . Based on a message type specified by the event moderator the message layout engine selects a template for presenting the interactive message. The message layout engine maps event data interactions interaction aggregations and or moderator content onto components of the selected template. For example an interactive message invites users of receiving accounts to predict the outcome of the next play in a football game. Some of the example components offer options to predict a play outcome and others indicate an account s last play prediction and the actual outcome. As another example an interactive message covering a political speech includes components that present to a user of a receiving account supplementary statistics and evidence from the speaker s political party and or components that present rebuttal arguments and statistics from a political party that opposes the speaker.

In one embodiment the message layout engine personalizes a layout for an account based on associations with other accounts retrieved from the account data store . For example a template includes a social interaction component that presents interactions with the interactive message by other accounts associated with an account. In one embodiment the message layout engine associates a component with a reference to event data or moderator content and a client device retrieves the event data or moderator content for the component e.g. from the event data store from the content source from an external server .

The message routing module determines accounts to receive a broadcast interactive message based in part on information from the account data store . In one embodiment the event moderator specifies one or more accounts to receive an interactive message. Alternatively or additionally the message routing module retrieves accounts associated with an account of the event moderator from the account data store . These associated accounts are selected to receive the interactive message. The message routing module may select an account to receive the interactive message based on a stated or inferred preference of that account. For example an account with a stated preference to receive SMCIs about movies is selected to receive an interactive message about an ongoing movie awards show. As another example an account authors multiple SMCIs about a local baseball team. Based on the SMCIs a preference for baseball is inferred so the message routing module selects the account to receive an interactive message associated with a game that the local baseball team is playing. In one embodiment an account that receives a broadcast interactive message can direct the message routing module to broadcast the interactive message to accounts associated with the receiving account or one or more accounts specified by the receiving account.

More broadly the message routing module determines accounts to receive messages broadcast or multicast through the messaging platform . In one embodiment the account data store contains connection information stored as graph data. When a sending account broadcasts a message through the messaging platform the message routing module identifies one or more recipient accounts based on the predefined graph relationships in the account data store. For example a user of a sending account participates in an interactive message and opts to share the interactive message with followers of the sending account. In this example the routing module identifies recipient accounts to receive the interactive message. Hence accounts besides the event moderator can broadcast an interactive message in one embodiment.

The interaction module handles interactions between a user of a receiving account and an interactive message. In one example embodiment an interactive message contains one or more interactive components that a user of a receiving account may activate to interact with an interactive message. Interactions include an answer to an objective question about an ongoing past or future event an answer to a subjective question about an ongoing past or future event a reaction to another account s interaction a transaction an identification of event data in a component of the template a reaction or a command. Example objective questions include predicting an award winner at an awards show a play s outcome in a sporting event a winning team in a game a winning participant in a race or weather on a particular day e.g. a measure of precipitation a temperature . At some point during an event the state trigger module transitions to an updated state and the interaction module determines whether answers from various accounts to the objective question are correct or incorrect based on the updated state. The account interface may update the interactive message presented by the client device to indicate whether the user of the receiving account has answered the objective question correctly or incorrectly e.g. a component of the interactive message indicates whether a user of a receiving account s prediction was vindicated . Example subjective questions include an expression of opinion a rating of a media event a selection of a favorite play at a sporting event or a positive or negative reaction to a political candidate s speech.

In one embodiment the interaction module receives through a client device an identification of event data from a user of a receiving account. Using a client device the user of the receiving account identifies event data in an interactive component by identifying event data e.g. an object a person a segment of TBM content incorporated in another segment of TBM content extracting a feature from event data or associating supplemental information with event data. For example a client device of a receiving account presents an image of an athlete the client device then receives a selection indicating the portion of the image representing the athlete s face and an input identifying the athlete s name. As another example a client device presents a video of a race to a user of a receiving account the client device receives a selection of the portions of the video containing the race car as well as a textual input identifying the driver of the racecar or the racecar s team name. Similarly a client device may receive a location associated with an image or a video component from a user of a receiving account. Client devices may receive inputs from users of receiving accounts to extract features such as the winning sail boat in a race or the official scoring of a baseball play. In one embodiment a client device presents an image or TBM media showing an object in a component and the client device receives supplemental information about the person or object. For example a user of a receiving account provides through a client device supplemental information about an actress s birthday or a reference to a documentary about an actor s difficulties with hotel housekeeping staff. The interaction module records event data received through interactions. Through interactive components that identify event data a user of a receiving account may contribute event data in a similar manner to an event moderator .

In one embodiment the interaction module handles reactions to interactions. An example template presents a social interaction component next to a reaction component. Using a reaction component a user of a receiving account can react to an interaction by another account through a client device . Example reactions include a unary reaction e.g. a like a favorite a binary reaction e.g. up vote or down vote like or dislike a multiple choice reaction e.g. emoticons adjectives or a custom reaction e.g. a text box a user submitted image user submitted TBM . For example a client device receives an emoticon input selected by a user of an account to taunt the user of another account about an incorrect prediction or to express shock at another account user s opinion of an actress s dress. The interaction module records interactions and notifies an interacting account when another account reacts to the interacting account s interaction.

The interaction module handles transactions such as a donation sale purchase or wager. For example an interactive message about a charity benefit concert invites a user of a receiving account to donate to the charity or buy memorabilia or an interactive message about a horse race includes a component that sells a wager on the horse race to an account. Through a social interaction component client devices present an account s transaction interaction to users of other receiving accounts. The interaction module includes handling of interactive message commands such as a start pause stop rewind or fast forward command to control playback of TBM content e.g. using a video or audio player associated with a component . Other example commands share an interactive message with one or more accounts associated with a client device s account e.g. based on graph data or connection data from the account data store or share an account s interaction with another account.

The interaction module records interactions for use by the interaction analysis module . In one embodiment the interaction module collects interactions by various accounts and presents them in a social interaction component of a template presented by a client device . The interaction module may select interactions to present to a user of a receiving account via a client device according to accounts connected to the receiving account. Alternatively or additionally the interaction module selects interactions to present to a user of a receiving account via a client device based on other data retrieved from the account data store such as geographic proximity or demographics or based on information about the received interactions e.g. time priority response diversity .

The state trigger module uses triggers such as event data a SMCI an interaction and or manual commands from an event moderator to update a state associated with an interactive event. An interactive message has a plurality of states which are predefined. The interactive message transitions from a current event state to an updated event state according to triggers associated with the current state e.g. most recently updated state . The interactive message template updates in response to a state transition. For example the components of the template presented to a user of a receiving account change or the event data or content presented in a component changes. For example an interactive message about a baseball game has an at bat and a big play state. In the at bat state the template presents event data from pitch sensors and includes interaction components prompting users of receiving accounts to predict the next pitch type and to transmit their selection to the messaging platform through their client devices . When the content retrieval module receives event data indicating that a batter has reached a base or scored the state trigger module transitions to the big play state which includes a video player component that shows a replay of the base hit or score.

In one embodiment the state trigger module analyzes event data to extract features from images or TBM content. Generally feature extraction recognizes a coherent portion spatial or temporal of an image or TBM content and or links a recognized portion to a linguistic description. Feature extraction includes recognizing faces or objects associating audio with an object in a video speech to text processing recognizing meaningful breakpoints in TBM content simplifying a video sequence to a textual description of events or inferring numerical data about an object from a video. For example feature extraction identifies when a football play begins and ends the position of the ball to start the next play the team with possession to start the next play or whether any points were scored. Based on recognizing that a play has occurred the state trigger module transitions between states in a related interactive message. As another example the state transition module recognizes from a video feed of a concurrent broadcast an actor or actress arriving at a movie awards show and transitions to a state specific to the recognized actor or actress.

In one embodiment the state trigger module analyzes SMCIs received by the message platform to trigger a state transition. The state trigger module infers event data from received SMCIs based on textual linguistic analysis and or feature extraction of images or TBM content in a SMCI. Inferring event data may rely on statistical methods that account for the number of accounts mentioning similar combinations of words and or trustworthiness of accounts e.g. based on an institutional affiliation . Inferring event data may include analysis of data from the account data store and or correlation with event data. For example the state trigger module infers that a musician has won an award at an awards show based on SMCIs received substantially in real time about the award and the musician. The state trigger module weights a SMCI associated with the musician s record label or the award granting institution higher than it weights a SMCI from a typical account. As another example the state trigger module recognizes a score in a game e.g. a goal in a soccer game based on category tags in SMCIs. In this example the recognized goal triggers a state change in an interactive message about the soccer game.

In one embodiment the state rigger module receives event data from the event moderator that indicate the updated state for the next transition. In other words the event moderator manually instructs the state trigger module to transition the interactive message to a specified updated state. In one embodiment the state trigger module uses event data gathered from interactions with an interactive message. Based on an analysis of an interactive message component that prompt users of receiving accounts to identify event data in a component the state trigger module identifies a trigger to transition between states. The techniques used may be similar to those used to infer event data from SMCIs.

The interaction analysis module creates interaction aggregations from received interactions. An interaction aggregation is a textual graphical e.g. a bar graph a pie chart numerical and or TBM content summary of interactions. For example the interaction analysis module computes percentage responses of accounts that like and dislike a decision to award a painter in a concurrently broadcast art awards ceremony. Interactions may be aggregated according to demographic geographic or other information from the account data store . For example an interactive message that asks users of receiving accounts to predict the outcome of a game between two sports teams. The interaction analysis module may create a graphical representation of responses overlaid on a map. For example an image demonstrates interactive responses over time or an animation presents interactive response over time.

In one embodiment a component of an interactive message template may present the interaction aggregation. An interaction aggregation may include data from a subset of accounts on the messaging platform such as other accounts associated with an account or accounts that share a characteristic with an account e.g. geographic demographic other information from the account data store . For example a template presents an aggregation interaction based on accounts that went to the same undergraduate institution as the account associated with a viewing client device .

The account interface is structured to present the components of a template as well as event data moderator content interactions or interaction aggregations mapped to the components by the message layout engine . One embodiment of the account interface is described with respect to .

In one embodiment the account interface presents interactions recorded by the interaction module to users of receiving accounts as part of an interactive message. The message routing module may identify one or more accounts of interest to a receiving account based on graph data and connections. For example an interface component presents to the user of a receiving account interactions of accounts that the receiving account is subscribed to. As a more specific example the account interface presents donations made by accounts a receiving account is subscribed to. The message routing module may identify accounts to present based on an analysis of graph data e.g. common subscriptions and common subscribers between the presented account and the receiving account or an analysis of logged account actions e.g. number and type of actions with the presented account . In one embodiment the message routing module may filter accounts that a receiving account is subscribed to for accounts that have interacted with the interactive message. The remaining accounts are scored based on the receiving account and ranked top ranking accounts are selected for presentation in an interactive message component to the user of the receiving account.

The event moderator interface is structured to present an interface for an event moderator to initiate an interactive message. In one embodiment the event moderator interface includes a plurality of prebuilt templates structured for a class of events. Alternatively or additionally an event moderator may select and or arrange components to create or edit a template. The event moderator may select event data from a content source to associate with components of a template. For example an event moderator selects event data such as an image that a first component presents regardless of the state and the event moderator selects event data e.g. statistics that a second component presents depending on the most recently updated state of the interactive message.

The web server links the messaging platform to the network and other agents coupled thereto and is one means for doing so. The web server may include messaging functionality for receiving and routing data between the agents. The web server serves web pages as well as other web related content such as Java Flash and so forth. Example web pages are represented using HyperText Markup Language HTML Extensible Markup Language XML JavaScript Object Notation JSON and or PHP Hypertext Preprocessor PHP .

The API in conjunction with web server allows one or more external entities to access information from the messaging platform . The web server may also allow external entities to send information to and or receive information from the messaging platform through the API . For example an external entity sends an API request to the messaging platform via the network and the web server receives the API request. The web server processes the request by calling an API associated with the API request to generate an appropriate response which the web server communicates to the external entity e.g. an application on the client device via the network .

The message routing module selects one or more accounts to receive a broadcasted interactive message. The messaging platform broadcasts the interactive message for presentation to users of the selected accounts using client devices . In one embodiment broadcasting an interactive message includes making the interactive message available on the web server or through the API to accounts on the messaging platform including accounts not selected by the message routing module to receive the interactive message. For example the interactive message appears in related search results and or is accessible through a webpage. As another example an application on a client device accesses the interactive message through the API . A broadcast SMCI may be received or accessed by all accounts a subset of accounts chosen by the event moderator and or a subset of accounts selected by the message routing module .

While the event is in progress the content retrieval module receives one or more instances of event data relating to the event. In one embodiment the one or more instances of event data are received substantially in real time from the content source . The state trigger module determines if the received one or more instances of event data trigger a state transition. If the one or more instances of event data trigger a state transition the state trigger module also determines an updated state and transitions the interactive message to that updated state . If the received one or more instances of event data do not trigger a state transition the messaging platform waits to receive and evaluate additional event data. In response to transitioning to the updated state the content retrieval module updates the interactive message broadcast to the plurality of accounts. For example the content retrieval module pushes event data related to updated event components of an interactive event template presented by the client devices .

In one embodiment the state trigger module uses the messaging platform as a content source . To transition the state the content retrieval module obtains a plurality of SMCIs that include content such as text an image TBM content and or a tag. The state trigger module determines the updated state based at least in part on an analysis of the content of the plurality of SMCIs. Alternatively or additionally the interactive message s event is associated with concurrently broadcast content and the content retrieval module receives event data comprising the concurrently broadcast content. The state transition module determines the updated state based on at least in part features extracted from the concurrently broadcast content. In one embodiment the content retrieval module receives an instance of event data from the event moderator . The received instance of event data directly indicates the updated state for a next transition.

The messaging platform repeatedly receives event data determines if the event data trigger a state transition transitions to the updated state and updates the interactive message while the event is in progress. An event is in progress while the corresponding one or more content sources produce or transmit updated event data. For example a content source about a football game transmits updates before the game e.g. injury reports pregame interviews during the game e.g. broadcast footage play results player statistics and after the game e.g. fan reactions player interviews so the event is in progress during all of these time periods. If no further event data are received then the process ends after updating the interactive message.

As illustrated client device B receives the broadcast interaction and presents the interacting user s interaction to a user of a reacting account. The interaction is presented through a social interaction component along with interactions from other accounts that may have been received. In one embodiment the interactive message includes interaction components that support reactions. The user of the reacting account reacts using client device B to an interaction from the interacting user of client device A and reports the reaction to the messaging platform similar to reporting for other interactions. The interaction module records the reacting account s reaction to the interaction from the interacting account. The message layout engine updates the social interaction component of the interactive message to present the reaction to the user of the interacting account. The messaging platform broadcasts the update to client devices including the client device A of the interactive account. The message platform may receive a plurality of reactions from a plurality of client devices to one or more interactions presented in a social interaction component. The client device A presents the reaction from the reacting account to the user of the interacting account in the updated social interaction component.

In one embodiment the message routing module broadcasts the interaction aggregation to a content source which presents the interaction aggregation through broadcast or multicast media. The content source may be a provider of concurrently broadcast content that incorporates the broadcast interaction aggregation from the messaging platform into a televised broadcast. For example an interactive message includes an objective question about which team will win a football game. In this example a determined interaction aggregation indicates percentages of accounts that have picked each team. These percentages are incorporated into a broadcast telecast of the game in the form of a graph indicating predictions by the users of the receiving accounts about the game winner over the course of the football game.

Alternatively or additionally the message layout engine updates the interactive message with the interaction aggregation. For example a component structured to present the interaction aggregation to a user of a receiving account is updated. The message routing module broadcasts the interaction aggregation to one or more of the plurality of client devices which present the interaction aggregation to a plurality of users of receiving accounts. For example a client device indicates aggregate predictions from accounts associated with the receiving account of the user of the client device .

To view the interactive message in one embodiment a user of the receiving account selects the view button which presents the expanded form of the interactive message. The reduced form of the interactive message may include standard functionality associated with a SMCI. For example a user of a receiving account may use the reply button to broadcast an SMCI to the event moderator or use the share button to broadcast the SMCI to other accounts associated with the receiving account using the message routing module . The user of the receiving account may mark the SMCI as a favorite to add the SMCI to a collection of favorite SMCIs and or to provide feedback to the event moderator .

Turning to illustrated is the SMCI of in an expanded form to present the contained interactive message. In the expanded form the SMCI includes additional components such as a prompt interactive component response interactive components A and moderator content . The response interaction components generally may be divided into two or more selectable regions within the user interface. Each region may correspond with a pre specified response that is recorded if selected. The prompt interactive component presents an objective question to the user of a receiving account who may make a prediction about which football team is going to win the game using the response interactive components A e.g. select one side or the other of the response interactive component A . The interaction module records interactions between the user of the receiving account and the response interactive components A. Moderator content may indicate an event moderator s commentary on the event or instructions for interacting with the interactive message.

Based on event data from a content source the state trigger module triggers the interactive message to transition to an updated state. A user interface corresponding to the updated state is illustrated in . In the updated state the interactive message presents an arrangement of components including the profile image the user name the account identifier the SMCI content a result indicator an interaction aggregation a social interaction component account identifiers a prediction and reactions . The arrangement of components corresponds to an example post kickoff state that indicates the result of the kickoff and other accounts predictions for the result of the kickoff. The result indicator indicates the result of the previous play based on event data from the content retrieval module . The interaction aggregation indicates a percentage of accounts that predicted a given outcome as determined by the interaction analysis module .

The social interaction component is structured to present to a user of a receiving account an interaction that the interaction module received from another interacting account. In one embodiment the accounts presented in a social interaction component are based at least in part on directional connections between the receiving account and other accounts. For example the user of the receiving account subscribes to the displayed accounts in the social interaction components . The interaction identifiers include the profile image user name and account identifier of the interacting account. The prediction indicates that interacting account s answer to the objective question. The user of the receiving account may select one or more reactions to cheer with commiserate with or taunt the interacting account.

Referring now to illustrated is a block diagram illustrating components of an example machine able to read instructions from a machine readable medium and execute them in a processor or controller . Specifically shows a diagrammatic representation of a machine in the example form of a computer system within which instructions e.g. software or a computer program product for causing the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein may be executed. The instructions correspond to processes or functionality as described in . In alternative embodiments the machine operates as a standalone device or may be connected e.g. networked to other machines. In a networked deployment the machine may operate in the capacity of a server machine or a client machine in a server client network environment or as a peer machine in a peer to peer or distributed network environment.

The machine may be a server computer a client computer a personal computer PC a tablet PC a set top box STB a personal digital assistant PDA a cellular telephone a smart phone a web appliance a network router switch or bridge or any machine capable of executing instructions sequential or otherwise that specify actions to be taken by that machine. Further while only a single machine is illustrated the term machine shall also be taken to include any collection of machines that individually or jointly execute instructions to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein.

The example computer system includes one or more processors generally a processor such as a central processing unit CPU a graphics processing unit GPU a digital signal processor DSP one or more application specific integrated circuits ASICs one or more radio frequency integrated circuits RFICs or any combination of these a main memory and a static memory which are configured to communicate with each other via a bus . The computer system may further include graphics display unit e.g. a plasma display panel PDP a liquid crystal display LCD a projector or a cathode ray tube CRT . The computer system may also include alphanumeric input device e.g. a keyboard a cursor control device e.g. a mouse a trackball a joystick a motion sensor or other pointing instrument a storage unit a signal generation device e.g. a speaker and a network interface device which also are configured to communicate via the bus . The display unit may be integrated with the alphanumeric input device and or cursor control device e.g. a touch screen display .

The storage unit includes a machine readable medium on which is stored instructions e.g. software embodying any one or more of the methodologies or functions described herein. The instructions e.g. software may also reside completely or at least partially within the main memory or within the processor e.g. within a processor s cache memory during execution thereof by the computer system the main memory and the processor also constituting machine readable media. The instructions e.g. software may be transmitted or received over a network via the network interface device .

While machine readable medium is shown in an example embodiment to be a single medium the term machine readable medium should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media e.g. a centralized or distributed database or associated caches and servers able to store instructions e.g. instructions . The term machine readable medium shall also be taken to include any medium that is capable of storing instructions e.g. instructions for execution by the machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies disclosed herein. The term machine readable medium includes but not be limited to data repositories in the form of solid state memories optical media and magnetic media.

The example computer system may be used to implement the client device and the event moderator may use an example computer system to interface with the messaging platform . In one embodiment the messaging platform and the content source are implemented on servers that include many of the components of the example computer system but may omit components including the display unit the alphanumeric input device and or the cursor control device .

The disclosed embodiments beneficially allow for creation of a SMCI about an event that remains relevant as the event progresses. By receiving event data substantially in real time and by associating the received event data with a component of an interactive message s template the interactive message presents content that updates substantially in real time with the event. The plurality of states in an interactive message provide for presentation of components that are relevant for the interactive message s focus given the development of the event. Interactive components provide a platform for a centralized community of accounts to interact and experience an event together. Interaction aggregations summarize interactions with the interactive message and can even provide a content source with interaction data from a messaging environment e.g. a social network environment a publish subscribe messaging environment . Interactive components that identify event data may be used to crowd source feature extraction from an event. The content source receives feedback substantially in real time based on interaction aggregations and event data.

Throughout this specification plural instances may implement components operations or structures described as a single instance. Although individual operations of one or more methods are illustrated and described as separate operations one or more of the individual operations may be performed concurrently and nothing requires that the operations be performed in the order illustrated. Structures and functionality presented as separate components in example configurations may be implemented as a combined structure or component. Similarly structures and functionality presented as a single component may be implemented as separate components. These and other variations modifications additions and improvements fall within the scope of the subject matter herein.

Certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of components modules or mechanisms for example as illustrated in . Modules may constitute either software modules e.g. code embodied on a machine readable medium or in a transmission signal or hardware modules. A hardware module is tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments one or more computer systems e.g. a standalone client or server computer system or one or more hardware modules of a computer system e.g. a processor or a group of processors may be configured by software e.g. an application or application portion as a hardware module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.

In various embodiments a hardware module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example a hardware module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured e.g. as a special purpose processor such as a field programmable gate array FPGA or an application specific integrated circuit ASIC to perform certain operations. A hardware module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry e.g. as encompassed within a general purpose processor or other programmable processor that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry or in temporarily configured circuitry e.g. configured by software may be driven by cost and time considerations.

The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed at least partially by one or more processors e.g. processor that are temporarily configured e.g. by software or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured such processors may constitute processor implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may in some example embodiments comprise processor implemented modules.

The one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a cloud computing environment or as a software as a service SaaS . For example at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers as examples of machines including processors these operations being accessible via a network e.g. the Internet and via one or more appropriate interfaces e.g. application program interfaces APIs .

The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors not only residing within a single machine but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments the one or more processors or processor implemented modules may be located in a single geographic location e.g. within a home environment an office environment or a server farm . In other example embodiments the one or more processors or processor implemented modules may be distributed across a number of geographic locations.

Some portions of this specification are presented in terms of algorithms or symbolic representations of operations on data stored as bits or binary digital signals within a machine memory e.g. a computer memory . These algorithms or symbolic representations are examples of techniques used by those of ordinary skill in the data processing arts to convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. As used herein an algorithm is a self consistent sequence of operations or similar processing leading to a desired result. In this context algorithms and operations involve physical manipulation of physical quantities. Typically but not necessarily such quantities may take the form of electrical magnetic or optical signals capable of being stored accessed transferred combined compared or otherwise manipulated by a machine. It is convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to such signals using words such as data content bits values elements symbols characters terms numbers numerals or the like. These words however are merely convenient labels and are to be associated with appropriate physical quantities.

Unless specifically stated otherwise discussions herein using words such as processing computing calculating determining presenting displaying or the like may refer to actions or processes of a machine e.g. a computer that manipulates or transforms data represented as physical e.g. electronic magnetic or optical quantities within one or more memories e.g. volatile memory non volatile memory or a combination thereof registers or other machine components that receive store transmit or display information.

Some embodiments may be described using the expression coupled and connected along with their derivatives. For example some embodiments may be described using the term coupled to indicate that two or more elements are in direct physical or electrical contact. The term coupled however may also mean that two or more elements are not in direct contact with each other but yet still co operate or interact with each other. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

As used herein the terms comprises comprising includes including has having or any other variation thereof are intended to cover a non exclusive inclusion. For example a process method article or apparatus that comprises a list of elements is not necessarily limited to only those elements but may include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to such process method article or apparatus. Further unless expressly stated to the contrary or refers to an inclusive or and not to an exclusive or. For example a condition A or B is satisfied by any one of the following A is true or present and B is false or not present A is false or not present and B is true or present and both A and B are true or present .

In addition use of the a or an are employed to describe elements and components of the embodiments herein. This is done merely for convenience and to give a general sense of the invention. This description should be read to include one or at least one and the singular also includes the plural unless it is obvious that it is meant otherwise.
