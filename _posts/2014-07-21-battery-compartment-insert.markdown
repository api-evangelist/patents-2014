title: Battery compartment insert
abstract: A battery compartment insert for use with a battery holder that utilizes an assembly of two cells sealed in shrink wrap, thus replacing the need for use of the battery assembly. The insert includes a battery compartment lid for holding two separate lithium bromide battery cells and four electrical contacts. There are two electrical contacts corresponding to each battery cell. The battery compartment lid includes two diodes each corresponding to one of the battery cells and guide posts such that each individual battery cell can be taken out and replaced. The battery compartment lid corresponds to the battery holder such that two electrical contacts are each able to electrically communicate with a corresponding battery cell such that a device may be powered by the battery cells.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

Common digital transponders CXP for IFF Identification friend or foe an electronic radio based identification system systems utilize a non rechargeable battery pack. This is particularly true for navy aircraft ships and vehicles. Replacement of this battery pack is cumbersome requires training and causes unnecessary battery related tampers. This in turn often interferes with mission capability and is expensive. Currently the cost of one non rechargeable battery part is over 125.

Currently the Navy utilizes the RT 1912C APX transponder which utilizes a battery pack that is an assembly of two lithium bromide AA cells that are sealed in shrink wrap. A pair of wires emanate from the pack. The wires form a harness that terminates at a miniature 2 pin connection. To replace the battery pack a user must loosen several screws lift the battery cover disconnect the battery pack from the internal cable harness then connect the new battery pack to the internal cable harness via the 2 pin connection. During this procedure there is a risk of improper connection and or damaging the pair of wires. Also during the course of changing the battery pack there is significant battery related loss of Quadrant Key Encryption QKEK .

A battery compartment insert is needed to eliminate the need to use expensive battery packs allowing use of easy to insert individual batteries and allow quick replacement of the batteries.

The present invention is directed to a battery compartment insert with the needs enumerated above and below.

The present invention is directed to a battery compartment insert for use with a battery holder that can hold an assembly of two cells. The battery compartment insert includes a battery compartment lid for holding two separate lithium bromide battery cells and two electrical contacts. The battery compartment lid includes two diodes each corresponding to one of the battery cells and guide posts such that each individual battery cell can be taken out and replaced. The battery compartment lid corresponds to the battery holder such that the two electrical contacts are each able to electrically communicate with a corresponding battery cell such that a device may be powered by the battery cells.

It is a feature of the present invention to provide a battery compartment insert that eliminates the need for a non rechargeable battery pack.

It is a feature of the present invention to provide a battery compartment insert that allows use of standard sized batteries particularly AA non rechargeable lithium bromide in equipment that currently utilizes battery packs.

The preferred embodiments of the present invention are illustrated by way of example below and in . As shown in the battery compartment insert is for use with a battery holder that utilizes an assembly of two cells sealed in shrink wrap thus replacing the need for use of the battery assembly. The insert includes a battery compartment lid for holding two separate lithium bromide battery cells thereby eliminating the need for a battery assembly and four electrical contacts . As shown in there are two electrical contacts corresponding to each battery cell . The battery compartment lid includes two diodes each corresponding to one of the battery cells and guide posts such that each individual battery cell can be taken out and replaced. The battery compartment lid corresponds to the battery holder such that two electrical contacts are each able to electrically communicate with a corresponding battery cell such that a device may be powered by the battery cells .

In the description of the present invention the invention will be discussed in an aircraft and ship environment however this invention can be utilized for any type of application that requires use of a battery.

In one of the embodiments of the invention the battery compartment insert may also include battery clips for holding the individual battery cells in place such that electrical communication is maintained. Each battery clip may be positioned and correspond to a battery clip cutout . As shown in each battery clip is disposed on the battery compartment lid within a corresponding battery clip cutout . The battery clips may be fastened to the battery compartment via battery clip screws or any type of fastener practicable.

The battery compartment insert may be fastened to the mechanism being powered or any other item via holder lid rivets used in conjunction with a washer . However any type of alternative type of fastener may be utilized. As shown in the battery holder may have a rectangular shape with the fasteners disposed near the corners of the battery holder .

When introducing elements of the present invention or the preferred embodiment s thereof the articles a an the and said are intended to mean there are one or more of the elements. The terms comprising including and having are intended to be inclusive and mean that there may be additional elements other than the listed elements.

Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail with reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof other embodiments are possible. Therefore the spirit and scope of the appended claims should not be limited to the description of the preferred embodiment s contained herein.
