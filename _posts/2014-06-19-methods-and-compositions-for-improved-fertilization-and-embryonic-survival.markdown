This is a divisional application of U.S. application Ser. No. 13 563 750 filed on Aug. 1 2012 claiming priority to U.S. Patent Application No. 61 514 030 filed on Aug. 2 2011 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

This invention was made with government support under 09 CRHF 0 6055 awarded by the USDA NIFA. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to a method of genetic testing for improved fertilization rate and embryonic survival rate in animals especially dairy cattle based on single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in genes encoding the heat shock proteins HSP .

Poor reproductive performance in particular in high producing dairy cows is a major problem on dairy farms throughout the world and has been identified as the single most important problem in dairy herd management in many countries Royal et al. 2000 Dobson et al. 2008 . In addition to direct financial losses infertility can result in increased management complexity for example an inability to achieve a compact calving pattern which is of critical importance in maximizing milk production from grazed grass in seasonal production systems.

This is of particular interest in cattle because of declining fertility over the past few decades Dobson et al. 2007 Leroy et al. 2008 . Furthermore recent studies have shown that low fertilization rates and embryonic loss seem to be the main factors in dairy cattle infertility Santos et al. 2004 Morris and Diskin 2008 .

While reproductive performance is influenced by a large number of factors low fertilization rate and early embryonic loss are the primary factors contributing to poor reproductive performance in dairy cattle Santos et al. 2004 Morris and Diskin 2008 . Enormous efforts such as animal breeding and artificial insemination have been and continue to be invested in ensuring adequate fertility in the cattle herd. Typically artificial insemination in dairy cattle is successful only 30 35 of the time. The reasons for this are not clear. However it is understood that both biological and environmental factors affect fertility rate. Some environmental factors such as high temperature and lack of precipitation can cause stress in cattle and can drop the fertility rate to 10 15 . Commercial artificial insemination operations often shut down in July and August due to the drop in fertility caused by the hot dry weather.

Genetics is also a prominent factor in fertility and accounts for about one third of the decline in pregnancy rate of dairy cows Shook 2006 . In particular identifying highly fertile bulls has been a time consuming and expensive process. It can take 5 10 years of tracking the attempts of artificial insemination using semen from a bull before it can be certified as a quality bull.

Marker assisted selection on the other hand can lower the high cost and reduce the extended time commitment of progeny testing currently used to improve sires since young bull progeny could be evaluated immediately after birth or even prior to birth for the presence absence of the marker and young bulls that are determined by genetic testing to have undesirable markers would never be progeny tested.

There is thus a need for a method of genetically evaluating the bulls as well as the cows e.g. by genetic testing to enable a quick and accurate evaluation of its fertility as well as the survival rate of embryos conceived therefrom.

Heat shock proteins HSPs are among the most highly conserved proteins in nature and have been found in all organisms studied from bacteria to humans Becker and Craig 1994 . The structure and roles of HSPs as molecular chaperones in the folding transport and assembly of proteins as well as in protecting the cell under different stress conditions have been extensively studied and reported in the scientific literature Becker and Craig 1994 Nollen and Morimoto 2002 Qiu et al. 2006 . The fact that HSPs are essential in the folding stability and cellular localization of newly synthesized proteins implies key roles of these proteins in apoptosis cell differentiation and regulation of the embryo cell cycle Luft and Dix 1999 Lanneau et al. 2007 . Strong evidence which has accumulated on the expression of HSPs during spermatogenesis oogenesis and embryogenesis suggests they have important functions in fertilization and during the pre implantation period Neuer et al. 1999 . Mouse embryos cultured with monoclonal antibodies to HSPs have been found to display a significantly reduced blastocyst rate Neuer et al. 1998 . Al Katanani and Hansen 2002 reported that the addition of antibodies for the induced form of HSP70 reduced blastocyst rate of cattle embryos suggesting that HSP70 is involved in proper embryonic development. Matwee and colleagues 2001 showed that fertilization measured as the number of permatozoa tightly bound to a zona pellucida and embryo development in cattle were significantly affected by the presence of different concentrations of anti HSP70.

Although there is strong evidence in the literature on the roles of HSPs in early embryonic development most of the studies have focused on the mouse and only a few HSP genes have been studied in cattle embryos. No evidence existed that any polymorphism in HSPs if existed is related to dairy cattle fertility in any way.

The present inventor investigated the expression profiles of HSPs and their splice variants in bovine embryos degenerates vs. blastocysts and also analyzed the association of these profiles with fertility traits. Some splice variants showed differential expression between degenerates and blastocysts while others were not expressed at all in embryos implying different functions of these transcripts in embryonic development. Among the HSPs investigated DNAJC15 DNAJC19 DNAJC24 and DNAJC27 all of the HSP40 family had the most significant expression differential. They were further investigated for association with fertility and development traits. Single nucleotide polymorphisms SNP in DNAJC15 and DNAJC27 were found to be associated with blastocyst rate and fertilization rate respectively.

Accordingly the present invention provides an isolated nucleic acid molecule comprising at least one polymorphic site selected from the group consisting of positions 85146 85161 85216 85292 and 85300 of the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 1 part of the DNAJC15 gene and at least 10 contiguous nucleotides of the sequence shown in wherein position 85146 is guanine position 85161 is guanine position 85216 is adenosine position 85292 is cytosine or position 85300 is guanine or an isolated nucleic acid molecule comprising a polymorphic position selected from the group consisting of positions 35728 36016 and 38867 of the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 2 part of the DNAJC27 gene and at least 10 contiguous nucleotides of the sequence shown in wherein position 35728 is guanine position 36016 is guanine or position 38867 is guanine.

The present inventor has constructed an in vitro fertilization IVF system which has the advantages of a unified environment and well isolated components of the embryonic development process and used this system to characterize genetic factors involved in embryonic loss and hence infertility and to associate candidate genes and pathways with fertilization rate and embryonic survival at both the genomic and gene expression levels Khatib et al. 2008a b Khatib et al. 2009 Huang et al. 2010a b .

As indicated above HSPs are among the first proteins produced during embryonic development Neuer et al. 1999 . The present inventor hypothesized that determining expression patterns of these genes in developed vs. arrested embryos could lead to the identification of specific genes involved in reproductive success. The high structural and functional conservation of HSPs during evolution suggests crucial roles of these proteins in fertilization embryo development and thus fertility in cattle. Also some HSPs are considered housekeeping genes that are essential for many cell functions.

In efforts leading to the present invention the expression levels of HSP genes in biological replicate bovine embryo pools that differ in their morphology and developmental statuses were evaluated and associations of polymorphisms with fertility traits were examined. The HSP genes were found to be differentially expressed between blastocysts and degenerate embryos.

SNPs in two HSP genes were found to be associated with fertility traits. Specifically a total of 17 candidate genes were chosen based on differential expression results observed in a previous microarray analysis of bovine embryos. To test whether or not these genes have roles in early development of cattle embryos their expression levels were quantified and compared between blastocysts and degenerates. All 17 genes showed expression differences that ranged between 1.5 and 7.6 fold between the embryo groups. Two of these bovine HSP genes DNAJC15 and DNAJC27 both of the HSP40 gene family have several polymorphic positions and these polymorphisms are associated with fertilization and blastocyst rates. Furthermore all SNPs in each of DNAJC15 and DNAJC27 genes showed high linkage disequilibrium with each other.

The term polymorphic or polymorphism as used herein refers to the occurrence of two or more alternative genomic sequences or alleles between or among different genomes or individuals. Polymorphic refers to the condition in which two or more variants of a specific genomic sequence can be found in a population. A polymorphic site is the locus at which the variation occurs. Polymorphisms generally have at least two alleles each occurring at a significant frequency in a selected population. A polymorphic locus may be as small as one base pair. The first identified allelic form is arbitrarily designated as the reference form and other allelic forms are designated as alternative or variant alleles. The allelic form occurring most frequently in a selected population is sometimes referred to as the wild type form. Diploid organisms may be homozygous or heterozygous for allelic forms. A biallelic polymorphism has two forms and a triallelic polymorphism has three forms and so on.

Polymorphisms may provide functional differences in the genetic sequence through changes in the encoded polypeptide changes in mRNA stability binding of transcriptional and translation factors to the DNA or RNA and the like. Polymorphisms are also used to detect genetic linkage to phenotypic variation.

One type of polymorphism single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs has gained wide use for the detection of genetic linkage recently. SNPs are generally biallelic systems that is there are two alleles that an individual may have for any particular SNP marker. In the instant case the SNPs are used for determining the genotypes of the two HSP genes which are found to have strong correlation to fertilization rate and embryonic survival.

The provided sequences also encompass the complementary sequence corresponding to any of the provided polymorphisms. In order to provide an unambiguous identification of the specific site of a polymorphism the numbering of the original sequence in the GenBank is shown in and is used throughout this disclosure.

The present invention provides nucleic acid based genetic markers for identifying bovine animals with superior breeding such as fertility and embryo survival rates traits. In general for use as markers nucleic acid fragments preferably DNA fragments may be as short as 7 nucleotides nt but may preferably be at least 12 nt 15 nt usually at least 20 nt often at least 50 nt. Such small DNA fragments are useful as primers for the polymerase chain reaction PCR and or probes for hybridization screening etc.

The term primer refers to a single stranded oligonucleotide capable of acting as a point of initiation of template directed DNA synthesis under appropriate conditions i.e. in the presence of four different nucleoside triphosphates and an agent for polymerization such as DNA or RNA polymerase or reverse transcriptase in an appropriate buffer and at a suitable temperature. The appropriate length of a primer depends on the intended use of the primer but typically ranges from 15 to 30 nucleotides. Short primer molecules generally require cooler temperatures to form sufficiently stable hybrid complexes with the template. A primer need not reflect the exact sequence of the template but must be sufficiently complementary to hybridize with the template. The term primer site or priming site refers to the area of the target DNA to which a primer hybridizes. The term primer pair means a set of primers including a 5 upstream primer that hybridizes with the 5 end of the DNA sequence to be amplified and a 3 downstream primer that hybridizes with the complement of the 3 end of the sequence to be amplified.

The term probe or hybridization probe denotes a defined nucleic acid segment or nucleotide analog segment which can be used to identify by hybridizing to a specific polynucleotide sequence present in samples said nucleic acid segment comprising a nucleotide sequence complementary of the specific polynucleotide sequence to be identified. Probes or hybridization probes are nucleic acids capable of binding in a base specific manner to a complementary strand of nucleic acid.

An objective of the present invention is SNP genotyping that is to determine which embodiment of the SNP polymorphisms a specific sample of DNA has. For example it is desirable to determine whether the nucleotide at a particular position is A or C. Many references describe genotyping methods such as Chen et al. Single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping biochemistry protocol cost and throughput Pharmacogenomics J. 2003 3 2 77 96 Kwok et al. Detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms Curr Issues Mol. Biol. April 2003 5 2 43 60 Shi Technologies for individual genotyping detection of genetic polymorphisms in drug targets and disease genes Am J. Pharmacogenomics. 2002 2 3 197 205 and Kwok Methods for genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms Annu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. 2001 2 235 58. Exemplary techniques for high throughput SNP genotyping are described in Marnellos High throughput SNP analysis for genetic association studies Curr Opin Drug Discov Devel. May 2003 6 3 317 21. Common SNP genotyping methods include but are not limited to TaqMan assays and modifications thereof such as Molecular Beacon assays SNPlex platforms Bio Plex system CEQ and SNPstream systems Molecular Inversion Probe array technology BeadArray Technologies e.g. Illumina GoldenGate and Infinium assays single stranded conformation polymorphism assays SSCP molecular beacon assays nucleic acid arrays allele specific primer extension allele specific PCR arrayed primer extension homogeneous primer extension assays primer extension with detection by mass spectrometry pyrosequencing multiplex primer extension sorted on genetic arrays ligation with rolling circle amplification homogeneous ligation OLA U.S. Pat. No. 4 988 167 multiplex ligation reaction sorted on genetic arrays restriction fragment length polymorphism single base extension tag assays and the Invader assay. Such methods may be used in combination with detection mechanisms such as for example luminescence or chemiluminescence detection fluorescence detection time resolved fluorescence detection fluorescence resonance energy transfer fluorescence polarization mass spectrometry and electrical detection.

The sequence neighboring the SNP site can be used to design SNP detection reagents such as oligonucleotide probes which may optionally be implemented in a kit format. Preferably the oligonucleotide probe will have a detectable label and contains for example an A at the corresponding position. Experimental conditions can be chosen such that if the sample DNA contains an A a hybridization signal can be detected because the probe hybridizes to the corresponding complementary DNA strand in the sample while if the sample DNA contains a G no hybridization signal is detected.

Similarly PCR primers and conditions can be devised whereby the oligonucleotide is used as one of the PCR primers for analyzing nucleic acids for the presence of a specific sequence. These may be direct amplification of the genomic DNA or RT PCR amplification of the mRNA transcript of the target gene. The use of the polymerase chain reaction is described in Saiki et al. 1985 Science 230 1350 1354. Amplification may be used to determine whether a polymorphism is present by using a primer that is specific for the polymorphism. Alternatively various methods are known in the art that utilize oligonucleotide ligation as a means of detecting polymorphisms for examples see Riley et al 1990 Nucleic Acids Res. 18 2887 2890 and Delahunty et al 1996 Am. J. Hum. Genet. 58 1239 1246. The detection method may also be based on direct DNA sequencing or hybridization or a combination thereof. Where large amounts of DNA are available genomic DNA is used directly. Alternatively the region of interest is cloned into a suitable vector and grown in sufficient quantity for analysis. The nucleic acid may be amplified by PCR to provide sufficient amounts for analysis.

Hybridization may be performed in solution or such hybridization may be performed when either the oligonucleotide probe or the target polynucleotide is covalently or noncovalently affixed to a solid support. Attachment may be mediated for example by antibody antigen interactions poly L Lys streptavidin or avidin biotin salt bridges hydrophobic interactions chemical linkages UV cross linking baking etc. Oligonucleotides may be synthesized directly on the solid support or attached to the solid support subsequent to synthesis. Solid supports suitable for use in detection methods of the invention include substrates made of silicon glass plastic paper and the like which may be formed for example into wells as in 96 well plates slides sheets membranes fibers chips dishes and beads. The solid support may be treated coated or derivatized to facilitate the immobilization of the allele specific oligonucleotide or target nucleic acid. For screening purposes hybridization probes of the polymorphic sequences may be used where both forms are present either in separate reactions spatially separated on a solid phase matrix or labeled such that they can be distinguished from each other.

Hybridization may also be performed with nucleic acid arrays and subarrays such as described in WO 95 11995. The arrays would contain a battery of allele specific oligonucleotides representing each of the polymorphic sites. One or both polymorphic forms may be present in the array for example the polymorphism of a SNP position may be represented by either or both of the listed nucleotides. Usually such an array will include at least 2 different polymorphic sequences i.e. polymorphisms located at unique positions within the locus and may include all of the provided polymorphisms. Arrays of interest may further comprise sequences including polymorphisms of other genetic sequences particularly other sequences of interest. The oligonucleotide sequence on the array will usually be at least about 12 nt in length may be the length of the provided polymorphic sequences or may extend into the flanking regions to generate fragments of 100 to 200 nt in length. For examples of arrays see Ramsay 1998 Nat. Biotech. 16 4044 Hacia et al. 1996 Nature Genetics 14 441 447 Lockhart et al. 1996 Nature Biotechnol. 14 1675 1680 and De Risi et al. 1996 Nature Genetics 14 457 460.

The identity of polymorphisms may also be determined using a mismatch detection technique including but not limited to the RNase protection method using riboprobes Winter et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82 7575 1985 Meyers et al. Science 230 1242 1985 and proteins which recognize nucleotide mismatches such as the mutS protein Modrich P. Ann. Rev. Genet. 25 229 253 1991 . Alternatively variant alleles can be identified by single strand conformation polymorphism SSCP analysis discussed above Orita et al. Genomics 5 874 879 1989 Humphries et al. in Molecular Diagnosis of Genetic Diseases R. Elles ed. pp. 321 340 1996 or denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis DGGE Wartell et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 18 2699 2706 1990 Sheffield et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 232 236 1989 .

A polymerase mediated primer extension method may also be used to identify the polymorphism s . Several such methods have been described in the patent and scientific literature and include the Genetic Bit Analysis method WO92 15712 and the ligase polymerase mediated genetic bit analysis U.S. Pat. No. 5 679 524 . Related methods are disclosed in WO91 02087 WO90 09455 WO95 17676 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 302 509 and 5 945 283. Extended primers containing a polymorphism may be detected by mass spectrometry as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 605 798. Another primer extension method is allele specific PCR Ruao et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 17 8392 1989 Ruao et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 19 6877 6882 1991 WO 93 22456 Turki et al. J. Clin. Invest. 95 1635 1641 1995 . In addition multiple polymorphic sites may be investigated by simultaneously amplifying multiple regions of the nucleic acid using sets of allele specific primers as described in Wallace et al. WO 89 10414 .

A detectable label may be included in an amplification reaction. Suitable labels include fluorochromes e.g. fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC rhodamine Texas Red phycoerythrin allophycocyanin 6 carboxyfluorescein 6 FAM 2 7 dimethoxy 4 5 dichloro 6 carboxyfluorescein JOE 6 carboxy X rhodamine ROX 6 carboxy 2 4 7 4 7 hexachlorofluorescein HEX 5 carboxyfluorescein 5 FAM or N N N N tetramethyl 6 carboxyrhodamine TAMRA radioactive labels e.g. P S H etc. The label may be a two stage system where the amplified DNA is conjugated to biotin haptens etc. having a high affinity binding partner e.g. avidin specific antibodies etc. where the binding partner is conjugated to a detectable label. The label may be conjugated to one or both of the primers. Alternatively the pool of nucleotides used in the amplification is labeled so as to incorporate the label into the amplification product.

It is readily recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the art that in order to maximize the signal to noise ratio in probe hybridization detection procedure the polymorphic site should at the center of the probe fragment used whereby a mismatch has a maximum effect on destabilizing the hybrid molecule and in a PCR detection procedure the polymorphic site should be placed at the very 3 end of the primer whereby a mismatch has the maximum effect on preventing a chain elongation reaction by the DNA polymerase. The location of nucleotides in a polynucleotide with respect to the center of the polynucleotide are described herein in the following manner. When a polynucleotide has an odd number of nucleotides the nucleotide at an equal distance from the 3 and 5 ends of the polynucleotide is considered to be at the center of the polynucleotide and any nucleotide immediately adjacent to the nucleotide at the center or the nucleotide at the center itself is considered to be within 1 nucleotide of the center. With an odd number of nucleotides in a polynucleotide any of the five nucleotides positions in the middle of the polynucleotide would be considered to be within 2 nucleotides of the center and so on. When a polynucleotide has an even number of nucleotides there would be a bond and not a nucleotide at the center of the polynucleotide. Thus either of the two central nucleotides would be considered to be within 1 nucleotide of the center and any of the four nucleotides in the middle of the polynucleotide would be considered to be within 2 nucleotides of the center and so on.

In some embodiments a composition contains two or more differently labeled oligonucleotides for simultaneously probing the identity of nucleotides or nucleotide pairs at two or more polymorphic sites. It is also contemplated that primer compositions may contain two or more sets of allele specific primer pairs to allow simultaneous targeting and amplification of two or more regions containing a polymorphic site.

Alternatively the relevant portion of the target gene of the sample of interest may be amplified via PCR and directly sequenced and the sequence be compared to the wild type sequence. It is readily recognized that other than those specifically disclosed herein numerous primers can be devised to achieve the objectives. PCR and sequencing techniques are well known in the art and reagents and equipments are readily available commercially.

The so called next generation sequencing and high throughput sequencing methods may also be sued. For example Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing MPSS Polony sequencing pyro sequencing SOLiD sequencing ion semiconductor sequencing and DNA nanoball sequencing systems are well known to those skilled in the art.

DNA markers have several advantages segregation is easy to measure and is unambiguous and DNA markers are co dominant i.e. heterozygous and homozygous animals can be distinctively identified. Once a marker system is established selection decisions could be made very easily since DNA markers can be assayed any time after a sample is collected from the individual animal or even earlier by testing embryos in vitro if very early embryos are collected. The use of marker assisted genetic selection will greatly facilitate and speed up cattle breeding problems. For example a modification of the multiple ovulation and embryo transfer MOET procedure can be used with genetic marker technology. Specifically females are superovulated eggs are collected in vitro fertilized using semen from superior males and implanted into other females allowing for use of the superior genetics of the female as well as the male without having to wait for her to give birth to one calf at a time. Developing blastomeres at the 4 8 cell stage may be assayed for presence of the marker and selection decisions made accordingly.

In one embodiment of the invention an assay is provided for detection of presence of a desirable genotype using the markers.

The term genotype as used herein refers to the identity of the alleles present in an individual or a sample. In the context of the present invention a genotype preferably refers to the description of the polymorphic alleles present in an individual or a sample. The term genotyping a sample or an individual for a polymorphic marker refers to determining the specific allele or the specific nucleotide carried by an individual at a polymorphic marker.

The present invention is suitable for identifying a bovine including a young or adult bovine animal an embryo a semen sample an egg a fertilized egg or a zygote or other cell or tissue sample therefrom to determine whether said bovine possesses the desired genotypes of the present invention some of which are indicative of improved fertilization rate and embryonic survival.

Further provided is a method for genotyping the bovine HSP gene comprising determining for the two copies of the HSP gene present the identity of the nucleotide pair at positions 25402 and 19069.

One embodiment of a genotyping method of the invention involves examining both copies of the relevant HSP gene or a fragment thereof to identify the nucleotide pair at the polymorphic site in the two copies to assign a genotype to the individual. In some embodiments examining a gene may include examining one or more of DNA containing the gene mRNA transcripts thereof or cDNA copies thereof. As will be readily understood by the skilled artisan the two copies of a gene mRNA or cDNA or fragment thereof in an individual may be the same allele or may be different alleles. In another embodiment a genotyping method of the invention comprises determining the identity of the nucleotide pair at the polymorphic site.

The present invention further provides a kit for genotyping a bovine sample the kit comprising in a container a nucleic acid molecule as described above designed for detecting the polymorphism and optionally at least another component for carrying out such detection. Preferably a kit comprises at least two oligonucleotides packaged in the same or separate containers. The kit may also contain other components such as hybridization buffer where the oligonucleotides are to be used as a probe packaged in a separate container. Alternatively where the oligonucleotides are to be used to amplify a target region the kit may contain preferably packaged in separate containers a polymerase and a reaction buffer optimized for primer extension mediated by the polymerase such as PCR.

In one embodiment the present invention provides a breeding method whereby genotyping as described above is conducted on bovine embryos and based on the results certain cattle are either selected or dropped out of the breeding program.

Through use of the linked marker loci procedures termed marker assisted selection MAS may be used for genetic improvement within a breeding nucleus or marker assisted introgression for transferring useful alleles from a resource population to a breeding nucleus Soller 1990 Soller 1994 .

The roles of 17 HSP genes in early embryonic development and fertility in cattle at both genomic and gene expression levels were investigated. These genes include 8 HSP40 genes six HSP70 genes one HSPP and 2 HSP10 genes. see Table 1 These genes were chosen based on differential expression results observed in a previous microarray analysis of bovine embryos and their expression levels were quantified and compared between blastocysts and degenerates to test whether or not these genes have roles in early development of cattle embryos.

All 17 genes showed expression differences that ranged between 1.5 and 7.6 fold between the embryo groups. All HSP40 family genes were found to be upregulated in degenerate embryos compared to blastocysts. Although the specific functions of HSP40s have not been reported in cattle studies from other species have shown that these genes play important roles in protecting cells under stress conditions Lanneau et al. 2007 . It is well established that ATP hydrolysis is necessary for protein folding activity of HSP70s and that HSP40s stimulate ATPase activity and stabilize the interaction of HSP70s with their substrates Qiu et al. 2006 . Gotoh and colleagues 2004 reported that HSP40 combines with HSP70 to act as chaperones to protect cells from apoptosis. Degenerate embryos in the IVF system are growth arrested embryos and seem to undergo partial apoptosis. Research has shown that HSPs are upregulated to prevent apoptosis triggered by different stimuli by interacting with key factors of the apoptotic signaling pathways Lanneau et al. 2007 . Therefore it is feasible that upregulation of HSP40 genes observed in degenerates is a response to stress on these embryos so they can maintain protein homeostasis.

The qRT PCR analysis revealed moderate fold change expression of HSPE1 HSPH1 HSB1 and six HSP70 genes HSPA2 HSPA4 HSPA5 HSPA8 HSPA9 and HSPA14 . HSPA2 HSPA4 HSPA5 and HSPA8 showed higher expression in blastocysts than degenerates whereas expression levels of HSPA9 and HSPA14 were higher in degenerate embryos. Although the specific functions of most HSP70s have not been reported in cattle studies in human and mouse have indicated important roles for these genes in early embryogenesis. It has been reported that Hspa2 is essential for normal spermatogenesis and for growth and survival of cancer cells and that Hspa8 knockout mice are not viable because of the housekeeping functions of this gene Daugaard et al. 2007 . Human HSPA5 is involved in the folding and transport of proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum and Hspa5 knockout mice embryos die at day 3.5 and therefore it too is considered a housekeeping gene Daugaard et al. 2007 . Furthermore Matwee et al. 2001 have reported a reduced blastocyst rate and an increased apoptosis of embryos cultured in the presence of anti HSP70. Thus upregulation and downregulation of HSPs in bovine embryos observed in the present study imply that these genes play vital roles in early embryo development.

Given that alternative splicing is a major source of phenotypic complexity in mammals Wang et al. 2008 a search was conducted of the Ensembl annotation of the bovine genome and found that only 4 out of 17 HSP candidate genes have annotated splice variants. In contrast for the 17 human and mouse counterparts 15 and 13 genes respectively have 2 or more splice variants. The low number of alternative transcripts identified in cattle is presumably due to the incomplete annotation of the bovine genome. Indeed in a previous study thousands of alternative splicing events were characterized in blastocysts and degenerative embryos and some of those events were found to be associated with the developmental status of embryos Huang and Khatib 2010 .

In order to explore the effects of the different splice variants of HSPs on embryo development expression levels of the identified variants were estimated and compared between blastocysts and degenerate embryos. The results clearly show that different splice variants display different expression levels which imply different functions in embryo development. For example while the long variant of DNAJC24 was highly expressed in degenerate embryos compared to blastocysts the short variant of this gene was found to be lowly expressed in both embryo groups. Also for DNAJC5 one transcript could not be detected using qRT PCR. These results are consistent with human studies in which only some of the splice variants of genes were found to be associated with a disease state Wang and Cooper 2007 . Collectively these results testify to the importance of alternative splicing as a key regulator of phenotypic variation in mammals.

To better understand the involvement of the HSP genes in fertility traits 4 genes that showed the most significant expression differences between embryo groups were tested for SNP association.

Recently an IVF experimental system in cattle has been developed in our laboratory see Methods aimed at identifying genetic factors affecting fertilization and embryo development. The effectiveness of this system in identifying genes and pathways associated with developmental and fertility traits has been demonstrated in several studies Khatib et al. 2008a b Khatib et al. 2009 Driver et al. 2009 Wang et al. 2009 Huang et al. 2010a .

Analysis of DNAJC15 and DNAJC27 SNP revealed significant associations with blastocyst and fertilization rates respectively. These results are of particular significance because these 2 genes showed a remarkable difference in expression between blastocysts and degenerate embryos providing strong evidence for the involvement of these genes in embryo production and development in cattle. The results also provide further evidence for the roles of HSPs in the fertilization process and blastocyst rates observed in mice and cattle in previous studies. Neuer et al. 1998 found that the presence of anti HSP60 monoclonal antibodies had significant effects on blastocyst rates of mouse embryos. Matwee et al. 2001 reported that the addition of anti HSP70 monoclonal antibodies to the culture medium reduced the mean number of spermatozoa bound to zona pellucida by about 50 to that of controls. Also the authors reported that anti HSP70 significantly reduced the number of bovine embryos that reached the blastocyst stage Matwee et al. 2001 . A recent study by Rosenkrans et al. 2010 reported an association between SNP in the promoter region of HSP70 and calving percentages in Brahman cows. Although a small sample size was used in the association analysis the results point to an important role of HSP70 in cow fertility.

The identification of specific HSP genes contributing to embryo survival can be a unique opportunity to improve protection of IVF embryos from different toxic conditions and to enhance pregnancy rates in cattle Hansen 2007 . HSP genes investigated in this study were found to be differentially expressed between blastocysts and degenerate embryos and SNP in 2 genes were associated with fertility traits. Blastocysts and degenerate embryos have distinct morphological and developmental features. As such the present study provides a set of candidate genetic markers for pre implantation embryo development. However it has been reported that relatively small changes decrease or increase in expression levels of heat shock proteins can result in growth abnormalities and cell death Nollen and Morimoto 2002 . Also the assessment of the expression of alternative transcript isoforms in the embryos examined in this study testifies to the importance of inclusion of this approach in studying gene expression.

The present invention accordingly provides novel cattle genotyping selective cattle breeding and related methods based on the discovery that certain HSP40 polymorphism confers improved fertilization and embryonic survival rate to cattle.

The following examples are intended to illustrate preferred embodiments of the invention and should not be interpreted to limit the scope of the invention as defined in the claims.

In this study fertilization and embryo production were performed in 2 different experiments. The first experiment is a comparison of expression profiles of 17 HSPs between 2 populations of embryos differing in their morphology and the second experiment is a genomic association analysis of genes found to be differentially expressed in the first experiment with fertilization and blastocyst rates.

Ovaries were obtained from a local abattoir and processed for IVF using standard protocol Huang et al. 2010b Khatib et al. 2008a . Briefly oocytes were aspirated from 2 6 mm follicles and washed in Tyrode s albumin lactate pyruvate TALP Hepes after which they underwent maturation in supplemented M199 media Khatib et al. 2008a . Incubation was completed at 5 COin air at 39 C. and high humidity for 22 24 hours at which time oocytes were then washed in TALP Hepes and moved into fresh IVF TALP Biowhittaker Walkersburg Md. . Semen samples from 2 different bulls were used for fertilization sperm underwent Percoll separation 45 90 gradient and were adjusted to a final concentration of 1 10 ml Parrish et al. 1995 . Fertilization was marked as day 0 of development and completed by combining sperm heparin and PHE with the oocytes in 44 l drops of media Khatib et al. 2008a . Incubation was then continued for 22 24 hours after which the putative zygotes were washed in TALP Hepes denuded of remaining cumulus cell complexes and placed into supplemented synthetic oviductal fluid Biowhittaker and returned to incubation Khatib et al. 2008a .

Putative zygotes were cultured over an 8 day period during which assessments of their developmental progress were made. By day 5 of development a bovine embryo should attain approximately 16 32 cells and show signs of cellular compaction deeming it as morula. Embryos failing to show these characteristics were assumed to have been arrested in development and were excluded from analysis. Morulas were then continued in culture until day 8. By this time an embryo should show evidence of a fluid filled cavity blastocoele which gives rise to the differentiation of the inner cell mass and the trophectoderm qualifying it as a blastocyst. For expression analysis there were 2 populations of embryos collected. The first consisted of embryos that attained a compacted morula status by day 5 but failed to form a blastocoele by day 8 referred as degenerate embryos. The second consisted of embryos that developed into blastocysts by day 8. Embryos from each morphological group were collected in pools of 20 and preserved in RNALater Ambion Austin Tex. . Two bulls were used with 2 sets of biological replicate pools total of 4 biological replicates from each to prevent maternal crossover.

A previous study in our laboratory using microarray expression analysis has revealed that many genes are differentially expressed between blastocysts and degenerate embryos Huang et al. 2010b . Seventeen HSP genes that showed 1.5 fold or higher differences in expression between the embryo groups described in the study of Huang et al. 2010b were chosen for validation of differential expression and further investigation in new sets of blastocysts and degenerate embryo pools using qRT PCR analysis. Primers Table 1 were designed to amplify fragments spanning more than one exon to exclude the possibility of genomic DNA contamination in the qRT PCR reactions using the Beacon Designer software Premier Biosoft International Palo Alto Calif. . Total RNA was extracted from pools of embryos using RNaqueous Micro Ambion and quality controlled using a RNA6000 PicoChip Agilent Technologies CA . Messenger RNA was amplified using MessageAmp II Ambion Austin Tex. followed by cDNA synthesis using iScript Bio Rad Hercules Calif. according to manufacturers instructions. Reactions of qRT PCR were run on a DNA Engine Opticon 2 Detection System MJ Research Watertown Mass. using iQ SYBR Green Supermix kit Bio Rad Laboratories CA . Each sample was run in quadruplicate and all 4 expression results were averaged. Analysis of gene expression levels was conducted using the 2method Livak and Schmittgen 2001 . The selection of the housekeeping gene GAPDH as an endogenous control was as described in Huang et al. 2010b .

Experiment II Association Analysis of Differentially Expressed HSPs with Fertilization and Blastocyst Rates

In order to further investigate the involvement in fertility of genes DNAJC15 DNAJC19 DNAJC24 and DNAJC27 that showed the highest fold change in expression in degenerate embryos vs. blastocysts an association analysis between SNPs in these genes and 2 main fertility traits fertilization rate and blastocyst rate was performed. Using the IVF experimental system several genes were found to be significantly associated with variation in fertilization and embryonic survival rates Khatib et al. 2008a b Khatib et al. 2009 .

Phenotypic Data. In order to generate phenotypic data for association analysis a total of 6 893 in vitro fertilizations were performed using oocytes from 399 ovaries obtained from 399 Holstein cows and semen samples from 12 Holstein bulls. For 92 ovaries oocytes were fertilized by two different bulls each. Fertilization rate was calculated as the number of cleaved embryos 48 h postfertilization out of the total number of oocytes exposed to sperm. Blastocyst rate was calculated as the number of embryos that reached blastocyst stage out of the total embryos cultured by day 8. asdf

Genotyping. DNA was extracted from ovaries n 399 using standard phenol chloroform protocols. The DNA concentrations were measured using a spectrophotometer Ultraspec 2100 Amersham Biosciences . For polymorphism identification 3 DNA pools were constructed from 20 different ovary cow samples to contain 25 ng of DNA from each sample. DNA Pools were amplified with different sets of primers designed from the coding and 5 and 3 UTR regions of the 4 candidate genes Table 3 . Amplification sequencing of PCR products and SNP identification were as described in Khatib et al. 2008a b . SNP identified in DNAJC15 DNAJC19 DNAJC24 and DNAJC27 were genotyped for the 399 ovary cow samples at GeneSeek Lincoln Nebr. .

For expression analysis normalized gene expression values Ct were analyzed using a general linear model including the fixed effects of the bull the type of embryo blastocyst or degenerate and the random effect of the pool. Association between the normalized gene expression and the type of embryo was tested using a likelihood ratio test by comparing this model to a reduced model without the embryo effect. The mean and the range of the fold change for each gene were calculated as 2using the estimated Ct value standard error.

For genomic association analysis between SNP and fertilization and blastocyst rates the following mixed linear model was used SNP where yrepresents in turn the fertilization or survival rate of oocytes k from ovary i fertilized with semen from bull j represents a general mean for the trait considered orepresents the random effect of the individual ovary from which oocytes were harvested brepresents the random effect of the sire used in the fertilization SNPrepresents the fixed effect of the genotypic class for the SNP considered and erepresents the residuals assumed normal independent and identically distributed with mean 0 an variance I . Ovaries and bulls were assumed uncorrelated with variance structures I and I respectively. Association between the SNP and fertilization or blastocyst rates was tested using a likelihood ratio test by comparing the full model to a reduced model without the SNP effect. All analyses were performed using the lme4 package of R language environment R Development Core Team 2009 .

Expression differences between degenerate embryos and blastocysts were estimated for 17 HSP genes in 4 sets of biological replicates using qRT PCR . A range of 1.5 to 7.6 fold difference in expression was observed between embryo groups. Interestingly all HSP40 gene family members were found to be upregulated in degenerate embryos compared to blastocysts . For example DNAJC15 P

Splice variants of HSP genes were identified using the genebuild procedure of Ensembl http uswest.ensembl.org . In this procedure annotation of transcripts is based on mRNA and protein sequences deposited in public scientific databases. Ensembl search revealed one transcript per gene for 13 genes 2 transcripts each for DNAJB12 and DNAJC19 and 3 transcripts each for DNAJC5 and DNAJC24. Expression levels of splice variants of DNAJC5 DNAJC19 DNAJC24 and DNAJB12 were estimated in 4 sets of biological replicates of blastocysts and degenerate embryos using qRT PCR. Transcripts DNAJC5 1049 and DNAJC5 667 showed 2.53 and 1.67 fold higher expression respectively in degenerate embryos compared to blastocysts while the DNAJC5 725 transcript was not detected in any of the embryo groups. For DNAJC19 only transcript DNAJC19 536 was detected in embryos. For DNAJC24 DNAJC24 2172 transcript showed a 3.22 fold higher expression in degenerate embryos compared to blastocysts whereas transcript DNAJC24 628 was lowly expressed in all embryo samples. DNAJC24 1893 transcript could not be detected in embryos. The sequences of the 2 DNAJB12 transcripts were overlapping so that only transcript DNAB12 1220 could be amplified using transcript specific primers. DNAB12 1220 showed a 1.95 fold higher expression in degenerate embryos vs. blastocysts.

SNP in genes DNAJC15 DNAJC19 DNAJC24 and DNAJC27 were tested for association with fertilization and blastocyst rates. These genes showed the highest fold differences in expression between embryo groups and the highest statistical significance in the general linear model analysis P
