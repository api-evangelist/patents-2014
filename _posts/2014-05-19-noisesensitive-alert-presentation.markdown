title: Noise-sensitive alert presentation
abstract: Many devices are configured to present alerts notifying a user of device events, but the user may not notice the alert due to a noisy environment. A user may mitigate missed alerts by increasing the alert volume or choosing a vibration mode, but such techniques depend upon the knowledge, attention, and memory of the user to adjust the device before the alert. Instead, a device may compare the noise level of the environment with a noise level threshold. If the noise level is below the threshold, the device presents the alert; but if the noise level is above the threshold, the device defers the presentation of the alert until the noise level diminishes below the threshold, and then presents the alert. The device may also send an automated response to the message, notifying a sender that the user may return the message upon leaving the noisy environment.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve the presentation of an alert on a device such as a ringtone or vibration presented to a user by a mobile phone upon receiving an incoming call or text message. In such scenarios the noise of the environment may affect the user s ability to hear the alert which may cause the user to miss a time sensitive alert such as a request for a realtime communication session e.g. an incoming phone call or video chat request . The user may utilize a variety of techniques to cope with the noise of the environment such as increasing the volume of the device to make the alert noticeable over the noise of the environment. If the noise in the environment is of a particular type the user may switch the alert of the device from a first sensory modality that matches the noise to an alternative sensory modality that does not match the noise e.g. in an environment with a loud volume of sound the user may switch from a sound based alert to a vibration based alert . If the user misses the alert the device may log the missed alert and present a message that the user may notice during or after the time of the alert.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

While the techniques described above may enable a user to mitigate the noise of the environment in the context of presented alerts these techniques may present a few disadvantages. For example mitigation techniques that involve the attention of the user may be inadequate as the user may have limited attention for managing the device or limited patience in adapting the volume of the device a changing noise level of the environment. Additionally techniques such as increasing the volume of a ringtone may be unpleasant e.g. in a noisy environment a ringtone that is loud enough to overcome the noise level may also irritate other individuals and may be embarrassing if the user fails to reset it when the noise level subsides e.g. a very loud ringtone that is audible in a noisy environment may be piercing if the user transitions to a quiet environment .

As another example even if the user receives the alert from the device the user may not be able to respond due to the noise level e.g. the user may not wish to accept a call in a noisy environment when the user and the caller would be unable to hear one another. Moreover unless the user informs the caller of why the user is unable to accept the call e.g. by sending a text message the caller is uninformed of the reason for the missed call.

Presented herein are techniques for configuring a device to present alerts that is sensitive to the noise level of the environment. In accordance with these techniques when a device is to present an alert to a user the device detects the noise level of the environment and compares the noise level with a noise level threshold. If the noise level is below the noise level threshold i.e. if the environment is sufficiently quiet for the user to receive the alert the device presents the alert to the user. However if the noise level is above the noise level threshold i.e. if the environment is too noisy for the user to receive the alert the device refrains from presenting the alert and instead defers the presentation of the alert until the device detects that the noise level has subsided below the noise level threshold. Optionally for an alert involving a caller the device may automatically send a message to the caller regarding the noise level e.g. notifying the caller that the user is unable to take a call due to a noisy environment. By refraining from presenting alerts in noisy environments when the user is unlikely to receive the alert the device may more conveniently interact with the user in a context aware manner in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

Devices are often configured to mitigate such circumstances in a variety of ways. As a first example the user may simply increase the volume of the alert in order to overcome the noise of the environment . As a second example the device may present to the user a notification regarding the missed alert which the user may notice and respond to at a second time . As a third example in anticipation of missing the alert due to the noise of the environment the user may toggle the presentation of alerts by the device switching from a first alert type that corresponds to the noise to a second alert type that does not correspond to the noise e.g. switching from an audio alert to a vibrational alert which may be more readily perceived in an environment featuring a high volume of sound noise but a lower volume of vibration noise . Thereafter at a second time an alert such as an incoming call is presented as a vibrational alert that is perceived by the user in spite of the sound noise of the environment .

While the techniques presented in the exemplary scenario of may enable the user to mitigate the missed perception of alerts such techniques may exhibit a variety of disadvantages.

As a first example mitigation techniques such as raising the volume or switching to a different alert modality are implemented by the user . However the user may be unable to reach the device to alter the settings in response e.g. if the device is in the user s pocket or bag may not have available attention to manage the alert settings of the device e.g. while the user is operating a vehicle may not want to spend time change the settings or may not understand how to change the setting. Additionally in some scenarios the user may incorrectly believe that the alert is perceivable over the noise of the environment .

As a second example techniques involving raising the volume of an alert e.g. the volume of a broadcast audio alert or the vibration strength of a vibrational alert may overcome the noise of the environment but may also result in an unpleasant experience for the user and or other nearby individuals e.g. an overly loud ringtone broadcast over a noisy conversation may be readily perceived by the user but may also irritate others in the vicinity. Additionally increasing the volume of the alert may deplete the battery of the device faster e.g. generating a stronger vibration may result in a faster rate of energy drain for the device .

As a third example mitigation techniques that involve altering the volume of the alert to adapt to the noise of the environment may have undesirable consequences when the noise of the environment changes. For example a user may increase the volume of a ringtone when the environment is noisy but forgets to turn the volume back down when the volume subsides or when the user transitions to a quieter environment . The resulting ringtone may be piercing and may be embarrassing for the user and irritating for others in the vicinity. Conversely the user may turn the alert volume of the device down when present in an environment with little noise such as a library but may not remember to restore the alert volume to a typical setting upon transitioning to an environment with a typical noise level and may therefore miss alerts due to the unusually low volume of the alert . Moreover the user may simply be unwilling to attend to the volume level of the device frequently as the noise of the environment changes.

As a fourth example some devices may only have one type of alert or only various types of alerts that are each obscured by the noise of the environment e.g. a mobile phone may have both an audio ringtone and a vibration module but the user may be present in an environment that is both too loud to hear the audio ringtone and too rough to feel a vibration alert . Thus the device may be incapable of presenting any type of alert that the user is capable of perceiving over the noise of the environment .

As a fifth example presenting a notification to the user of a missed alert such as a displayed message on a display of the device may be insufficient to bring the missed alert to the attention of the user . For example a user who is not anticipating an alert such as receiving a call may not check the device for such a notification and may not notice the notification until long after missing the alert . This result may arise because the device does not prompt the attention of the user at a later time but responds in a passive manner that is only noticeable when the user later initiates an interaction with the device .

As a sixth example when the alert involves a contact such as an individual placing a call to the user the interaction of the device with the user may fail to inform the contact of the interaction. For example the contact may wait while the device attempts to present the alert to the user and may then inform the contact that the user is unavailable and or transfer the contact to a voicemail box. However these responses may not inform the contact as to why the user is unavailable i.e. because of the noise of the environment but only that the user is unavailable. These and other disadvantages may arise from the missed alert mitigation techniques presented in the exemplary scenario of .

In this exemplary scenario at a first time a device of a user receives a call from a contact of the user and endeavors to present an alert to the user regarding the call . However before presenting the alert the device measures a noise level of the environment of the user and performs a comparison of the noise level of the noise of the environment with a noise level threshold e.g. determining whether the sound level of the environment is above or below a sound level threshold such as 65 decibels or the peak loudness of a typical level of conversation . Upon reaching a determination that the noise level is below the noise level threshold the device may present the alert to the user as an indication of the call from the contact . However upon reaching a determination that the noise level exceeds the noise level threshold the device may refrain from presenting the alert to the user and may instead store the alert in an alert storage e.g. a memory buffer for missed alerts . At a later time when the device reaches a determination that the noise level has diminished below the noise level threshold the device may present the alerts in the alert storage to the user e.g. providing an audio notification to the user indicating the missed call from the contact .

The configuration of a device to present an alert in accordance with the techniques presented herein such as illustrated in the exemplary scenario of may present a variety of technical effects as compared with other techniques including those illustrated in the exemplary scenario of .

As a first example the comparison of the noise level and the noise level threshold and determination of whether to present the alert or to defer such presentation until the noise level of the environment subsides are performed automatically by the device and do not involve the knowledge attention and memory of the user to adjust the operation of the device . As such the techniques are less prone to consequences due to the failure of the user to adjust the device to the current environment or the resetting of the device when leaving the environment .

As a second example the deferral of the presentation of the alert until a time when the alert is perceptible by the user rather than overcoming the noise level by increasing the volume of the alert reduces the unpleasantness of presenting an amplified alert to the user and other individuals.

As a third example the determination not to present an alert that is unlikely to be perceived by the user may conserve the battery power and other computational resources of the device .

As a fourth example the deferral of the presentation of the alert to a subsequent time and the actual presentation of the alert at a later time when the noise level diminishes below the noise level threshold enables the device to actively alert the user rather than passively presenting a notification such as a message that the user may not notice.

As a fifth example the comparison may be performed rapidly and may enable a prompt response to a contact rather than the contact having to wait while the device attempts in vain to alert the user and or may inform the contact of the reason that the user is unavailable i.e. due to the noise level of the environment . These and other technical effects may be achieved through the presentation of an alert in view of the noise level of the environment may be achieved through the implementation of the techniques presented herein.

The exemplary system includes an alert memory that upon receiving an alert stores the alert . The exemplary system also includes a noise level detector e.g. a microphone or a vibration sensor that detects a noise level of the environment of the user . The exemplary system also includes an alert presenter that while the alert memory stores at least one stored alert compares the noise level of the environment of the user to a noise level threshold . Upon determining that the noise level of the environment of the user is below the noise level threshold the alert presenter presents the at least one stored alert to the user and removes the at least one stored alert from the alert memory . In this manner the architecture and interoperation of the components of the exemplary system of enable the exemplary device to present alerts to the user in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

Still another embodiment involves a computer readable medium comprising processor executable instructions configured to apply the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may include e.g. computer readable storage devices involving a tangible device such as a memory semiconductor e.g. a semiconductor utilizing static random access memory SRAM dynamic random access memory DRAM and or synchronous dynamic random access memory SDRAM technologies a platter of a hard disk drive a flash memory device or a magnetic or optical disc such as a CD R DVD R or floppy disc encoding a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may also include as a class of technologies that are distinct from computer readable storage devices various types of communications media such as a signal that may be propagated through various physical phenomena e.g. an electromagnetic signal a sound wave signal or an optical signal and in various wired scenarios e.g. via an Ethernet or fiber optic cable and or wireless scenarios e.g. a wireless local area network WLAN such as WiFi a personal area network PAN such as Bluetooth or a cellular or radio network and which encodes a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein.

An exemplary computer readable medium that may be devised in these ways is illustrated in wherein the implementation comprises a computer readable memory device e.g. a CD R DVD R or a platter of a hard disk drive on which is encoded computer readable data . This computer readable data in turn comprises a set of computer instructions that are configured to operate according to the principles set forth herein. In a first such embodiment the processor executable instructions may be configured to cause a device to perform a method of presenting alerts to a user such as the exemplary method of . In a second such embodiment the processor executable instructions may be configured to implement one or more components of a system for presenting alerts to a user such as the exemplary system in the exemplary device of . Many such computer readable media may be devised by those of ordinary skill in the art that are configured to operate in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects and some variations may present additional advantages and or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover some variations may be implemented in combination and some combinations may feature additional advantages and or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments e.g. the exemplary method of the exemplary system of and the exemplary computer readable memory device of to confer individual and or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.

A first aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the scenarios wherein such techniques may be utilized.

As a first variation of this first aspect the techniques presented herein may be utilized in a variety of devices such as laptops tablets phones and other communication devices headsets earpieces eyewear wristwatches portable gaming devices portable media players such as televisions and music players mobile navigation devices mobile appliances and vehicles.

As a second variation of this first aspect the techniques presented herein may be utilized to present alerts having many types of meaning such as the receipt of an incoming call or an incoming message the presence or availability of another individual the receipt of a warning such as a weather traffic or news alert an informational bulletin or update of a software application a cue pertaining to the environment of the user such as a directional message from a navigation device and the completion of a task on the device such as the delivery of a message to another individual.

As a third variation of this first aspect the techniques presented herein may be used with many physical types of alerts and the comparison of a corresponding noise level of the environment with a noise level threshold . As a first example the alert may comprise an audio alert such as a tone music sample voice recording or synthesized voice expression and the noise of the environment may be measured by a microphone as a sound volume e.g. a decibel measurement. As a second example the alert may comprise a vibration and the noise level may be measured by a vibration sensor according to the vibration of the environment e.g. the magnitude of vibration experienced by the user . As a third example the alert may comprise a visual alert such as a light emitting diode or a backlit display of a device and the noise may be measured as the ambient light of the environment e.g. a visual display may be imperceptible due to glare produced by the sun on a bright day . As a fourth example the alert may comprise pressure or force and the noise of the environment may be measured as the pressure or force exerted by the environment on the user e.g. a ring device worn on a finger may present an alert by squeezing the finger of the user but this alert may be imperceptible if the user is currently engaged in physical activity that also exerts force on the hands of the user such as swimming . As a fifth example the alert may comprise a change in temperature applied to the skin of the user and the noise level of the environment may be measured as the temperature of the environment e.g. a ring device may heat up to convey an alert but may be imperceptible if the user s hands are already overly warm . These and other scenarios may be suitable for application of the techniques presented herein.

A second aspect that may vary among embodiments of the techniques presented herein involves the manner of detecting the noise level of the environment for comparison with a noise level threshold .

As a first variation of this second aspect the device may detect the noise level of the environment upon receiving a request to present an alert to the user e.g. only while an alert memory stores at least one stored alert . This variation may be advantageous e.g. by conserving the battery power and computational resources of the device .

As a second variation of this second aspect the device may periodically detect the noise level of the environment of the user and may periodically compare the last detected noise level of the environment with the noise level threshold . This variation may be advantageous e.g. by having completed the noise level determination upon receiving the alert enabling a more rapid response to the determination e.g. the device does not have to wait to sample the noise level of the environment before determining the handling of the alert . Additionally sampling the noise level periodically may provide a more accurate determination e.g. based on the mean noise level of the environment over a period of time such as ten seconds rather than a comparatively instantaneous comparison that may not be as accurate.

As a further variation of this second aspect the device may detect the noise level periodically in a different manner whether the environment is currently detected to be noisy or quiet. For example while the noise level is below the noise level threshold the device may detect the noise level at a first period duration and while the noise level is above the noise level threshold the device may detect the noise level at a second period duration that is shorter than the first period duration. This variation may be selected e.g. because determining that the device has transitioned from a noisy environment into a quiet environment such that deferred alerts may now be presented to the user may represent a more significant determination than detecting than determining that the device has transitioned from a quiet environment into a noisy environment wherein new alerts are simply to be deferred. Additionally the period of each detection may be further adjusted based on other factors e.g. if respective alerts comprise an alert priority then the period of duration of the second detection period i.e. detecting when the device has transitioned from a noisy environment to a quiet environment may be adjusted in view of the alert priorities of stored alerts in an alert memory e.g. a short period duration may be selected if a high priority alert is stored and a longer period duration may be selected if only lower priority alerts are stored .

As a third variation of this second aspect the noise level threshold may be selected by the user e.g. as a noise sensitivity slider that allows the user to specify the sensitivity of the device to noise in relation to deferring received alerts . Alternatively or additionally the noise level threshold may be automatically determined for the user by observing when the user is consistently able to perceive an alert and when the user is consistently unable to perceive an alert . For example an exemplary system may include an alert response monitor that detects a user response of the user to an alert presented in the environment and adjusts the noise level threshold of the device according to the user response of the user to the alert . As one such scenario the frequency spectrum may comprise a vibration frequency spectrum and the alert may comprises a vibration alert to be presented to the user within a vibration frequency range. The device may identify a noise level of the environment within the vibration frequency range of the alert and compare the noise level with the noise level threshold in order to determine whether to present or defer the vibration alert .

A third aspect that may vary among embodiments of the techniques presented herein involves the response of the device to the determination that the noise level of the environment exceeds the noise level threshold .

As a first variation of this third aspect upon determining that the noise level is above the noise level threshold and in addition to deferring the presentation of the alert to a later time when the noise level subsides the device may present to the user a notification of the alert in another modality. For example the device may present a message on a display of the device indicating that an alert has been received during a noisy period and has been deferred and stored for later presentation to the user .

As a second variation of this third aspect upon determining that a first alert is imperceptible to the user in view of the noise level of the environment a device may identify an alternative noise level of the environment within the alternative frequency range of an alternative alert that is presentable to the user at an alternative frequency range of the frequency spectrum that is different from the frequency spectrum of the first alert . The device may then compare the alternative noise level with the noise level threshold and upon determining that the alternative noise level is below the noise level threshold present the alternative alert to the user instead of the first alert .

As a further example of this third variation of this second aspect upon identifying identified a multitude of alerts for which the frequency range was below the noise level threshold the device may present a combination of such alerts e.g. a combination of tones that are individually perceptible over the noise level in the respective frequency ranges and that are even more readily perceptible when presented together either concurrently or consecutively .

As a third variation of this fourth aspect the device may present an alternative alert in a different sensory modality e.g. instead of presenting an audio alert when the sound noise level of the environment is high present a vibrational alert . For example if the default alert is provided in a first sensory modality the device may present an alternative alert in a second sensory modality that is different from the first sensory modality.

As a fourth variation of this third aspect after deferring the presentation of an alert the device may store the alert in an alert log and may later present the alert log to the user . The alert log may comprise e.g. simply an indication that one or more alerts have been received e.g. while in a noisy area you missed three calls a description of each alert such as the names of contacts initiating one or more missed calls and or a summary of the content of each alert such as a recording or text transcript of voicemail messages left by each contact who initiated a missed call .

As a fifth variation of this third aspect the device may attempt to present the alert to the user despite the noise level of the environment . For example if the user happens to be looking at the device the user may notice a visual indicator of the communication request even if the user is unable to hear an audio alert. Accordingly the device may both present the alert at the time of the communication request and also defer the alert if missed for a subsequent time when the device detects that the noise level is below the noise level threshold. Moreover the device may determine whether or not to present the alert now based on the activity of the user e.g. if the user is currently interacting with the device then the device may present the alert now despite the noise level of the environment and if the user is not currently interacting with the device the device may defer the alert until the noise level is reduced. Many such variations in the response of a device to the deferral of an alert may be included in embodiments of the techniques presented herein.

A fourth variation of the techniques presented herein involves the communication of the device with a contact whose request for a communication session with the user is the source of an alarm . Where an alert is associated with a contact such as an individual initiating a communication request to initiate a communication session with the user the device may interact with the contact in various ways upon deferring the alert to the user.

As a first variation of this fourth aspect the device may decline the communication request and may do so promptly upon determining the deferral of the alert rather than after an extended delay while attempting to present the alert to the user .

As a second variation of this fourth aspect the device may accept a message from the contact such as a voicemail or text message and may associate the message with the alert for presentation to the user in an alert log .

As a third variation of this fourth aspect the device may provide an automated response that notifies the contact that the user is unavailable to accept the communication request due to the noise level of the environment of the user thereby informing the contact of the cause of the user s unavailability. In some embodiments the automated response may be adjusted according to the contact e.g. a first set of contacts may receive a first automated response containing information about the noisy environment while a second set of contacts may receive a different automated response that only informs the contact of the user s intent to return the communication request at a later time .

As a fourth variation of this fourth aspect the device may inform the contact that when the noise level of the environment diminishes below the noise level threshold the device shall present the alert to the user and or may notify the contact that the user is now available.

As a fifth variation of this fourth aspect the device may present different messages to different contacts e.g. close contacts such as family members and friends of the user may be notified that the user is in a noisy environment while more distant contacts and unknown contacts may be provided with a message that the user is simply unavailable. Accordingly the device may upon receiving from the user at least two messages respectively deliverable to a contact when the user is unavailable to accept the communication request store the messages respectively associated with a contact and upon receiving a request from a contact to establish a communication session present to the contact the message that is associated with the contact when the user is unavailable to accept the communication request.

As a sixth variation of this fourth aspect the device may limit the number of notifications sent to a particular contact . For example if a contact repeatedly attempts to contact the user the device may limit the presentation of messages informing the contact of the status of the user to a notification frequency threshold e.g. a maximum of three messages per ten minute block of time and may refrain from notifying the contact upon receiving further requests. Many such variations may be utilized in the communication of the device with contacts regarding the deferral of alerts to the user in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects and some variations may present additional advantages and or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover some variations may be implemented in combination and some combinations may feature additional advantages and or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments to confer individual and or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.
