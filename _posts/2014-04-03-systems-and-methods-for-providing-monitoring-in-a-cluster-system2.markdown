A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the file or records of the Patent and Trademark Office but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

The present application generally relates to data communication networks. In particular the present application relates to systems and methods for monitor distribution in a cluster of multi core devices.

Monitoring in a distributed environment may include a number of nodes monitoring services and virtual servers that they control. If each node in the cluster monitors each service independently that can increase the number of probes and the load on the servers. As networks expand in size and capacity the number of nodes monitoring is expected to increase substantially. The significant increase in processing requirements may overburden a server.

The present application is directed towards systems and methods for providing monitoring in a cluster architecture also referred to herein as a cluster system . The systems and methods distribute the monitors for a service and the ownership of a service across a cluster system comprising a plurality of nodes. The nodes in the cluster can be configured to have different sets of virtual servers sometimes referred to as vservers and services. The ownership and monitoring of the services can be distributed among all the nodes in the cluster.

In some embodiments nodes in a cluster can be configured to have a different set of vservers and services. If each node in the cluster monitors each service independently in some embodiments that can increase the number of probes and the load on the servers. In one aspect the present disclosure is directed to distribution of the monitoring ownership of each vserver and or service among the nodes sometimes referred to as multi core or multi node distributed monitoring.

In some embodiments of distributed monitoring the monitor binding ownership is distributed among a plurality of processing engines. The monitor binding ownership may be determined for example for TCP monitors by a hash value of a monitor and service name to determine the owner of the monitor binding. In still other embodiments non TCP monitors may determine the owner based on a receive side scaler RSS hash decision. For example an RSS algorithm may hash source and or destination addresses and or ports to select a packet engine to steer the packet to and such packet engine may be chosen as the owner responsible for monitoring the associated flow application service or vserver. In further embodiments such as internet protocol version 6 sometimes referred to as IPv6 the packet engine is chosen as the owner because in some implementations of IPv6 the packets may be steered to a first packet engine PE or packet engine zero PE0 .

In some embodiments a monitoring master such as PE0 is responsible for computing the service state. In still other embodiments each node may probe its set of monitors and inform the monitoring master PE of the probe status. The monitoring master may collect this information from all PEs in order to compute the service state and push this information to all the other PEs.

In some embodiments inline monitoring may done by all PEs. In still other embodiments explicit probing is done by the monitoring master. In further embodiments there are many monitors which depend on aggregated values least response time method LRTM load based traffic based which may require special handling. In various embodiments including domain based services DBS there may be two bindings. The first binding may be to a primary server information and the second one to secondary server information. In some embodiments the ownership of the two bindings is given to the same PE. In many embodiments whenever there is an IP change the owner PE informs all the other PEs of the change. In some embodiments level 2 or layer 2 data link layer information obtained from the monitors such as MAC addresses VLAN information or channel may be sent to all the PEs by the owner PE.

In another aspect the distributed monitoring concept may be extended to clusters. In some embodiments monitoring ownership can be divided among all the nodes in a cluster system. In a cluster environment the distribution may be done at a service level rather than at a monitor binding level. In some embodiments cluster monitoring will produce a design that may be simple and can help to reduce the number of probe status updates from different nodes to the monitoring master. In still other embodiments the distribution may be done using a probalistic record linkage PRL module wherein the PRL is based on a consistent hashing algorithm.

In some embodiments the node level distribution of the monitors may occur whenever the node view state changes. For example and without limitation the node level distribution may occur when a node joins or leave the cluster system. In response to the view state change the distribution of the monitors may be updated.

In some embodiments a service unique ID hash will be used to determine the monitoring owner of a service using probalistic record linkage PRL . In still other embodiments the unique ID may be provided by a configuration module as part of an entity addition command. In further embodiments within the node the monitor bindings may be distributed among the PEs.

In some embodiments each node will monitor a set of owned services. Whenever the service state changes a monitoring master packet engine such as PE0 may update all other PEs within the owner node. In still other embodiments the monitoring master PE0 may also send service state updates to all other non owner nodes in the cluster system. In various embodiments the monitoring owner node may keep retransmitting the service update until all the other nodes have successfully verified that they have received the service update message. In many embodiments a node to node messaging sometimes referred to as NNM interface or protocol will be used to transmit the service state update messages inside the cluster system.

In some embodiments the service state update includes at least one of a current state of the service layer two information a maximum segment size an IP address and a time to live TTL value. In further embodiments the method may include receiving by a non owning node the service state message and updating the service state. In various embodiments the method includes the master node updating all the packet engines executing on it via core to core messaging sometimes referred to as CCM .

In some embodiments all the service like entities may be using the same infrastructure service state synchronization SSS to update the service state and other meta data in the cluster. In still other embodiments the list of entities which are going to use the SSS update infrastructure includes services service group members and DBS services.

For exemplary purposes one embodiment of a two node cluster may include a first two nodes referred to as b0 and b1 two services S1 and S2 and a plurality of monitors m1 m2 m3 and m4. The monitors m1 and m2 may be bound to service s1 and monitors m3 and m4 may be bound to service s2. A hash of information about service s1 such as addressing information or service name may yield b0 and similarly a hash of service s2 information may yield b1. Within node b0 the monitors m1 and m2 may be distributed among the PEs running on b0. Similarly within b1 m3 and m4 may be distributed among the PEs running on b1. Whenever s1 s state changes b0 may transmit an update to b1 and similarly whenever s2 s state changes b1 may transmit the update to b0.

In another aspect it may be required to monitor the path from each node to the service. This feature of probing the service from all the cluster nodes to check individual reachability may be referred to as path monitoring. In some embodiments path monitoring may allow all the nodes in a cluster system to probe a service that they do not own. Each node can then determine the reachability of a service that it is not under its control. In some embodiments options for path monitoring may be enabled or disabled via add and set commands for each service and service group providing granular control over path monitoring.

In one embodiment the present solution is directed to a method for distributing monitoring of one or more services across a plurality of nodes in a cluster system using path monitoring. The method may include identifying by an administrator in a cluster system a service in the cluster system. The method may also include identifying by the administrator a master node based upon a hash value associated with the node. The method may further include identifying by the administrator a path monitoring state for a service. The method further includes transmitting by the master node a service state update of the service to the other nodes in the cluster system.

In some embodiments by default the pathMonitor option will be disabled for all the service and service groups. In still other embodiments when an admin enables the validate path option for any given service each node which owns the service may start probing the service using internet control messaging protocol sometimes referred to as ICMP ping probes . In further embodiments the state of the service at any given node may be derived by considering both the service state advertised by the monitoring owner and the path monitoring state .

In some embodiments the individual nodes may have different service state based on the service reachability from the node. In still other embodiments an administrator might want to bring down the service on each and every node of the cluster if even one node is not able to reach the service.

For example a two node cluster including nodes b0 and b1 two services s1 and s2 monitors m1 m2 m3 and m4 may also include path monitors p1 and p2. Monitors m1 and m2 may be bound to S1 and monitors m3 and m4 bound to S2 as discussed above. P1 and P2 may act as path monitors for S1 and S2 respectively. In some embodiments the path monitor is not bounded to the session initiation protocol sometimes referred to as sip created for S1 and S2 and being used by the monitors to monitor S1 and S2. Instead a separate sip session may be created for any given service whenever the path monitor option is enabled.

In one embodiment a hash of the S1 service identification may yield b0 and a hash of the S2 service may yield b1. In some embodiments active monitor bindings on each node may include 

Each node may update other nodes in the cluster about any service state change whenever a state of a service monitored by said node changes. In some embodiments the path monitors will be enabled on each and every node of the cluster for all the services. Path monitors on each node may send reachability status information to the monitoring owner of a service such as reachable up or unreachable down .

In some embodiments for example DBS services there may be two bindings wherein one binding serves as primary server information and the other serves as secondary server information. The ownership of the two bindings may be given to the same node as the ownership of the service. In some embodiments whenever there is an IP address change the owner node may send an update to the other nodes in the cluster as part of SSS service state update. The recipient node may update the IP address and the service state accordingly.

In one aspect the present disclosure is directed to a method for monitor distribution in cluster systems. The method includes determining by each node in a cluster of nodes a service of a plurality of services to be monitored by that node for the cluster based on a hash of an identity of the service in a configuration for the cluster. The method further includes establishing by each node responsive to the determination a monitor for each service to be monitored by that node for the cluster. The method further includes identifying by a first monitor on a first node in the cluster of the nodes a status of a service being monitored by the cluster. The method further includes transmitting by the first monitor on the first node to each node in the cluster a message comprising the status of the service.

In some embodiments the method includes establishing by each node in the cluster a master monitor among a plurality of monitors established on the corresponding node. The method further includes updating by the master monitor the other monitors of the node with the status of the service. In an embodiment the method includes identifying by each node ownership of a service to monitor in the cluster based on the hash of the identity of the service. The hash of the identity of the service may include a name of the service configured in the configuration for the cluster. In some embodiments the method includes redistributing ownership of services in the cluster in response to a configuration event in the cluster that changes a topology of the cluster. In an embodiment the method includes generating by the monitor a service state update for the service in response to a configuration event in the cluster. The method further includes re transmitting by the monitor an acknowledgement message to each node in the cluster until each node acknowledges receipt of the service state update. The method further includes comparing by the master monitor a service identity in a server database to a unique identity in the service state update to confirm the monitor is a current monitor for the service.

In some embodiments the method includes enabling by the monitor a path monitoring option for the service. The path monitoring option may enable each node in the cluster to probe the service to determine a service reachability from each node in the cluster to the service. The method further includes transmitting by each node in the cluster a path monitoring state update to the monitor for the service. The path monitoring state update may include the service reachability for each node in the cluster to the service.

In another aspect the present disclosure is directed to a system for monitor distribution in cluster systems. The system may include a cluster of nodes. Each node in the cluster can be configured to determine a service of a plurality of services to be monitored by that node for the cluster based on a hash of an identity of the service in a configuration for the cluster. Responsive to the determination each node can establish a monitor for each service to be monitored by that node for the cluster. The system further includes a first monitor configured on a first node in the cluster. The first node may be configured to determine a status of the service being monitored by the cluster and transmit to each node in the cluster a message including the status of the service.

In some embodiments each node can be configured to establish a master monitor among a plurality of monitors established on the corresponding node. The master monitor can be configured to update the other monitors of the node with the status of the service. In an embodiment each node can be configured to identify ownership of a service to monitor in the cluster based on the hash value of the identity of the service including a name of the service configured in the configuration for the cluster. In some embodiment each node can be configured to redistribute ownership of services in the cluster in response to a configuration event in the cluster that changes a topology of the cluster. In an embodiment the monitor can be configured to generate a service state update for the service in response to a configuration event in the cluster. The monitor can be configured to transmit an acknowledgement message to each node in the cluster until each node acknowledges receipt of the service state update.

In some embodiments the master monitor can be configured to compare a service identity in a server database to a unique identity in the service state update to confirm the monitor is a current monitor for the service. In an embodiment the monitor can be configured to enable a path monitoring option for the service. The path monitoring option may enable each node in the cluster to probe the service to determine a service reachability from each node in the cluster to the service. In some embodiments each node in the cluster can be configured to transmit a path monitoring state update to the monitor for the service. The path monitoring state update including the service reachability for each node in the cluster to the service.

In accordance with Moore s Law the number of transistors that may be placed on an integrated circuit may double approximately every two years. However CPU speed increases may reach plateaus for example CPU speed has been around 3.5 4 GHz range since 2005. In some cases CPU manufacturers may not rely on CPU speed increases to gain additional performance. Some CPU manufacturers may add additional cores to their processors to provide additional performance. Products such as those of software and networking vendors that rely on CPUs for performance gains may improve their performance by leveraging these multi core CPUs. The software designed and constructed for a single CPU may be redesigned and or rewritten to take advantage of a multi threaded parallel architecture or otherwise a multi core architecture.

A multi core architecture of the appliance referred to as nCore or multi core technology allows the appliance in some embodiments to break the single core performance barrier and to leverage the power of multi core CPUs. In the previous architecture described in connection with a single network or packet engine is run. The multiple cores of the nCore technology and architecture allow multiple packet engines to run concurrently and or in parallel. With a packet engine running on each core the appliance architecture leverages the processing capacity of additional cores. In some embodiments this provides up to a 7 increase in performance and scalability.

Illustrated in are some embodiments of work task load or network traffic distribution across one or more processor cores according to a type of parallelism or parallel computing scheme such as functional parallelism data parallelism or flow based data parallelism. In brief overview illustrates embodiments of a multi core system such as an appliance with n cores a total of cores numbers 1 through N. In one embodiment work load or network traffic can be distributed among a first core A a second core B a third core C a fourth core D a fifth core E a sixth core F a seventh core G and so on such that distribution is across all or two or more of the n cores N hereinafter referred to collectively as cores . There may be multiple VIPs each running on a respective core of the plurality of cores. There may be multiple packet engines each running on a respective core of the plurality of cores. Any of the approaches used may lead to different varying or similar work load or performance level across any of the cores. For a functional parallelism approach each core may run a different function of the functionalities provided by the packet engine a VIP or appliance . In a data parallelism approach data may be paralleled or distributed across the cores based on the Network Interface Card NIC or VIP receiving the data. In another data parallelism approach processing may be distributed across the cores by distributing data flows to each core.

In further detail to in some embodiments load work or network traffic can be distributed among cores according to functional parallelism . Functional parallelism may be based on each core performing one or more respective functions. In some embodiments a first core may perform a first function while a second core performs a second function. In functional parallelism approach the functions to be performed by the multi core system are divided and distributed to each core according to functionality. In some embodiments functional parallelism may be referred to as task parallelism and may be achieved when each processor or core executes a different process or function on the same or different data. The core or processor may execute the same or different code. In some cases different execution threads or code may communicate with one another as they work. Communication may take place to pass data from one thread to the next as part of a workflow.

In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to functional parallelism can comprise distributing network traffic according to a particular function such as network input output management NW I O A secure sockets layer SSL encryption and decryption B and transmission control protocol TCP functions C. This may lead to a work performance or computing load based on a volume or level of functionality being used. In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to data parallelism can comprise distributing an amount of work based on distributing data associated with a particular hardware or software component. In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to flow based data parallelism can comprise distributing data based on a context or flow such that the amount of work A N on each core may be similar substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed.

In the case of the functional parallelism approach each core may be configured to run one or more functionalities of the plurality of functionalities provided by the packet engine or VIP of the appliance. For example core 1 may perform network I O processing for the appliance while core 2 performs TCP connection management for the appliance. Likewise core 3 may perform SSL offloading while core 4 may perform layer 7 or application layer processing and traffic management. Each of the cores may perform the same function or different functions. Each of the cores may perform more than one function. Any of the cores may run any of the functionality or portions thereof identified and or described in conjunction with . In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of performance or load .

For example core 1 may perform network I O processing for the appliance while core 2 performs TCP connection management for the appliance. Likewise core 3 may perform SSL offloading while core 4 may perform layer 7 or application layer processing and traffic management. Each of the cores may perform the same function or different functions. Each of the cores may perform more than one function. Any of the cores may run any of the functionality or portions thereof identified and or described in conjunction with . In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of load or performance.

The functionality or tasks may be distributed in any arrangement and scheme. For example illustrates a first core Core 1 A processing applications and processes associated with network I O functionality A. Network traffic associated with network I O in some embodiments can be associated with a particular port number. Thus outgoing and incoming packets having a port destination associated with NW I O A will be directed towards Core 1 A which is dedicated to handling all network traffic associated with the NW I O port. Similarly Core 2 B is dedicated to handling functionality associated with SSL processing and Core 4 D may be dedicated handling all TCP level processing and functionality.

While illustrates functions such as network I O SSL and TCP other functions can be assigned to cores. These other functions can include any one or more of the functions or operations described herein. For example any of the functions described in conjunction with may be distributed across the cores on a functionality basis. In some cases a first VIP A may run on a first core while a second VIP B with a different configuration may run on a second core. In some embodiments each core can handle a particular functionality such that each core can handle the processing associated with that particular function. For example Core 2 B may handle SSL offloading while Core 4 D may handle application layer processing and traffic management.

In other embodiments work load or network traffic may be distributed among cores according to any type and form of data parallelism . In some embodiments data parallelism may be achieved in a multi core system by each core performing the same task or functionally on different pieces of distributed data. In some embodiments a single execution thread or code controls operations on all pieces of data. In other embodiments different threads or instructions control the operation but may execute the same code. In some embodiments data parallelism is achieved from the perspective of a packet engine vServers VIPs A C network interface cards NIC D E and or any other networking hardware or software included on or associated with an appliance . For example each core may run the same packet engine or VIP code or configuration but operate on different sets of distributed data. Each networking hardware or software construct can receive different varying or substantially the same amount of data and as a result may have varying different or relatively the same amount of load .

In the case of a data parallelism approach the work may be divided up and distributed based on VIPs NICs and or data flows of the VIPs or NICs. In one of these approaches the work of the multi core system may be divided or distributed among the VIPs by having each VIP work on a distributed set of data. For example each core may be configured to run one or more VIPs. Network traffic may be distributed to the core for each VIP handling that traffic. In another of these approaches the work of the appliance may be divided or distributed among the cores based on which NIC receives the network traffic. For example network traffic of a first NIC may be distributed to a first core while network traffic of a second NIC may be distributed to a second core. In some cases a core may process data from multiple NICs.

While illustrates a single vServer associated with a single core as is the case for VIP1 A VIP2 B and VIP3 C. In some embodiments a single vServer can be associated with one or more cores . In contrast one or more vServers can be associated with a single core . Associating a vServer with a core may include that core to process all functions associated with that particular vServer. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code and configuration. In other embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code but different configuration. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having different code and the same or different configuration.

Like vServers NICs can also be associated with particular cores . In many embodiments NICs can be connected to one or more cores such that when a NIC receives or transmits data packets a particular core handles the processing involved with receiving and transmitting the data packets. In one embodiment a single NIC can be associated with a single core as is the case with NIC1 D and NIC2 E. In other embodiments one or more NICs can be associated with a single core . In other embodiments a single NIC can be associated with one or more cores . In these embodiments load could be distributed amongst the one or more cores such that each core processes a substantially similar amount of load. A core associated with a NIC may process all functions and or data associated with that particular NIC.

While distributing work across cores based on data of VIPs or NICs may have a level of independency in some embodiments this may lead to unbalanced use of cores as illustrated by the varying loads of .

In some embodiments load work or network traffic can be distributed among cores based on any type and form of data flow. In another of these approaches the work may be divided or distributed among cores based on data flows. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approaches.

In flow based data parallelism distribution of data is related to any type of flow of data such as request response pairings transactions sessions connections or application communications. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. The distribution of data flow may be such that each core carries a substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed amount of load data or network traffic.

In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approached. In one embodiment data flow can be distributed based on a transaction or a series of transactions. This transaction in some embodiments can be between a client and a server and can be characterized by an IP address or other packet identifier. For example Core 1 A can be dedicated to transactions between a particular client and a particular server therefore the load A on Core 1 A may be comprised of the network traffic associated with the transactions between the particular client and server. Allocating the network traffic to Core 1 A can be accomplished by routing all data packets originating from either the particular client or server to Core 1 A.

While work or load can be distributed to the cores based in part on transactions in other embodiments load or work can be allocated on a per packet basis. In these embodiments the appliance can intercept data packets and allocate them to a core having the least amount of load. For example the appliance could allocate a first incoming data packet to Core 1 A because the load A on Core 1 is less than the load B N on the rest of the cores B N. Once the first data packet is allocated to Core 1 A the amount of load A on Core 1 A is increased proportional to the amount of processing resources needed to process the first data packet. When the appliance intercepts a second data packet the appliance will allocate the load to Core 4 D because Core 4 D has the second least amount of load. Allocating data packets to the core with the least amount of load can in some embodiments ensure that the load A N distributed to each core remains substantially equal.

In other embodiments load can be allocated on a per unit basis where a section of network traffic is allocated to a particular core . The above mentioned example illustrates load balancing on a per packet basis. In other embodiments load can be allocated based on a number of packets such that every 10 100 or 1000 packets are allocated to the core having the least amount of load. The number of packets allocated to a core can be a number determined by an application user or administrator and can be any number greater than zero. In still other embodiments load can be allocated based on a time metric such that packets are distributed to a particular core for a predetermined amount of time. In these embodiments packets can be distributed to a particular core for five milliseconds or for any period of time determined by a user program system administrator or otherwise. After the predetermined time period elapses data packets are transmitted to a different core for the predetermined period of time.

Flow based data parallelism methods for distributing work load or network traffic among the one or more cores can comprise any combination of the above mentioned embodiments. These methods can be carried out by any part of the appliance by an application or set of executable instructions executing on one of the cores such as the packet engine or by any application program or agent executing on a computing device in communication with the appliance .

The functional and data parallelism computing schemes illustrated in can be combined in any manner to generate a hybrid parallelism or distributed processing scheme that encompasses function parallelism data parallelism flow based data parallelism or any portions thereof. In some cases the multi core system may use any type and form of load balancing schemes to distribute load among the one or more cores . The load balancing scheme may be used in any combination with any of the functional and data parallelism schemes or combinations thereof.

The packet engine s A N can in some embodiments be associated with a particular server user client or network. When a packet engine becomes associated with a particular entity that packet engine can process data packets associated with that entity. For example should a packet engine be associated with a first user that packet engine will process and operate on packets generated by the first user or packets having a destination address associated with the first user. Similarly the packet engine may choose not to be associated with a particular entity such that the packet engine can process and otherwise operate on any data packets not generated by that entity or destined for that entity.

In some instances the packet engine s A N can be configured to carry out the any of the functional and or data parallelism schemes illustrated in .

Each core A N in one embodiment can be associated with a particular packet engine such that load balancing can be carried out by the packet engine. Load balancing may in this embodiment require that each packet engine A N associated with a core communicate with the other packet engines associated with cores so that the packet engines A N can collectively determine where to distribute load. One embodiment of this process can include an arbiter that receives votes from each packet engine for load. The arbiter can distribute load to each packet engine A N based in part on the age of the engine s vote and in some cases a priority value associated with the current amount of load on an engine s associated core .

A core may have or use memory that is shared or assigned to multiple cores. The memory may be considered public or shared memory that is accessible by more than one core. A core may use any combination of private and public memory. With separate address spaces for each core some level of coordination is eliminated from the case of using the same address space. With a separate address space a core can perform work on information and data in the core s own address space without worrying about conflicts with other cores. Each packet engine may have a separate memory pool for TCP and or SSL connections.

Instead of the functionality of the cores being deployed in the form of a physical processor such functionality may be deployed in a virtualized environment on any computing device such as a client server or appliance . In other embodiments instead of the functionality of the cores being deployed in the form of an appliance or a single device the functionality may be deployed across multiple devices in any arrangement. For example one device may comprise two or more cores and another device may comprise two or more cores. For example a multi core system may include a cluster of computing devices a server farm or network of computing devices. In some embodiments instead of the functionality of the cores being deployed in the form of cores the functionality may be deployed on a plurality of processors such as a plurality of single core processors.

In one embodiment the cores may be any type and form of processor. In some embodiments a core can function substantially similar to any processor or central processing unit described herein.

In embodiments where the system comprises one or more flow distributors each flow distributor can be associated with a processor or a packet engine . The flow distributors can comprise an interface mechanism that allows each flow distributor to communicate with the other flow distributors executing within the system . In one instance the one or more flow distributors can determine how to balance load by communicating with each other. This process can operate substantially similarly to the process described above for submitting votes to an arbiter which then determines which flow distributor should receive the load. In other embodiments a first flow distributor can identify the load on an associated core and determine whether to forward a first data packet to the associated core based on any of the following criteria the load on the associated core is above a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is below a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is less than the load on the other cores or any other metric that can be used to determine where to forward data packets based in part on the amount of load on a processor.

In some embodiments the RSS module uses the MICROSOFT receive side scaling RSS scheme. In one embodiment RSS is a Microsoft Scalable Networking initiative technology that enables receive processing to be balanced across multiple processors in the system while maintaining in order delivery of the data. The RSS may use any type and form of hashing scheme to determine a core or processor for processing a network packet.

The RSS module can apply any type and form hash function such as the Toeplitz hash function. The hash function may be applied to the hash type or any the sequence of values. The hash function may be a secure hash of any security level or is otherwise cryptographically secure. The hash function may use a hash key. The size of the key is dependent upon the hash function. For the Toeplitz hash the size may be 40 bytes for IPv6 and 16 bytes for IPv4.

The hash function may be designed and constructed based on any one or more criteria or design goals. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides an even distribution of hash result for different hash inputs and different hash types including TCP IPv4 TCP IPv6 IPv4 and IPv6 headers. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is evenly distributed when a small number of buckets are present for example two or four . In some embodiments hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is randomly distributed when a large number of buckets were present for example 64 buckets . In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on a level of computational or resource usage. In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on ease or difficulty of implementing the hash in hardware. In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on the ease or difficulty of a malicious remote host to send packets that would all hash to the same bucket.

The RSS may generate hashes from any type and form of input such as a sequence of values. This sequence of values can include any portion of the network packet such as any header field or payload of network packet or portions thereof. In some embodiments the input to the hash may be referred to as a hash type and include any tuples of information associated with a network packet or data flow such as any of the following a four tuple comprising at least two IP addresses and two ports a four tuple comprising any four sets of values a six tuple a two tuple and or any other sequence of numbers or values. The following are example of hash types that may be used by RSS 

4 tuple of source TCP Port source IP version 4 IPv4 address destination TCP Port and destination IPv4 address.

4 tuple of source TCP Port source IP version 6 IPv6 address destination TCP Port and destination IPv6 address.

2 tuple of source IPv6 address and destination IPv6 address including support for parsing IPv6 extension headers.

The hash result or any portion thereof may be used to identify a core or entity such as a packet engine or VIP for distributing a network packet. In some embodiments one or more hash bits or mask are applied to the hash result. The hash bit or mask may be any number of bits or bytes. A NIC may support any number of bits such as seven bits. The network stack may set the actual number of bits to be used during initialization. The number will be between 1 and 7 inclusive.

The hash result may be used to identify the core or entity via any type and form of table such as a bucket table or indirection table. In some embodiments the number of hash result bits are used to index into the table. The range of the hash mask may effectively define the size of the indirection table. Any portion of the hash result or the hast result itself may be used to index the indirection table. The values in the table may identify any of the cores or processor such as by a core or processor identifier. In some embodiments all of the cores of the multi core system are identified in the table. In other embodiments a port of the cores of the multi core system are identified in the table. The indirection table may comprise any number of buckets for example 2 to 128 buckets that may be indexed by a hash mask. Each bucket may comprise a range of index values that identify a core or processor. In some embodiments the flow controller and or RSS module may rebalance the network rebalance the network load by changing the indirection table.

In some embodiments the multi core system does not include a RSS driver or RSS module . In some of these embodiments a software steering module not shown or a software embodiment of the RSS module within the system can operate in conjunction with or as part of the flow distributor to steer packets to cores within the multi core system .

The flow distributor in some embodiments executes within any module or program on the appliance on any one of the cores and on any one of the devices or components included within the multi core system . In some embodiments the flow distributor can execute on the first core A while in other embodiments the flow distributor can execute on the NIC . In still other embodiments an instance of the flow distributor can execute on each core included in the multi core system . In this embodiment each instance of the flow distributor can communicate with other instances of the flow distributor to forward packets back and forth across the cores . There exist situations where a response to a request packet may not be processed by the same core i.e. the first core processes the request while the second core processes the response. In these situations the instances of the flow distributor can intercept the packet and forward it to the desired or correct core i.e. a flow distributor instance can forward the response to the first core. Multiple instances of the flow distributor can execute on any number of cores and any combination of cores .

The flow distributor may operate responsive to any one or more rules or policies. The rules may identify a core or packet processing engine to receive a network packet data or data flow. The rules may identify any type and form of tuple information related to a network packet such as a 4 tuple of source and destination IP address and source and destination ports. Based on a received packet matching the tuple specified by the rule the flow distributor may forward the packet to a core or packet engine. In some embodiments the packet is forwarded to a core via shared memory and or core to core messaging.

Although illustrates the flow distributor as executing within the multi core system in some embodiments the flow distributor can execute on a computing device or appliance remotely located from the multi core system . In such an embodiment the flow distributor can communicate with the multi core system to take in data packets and distribute the packets across the one or more cores . The flow distributor can in one embodiment receive data packets destined for the appliance apply a distribution scheme to the received data packets and distribute the data packets to the one or more cores of the multi core system . In one embodiment the flow distributor can be included in a router or other appliance such that the router can target particular cores by altering meta data associated with each packet so that each packet is targeted towards a sub node of the multi core system . In such an embodiment CISCO s vn tag mechanism can be used to alter or tag each packet with the appropriate meta data.

Illustrated in is an embodiment of a multi core system comprising one or more processing cores A N. In brief overview one of the cores can be designated as a control core A and can be used as a control plane for the other cores . The other cores may be secondary cores which operate in a data plane while the control core provides the control plane. The cores A N may share a global cache . While the control core provides a control plane the other cores in the multi core system form or provide a data plane. These cores perform data processing functionality on network traffic while the control provides initialization configuration and control of the multi core system.

Further referring to and in more detail the cores A N as well as the control core A can be any processor described herein. Furthermore the cores A N and the control core A can be any processor able to function within the system described in . Still further the cores A N and the control core A can be any core or group of cores described herein. The control core may be a different type of core or processor than the other cores. In some embodiments the control may operate a different packet engine or have a packet engine configured differently than the packet engines of the other cores.

Any portion of the memory of each of the cores may be allocated to or used for a global cache that is shared by the cores. In brief overview a predetermined percentage or predetermined amount of each of the memory of each core may be used for the global cache. For example 50 of each memory of each code may be dedicated or allocated to the shared global cache. That is in the illustrated embodiment 2 GB of each core excluding the control plane core or core 1 may be used to form a 28 GB shared global cache. The configuration of the control plane such as via the configuration services may determine the amount of memory used for the shared global cache. In some embodiments each core may provide a different amount of memory for use by the global cache. In other embodiments any one core may not provide any memory or use the global cache. In some embodiments any of the cores may also have a local cache in memory not allocated to the global shared memory. Each of the cores may store any portion of network traffic to the global shared cache. Each of the cores may check the cache for any content to use in a request or response. Any of the cores may obtain content from the global shared cache to use in a data flow request or response.

The global cache can be any type and form of memory or storage element such as any memory or storage element described herein. In some embodiments the cores may have access to a predetermined amount of memory i.e. 32 GB or any other memory amount commensurate with the system . The global cache can be allocated from that predetermined amount of memory while the rest of the available memory can be allocated among the cores . In other embodiments each core can have a predetermined amount of memory. The global cache can comprise an amount of the memory allocated to each core . This memory amount can be measured in bytes or can be measured as a percentage of the memory allocated to each core . Thus the global cache can comprise 1 GB of memory from the memory associated with each core or can comprise 20 percent or one half of the memory associated with each core . In some embodiments only a portion of the cores provide memory to the global cache while in other embodiments the global cache can comprise memory not allocated to the cores .

Each core can use the global cache to store network traffic or cache data. In some embodiments the packet engines of the core use the global cache to cache and use data stored by the plurality of packet engines. For example the cache manager of and cache functionality of may use the global cache to share data for acceleration. For example each of the packet engines may store responses such as HTML data to the global cache. Any of the cache managers operating on a core may access the global cache to server caches responses to client requests.

In some embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store a port allocation table which can be used to determine data flow based in part on ports. In other embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store an address lookup table or any other table or list that can be used by the flow distributor to determine where to direct incoming and outgoing data packets. The cores can in some embodiments read from and write to cache while in other embodiments the cores can only read from or write to cache . The cores may use the global cache to perform core to core communications.

The global cache may be sectioned into individual memory sections where each section can be dedicated to a particular core . In one embodiment the control core A can receive a greater amount of available cache while the other cores can receiving varying amounts or access to the global cache .

In some embodiments the system can comprise a control core A. While illustrates core 1 A as the control core the control core can be any core within the appliance or multi core system. Further while only a single control core is depicted the system can comprise one or more control cores each having a level of control over the system. In some embodiments one or more control cores can each control a particular aspect of the system . For example one core can control deciding which distribution scheme to use while another core can determine the size of the global cache .

The control plane of the multi core system may be the designation and configuration of a core as the dedicated management core or as a master core. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of operation and functionality the plurality of cores in the multi core system. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of allocation and use of memory of the system among the plurality of cores in the multi core system including initialization and configuration of the same. In some embodiments the control plane includes the flow distributor for controlling the assignment of data flows to cores and the distribution of network packets to cores based on data flows. In some embodiments the control plane core runs a packet engine and in other embodiments the control plane core is dedicated to management and control of the other cores of the system.

The control core A can exercise a level of control over the other cores such as determining how much memory should be allocated to each core or determining which core should be assigned to handle a particular function or hardware software entity. The control core A in some embodiments can exercise control over those cores within the control plan . Thus there can exist processors outside of the control plane which are not controlled by the control core A. Determining the boundaries of the control plane can include maintaining by the control core A or agent executing within the system a list of those cores controlled by the control core A. The control core A can control any of the following initialization of a core determining when a core is unavailable re distributing load to other cores when one core fails determining which distribution scheme to implement determining which core should receive network traffic determining how much cache should be allocated to each core determining whether to assign a particular function or element to a particular core determining whether to permit cores to communicate with one another determining the size of the global cache and any other determination of a function configuration or operation of the cores within the system .

As discussed in the previous section to overcome limitations on transistor spacing and CPU speed increases many CPU manufacturers have incorporated multi core CPUs to improve performance beyond that capable of even a single higher speed CPU. Similar or further performance gains may be made by operating a plurality of appliances either single or multi core together as a distributed or clustered appliance. Individual computing devices or appliances may be referred to as nodes of the cluster. A centralized management system may perform load balancing distribution configuration or other tasks to allow the nodes to operate in conjunction as a single computing system. Externally or to other devices including servers and clients in many embodiments the cluster may be viewed as a single virtual appliance or computing device albeit one with performance exceeding that of a typical individual appliance.

Referring now to illustrated is an embodiment of a computing device cluster or appliance cluster . A plurality of appliances or other computing devices sometimes referred to as nodes such as desktop computers servers rackmount servers blade servers or any other type and form of computing device may be joined into a single appliance cluster . Although referred to as an appliance cluster in many embodiments the cluster may operate as an application server network storage server backup service or any other type of computing device without limitation. In many embodiments the appliance cluster may be used to perform many of the functions of appliances WAN optimization devices network acceleration devices or other devices discussed above.

In some embodiments the appliance cluster may comprise a homogenous set of computing devices such as identical appliances blade servers within one or more chassis desktop or rackmount computing devices or other devices. In other embodiments the appliance cluster may comprise a heterogeneous or mixed set of devices including different models of appliances mixed appliances and servers or any other set of computing devices. This may allow for an appliance cluster to be expanded or upgraded over time with new models or devices for example.

In some embodiments each computing device or appliance of an appliance cluster may comprise a multi core appliance as discussed above. In many such embodiments the core management and flow distribution methods discussed above may be utilized by each individual appliance in addition to the node management and distribution methods discussed herein. This may be thought of as a two tier distributed system with one appliance comprising and distributing data to multiple nodes and each node comprising and distributing data for processing to multiple cores. Accordingly in such embodiments the node distribution system need not manage flow distribution to individual cores as that may be taken care of by a master or control core as discussed above.

In many embodiments an appliance cluster may be physically grouped such as a plurality of blade servers in a chassis or plurality of rackmount devices in a single rack but in other embodiments the appliance cluster may be distributed in a plurality of chassis plurality of racks plurality of rooms in a data center plurality of data centers or any other physical arrangement. Accordingly the appliance cluster may be considered a virtual appliance grouped via common configuration management and purpose rather than a physical group.

In some embodiments an appliance cluster may be connected to one or more networks . For example referring briefly back to in some embodiments an appliance may be deployed between a network joined to one or more clients and a network joined to one or more servers . An appliance cluster may be similarly deployed to operate as a single appliance. In many embodiments this may not require any network topology changes external to appliance cluster allowing for ease of installation and scalability from a single appliance scenario. In other embodiments an appliance cluster may be similarly deployed as shown in or discussed above. In still other embodiments an appliance cluster may comprise a plurality of virtual machines or processes executed by one or more servers. For example in one such embodiment a server farm may execute a plurality of virtual machines each virtual machine configured as an appliance and a plurality of the virtual machines acting in concert as an appliance cluster . In yet still other embodiments an appliance cluster may comprise a mix of appliances or virtual machines configured as appliances . In some embodiments appliance cluster may be geographically distributed with the plurality of appliances not co located. For example referring back to in one such embodiment a first appliance may be located at a first site such as a data center and a second appliance may be located at a second site such as a central office or corporate headquarters. In a further embodiment such geographically remote appliances may be joined by a dedicated network such as a T1 or T3 point to point connection a VPN or any other type and form of network. Accordingly although there may be additional communications latency compared to co located appliances there may be advantages in reliability in case of site power failures or communications outages scalability or other benefits. In some embodiments latency issues may be reduced through geographic or network based distribution of data flows. For example although configured as an appliance cluster communications from clients and servers at the corporate headquarters may be directed to the appliance deployed at the site load balancing may be weighted by location or similar steps can be taken to mitigate any latency.

Still referring to an appliance cluster may be connected to a network via a client data plane . In some embodiments client data plane may comprise a communication network such as a network carrying data between clients and appliance cluster . In some embodiments client data plane may comprise a switch hub router or other network devices bridging an external network and the plurality of appliances of the appliance cluster . For example in one such embodiment a router may be connected to an external network and connected to a network interface of each appliance . In some embodiments this router or switch may be referred to as an interface manager and may further be configured to distribute traffic evenly across the nodes in the application cluster . Thus in many embodiments the interface master may comprise a flow distributor external to appliance cluster . In other embodiments the interface master may comprise one of appliances . For example a first appliance may serve as the interface master receiving incoming traffic for the appliance cluster and distributing the traffic across each of appliances . In some embodiments return traffic may similarly flow from each of appliances via the first appliance serving as the interface master. In other embodiments return traffic from each of appliances may be transmitted directly to a network or via an external router switch or other device. In some embodiments appliances of the appliance cluster not serving as an interface master may be referred to as interface slaves.

The interface master may perform load balancing or traffic flow distribution in any of a variety of ways. For example in some embodiments the interface master may comprise a router performing equal cost multi path ECMP routing with next hops configured with appliances or nodes of the cluster. The interface master may use an open shortest path first OSPF In some embodiments the interface master may use a stateless hash based mechanism for traffic distribution such as hashes based on IP address or other packet information tuples as discussed above. Hash keys and or salt may be selected for even distribution across the nodes. In other embodiments the interface master may perform flow distribution via link aggregation LAG protocols or any other type and form of flow distribution load balancing and routing.

In some embodiments the appliance cluster may be connected to a network via a server data plane . Similar to client data plane server data plane may comprise a communication network such as a network carrying data between servers and appliance cluster . In some embodiments server data plane may comprise a switch hub router or other network devices bridging an external network and the plurality of appliances of the appliance cluster . For example in one such embodiment a router may be connected to an external network and connected to a network interface of each appliance . In many embodiments each appliance may comprise multiple network interfaces with a first network interface connected to client data plane and a second network interface connected to server data plane . This may provide additional security and prevent direct interface of client and server networks by having appliance cluster server as an intermediary device. In other embodiments client data plane and server data plane may be merged or combined. For example appliance cluster may be deployed as a non intermediary node on a network with clients and servers . As discussed above in many embodiments an interface master may be deployed on the server data plane for routing and distributing communications from the servers and network to each appliance of the appliance cluster. In many embodiments an interface master for client data plane and an interface master for server data plane may be similarly configured performing ECMP or LAG protocols as discussed above.

In some embodiments each appliance in appliance cluster may be connected via an internal communication network or back plane . Back plane may comprise a communication network for inter node or inter appliance control and configuration messages and for inter node forwarding of traffic. For example in one embodiment in which a first appliance communicates with a client via network and a second appliance communicates with a server via network communications between the client and server may flow from client to first appliance from first appliance to second appliance via back plane and from second appliance to server and vice versa. In other embodiments back plane may carry configuration messages such as interface pause or reset commands policy updates such as filtering or compression policies status messages such as buffer status throughput or error messages or any other type and form of inter node communication. In some embodiments RSS keys or hash keys may be shared by all nodes in the cluster and may be communicated via back plane . For example a first node or master node may select an RSS key such as at startup or boot and may distribute this key for use by other nodes. In some embodiments back plane may comprise a network between network interfaces of each appliance and may comprise a router switch or other network device not illustrated . Thus in some embodiments and as discussed above a router for client data plane may be deployed between appliance cluster and network a router for server data plane may be deployed between appliance cluster and network and a router for back plane may be deployed as part of appliance cluster . Each router may connect to a different network interface of each appliance . In other embodiments one or more planes may be combined or a router or switch may be split into multiple LANs or VLANs to connect to different interfaces of appliances and serve multiple routing functions simultaneously to reduce complexity or eliminate extra devices from the system.

In some embodiments a control plane not illustrated may communicate configuration and control traffic from an administrator or user to the appliance cluster . In some embodiments the control plane may be a fourth physical network while in other embodiments the control plane may comprise a VPN tunnel or communication via one of planes . Thus the control plane may in some embodiments be considered a virtual communication plane. In other embodiments an administrator may provide configuration and control through a separate interface such as a serial communication interface such as RS 232 a USB communication interface or any other type and form of communication. In some embodiments an appliance may comprise an interface for administration such as a front panel with buttons and a display a web server for configuration via network or back plane or any other type and form of interface.

In some embodiments as discussed above appliance cluster may include internal flow distribution. For example this may be done to allow nodes to join leave transparently to external devices. To prevent an external flow distributor from needing to be repeatedly reconfigured on such changes a node or appliance may act as an interface master or distributor for steering network packets to the correct node within the cluster . For example in some embodiments when a node leaves the cluster such as on failure reset or similar cases an external ECMP router may identify the change in nodes and may rehash all flows to redistribute traffic. This may result in dropping and resetting all connections. The same drop and reset may occur when the node rejoins. In some embodiments for reliability two appliances or nodes within appliance cluster may receive communications from external routers via connection mirroring.

In many embodiments flow distribution among nodes of appliance cluster may use any of the methods discussed above for flow distribution among cores of an appliance. For example in one embodiment a master appliance master node or interface master may compute a RSS hash such as a Toeplitz hash on incoming traffic and consult a preference list or distribution table for the hash. In many embodiments the flow distributor may provide the hash to the recipient appliance when forwarding the traffic. This may eliminate the need for the node to recompute the hash for flow distribution to a core. In many such embodiments the RSS key used for calculating hashes for distribution among the appliances may comprise the same key as that used for calculating hashes for distribution among the cores which may be referred to as a global RSS key allowing for reuse of the calculated hash. In some embodiments the hash may be computed with input tuples of transport layer headers including port numbers internet layer headers including IP addresses or any other packet header information. In some embodiments packet body information may be utilized for the hash. For example in one embodiment in which traffic of one protocol is encapsulated within traffic of another protocol such as lossy UDP traffic encapsulated via a lossless TCP header the flow distributor may calculate the hash based on the headers of the encapsulated protocol e.g. UDP headers rather than the encapsulating protocol e.g. TCP headers . Similarly in some embodiments in which packets are encapsulated and encrypted or compressed the flow distributor may calculate the hash based on the headers of the payload packet after decryption or decompression. In still other embodiments nodes may have internal IP addresses such as for configuration or administration purposes. Traffic to these IP addresses need not be hashed and distributed but rather may be forwarded to the node owning the destination address. For example an appliance may have a web server or other server running for configuration or administration purposes at an IP address of 1.2.3.4 and in some embodiments may register this address with the flow distributor as it s internal IP address. In other embodiments the flow distributor may assign internal IP addresses to each node within the appliance cluster . Traffic arriving from external clients or servers such as a workstation used by an administrator directed to the internal IP address of the appliance 1.2.3.4 may be forwarded directly without requiring hashing.

The systems and methods described herein are directed towards monitor distribution in multi core systems. In general overview the systems and methods distribute ownership of monitors for services and ownership of monitoring of services each of which may have one or more associated monitors over a plurality of cores. If a core owns or is responsible for a monitor for a service the core may be responsible for sending probes to the service according to the monitor and receiving the result of each probe. If a core owns or is responsible for monitoring of a service the core may be responsible for tracking the state of the service by processing the results of probes sent to the service by itself or other cores. As a result the workload for monitoring and tracking the state of services may be distributed across the plurality of cores.

Each core in the plurality of cores may be responsible for monitors for services and each core may send probes to the services according to the monitors and receive the results. If a core is not responsible for the service the core may send the results of its probes for the service to the owner core. If a core owns the service and is thus responsible for tracking the state of the service the core may determine the state of the service. The core may determine the state of the service by processing the results of probes for the service. The core may determine the state of the service by processing the results of probes sent by itself probes sent by other cores or both. The owner core may send messages to other cores regarding the state of the service or a change in the state. The owner core responsible for the service may be considered or referred to as the consolidator of the monitoring for the service.

A core may be generally described herein as being an owner of a service or owning monitoring of a service. If a core owns a service the core or the packet processing engine on the core may take responsibility for establishing and or maintaining a state of the service for the multi core system. In another aspect a core that owns a service may be a core or packet processing engine that is designated as the core or the packet processing engine of the plurality of cores and or plurality of packet engines of the multi core system to be responsible for monitoring the service.

Referring now to a block diagram of an appliance using a plurality of monitoring agents on a plurality of cores to monitor a plurality of network services is shown. In brief overview an appliance comprises a plurality of monitoring agents arranged in a table. Each of the plurality of cores may include a copy of the table which is described in fuller detail in . Each of the plurality of monitoring agents is assigned to monitor a service. In one embodiment each of the plurality of monitoring agents may be assigned a weight. Monitoring agents may also be referred to as probes.

Still referring to an appliance comprises a plurality of monitoring agents or monitors. A monitoring agent may comprise any program script daemon or other computing routine that reports a performance or operational characteristic of a network service to the appliance . A monitoring agent may communicate with a network service once or on a predetermined frequency such as every 1 msec or 1 sec. In some embodiments a monitoring agent may use a request reply messaging mechanism or protocol with the server. In other embodiments a monitoring agent may have a custom or proprietary exchange protocol for communicating with the server. In some embodiments a single monitoring agent may monitor a plurality of servers. In other embodiments a plurality of agents may monitor a single server. In still other embodiments a plurality of monitoring agents may each monitor a plurality of servers wherein each of the plurality of servers is monitored by a plurality of monitoring agents.

In the embodiment shown the one or more monitoring agents are associated with one or more network services . In other embodiments the one or more monitoring agents may monitor an appliance vServer network service client or any other network resource. In one embodiment a user specifies a type of network service to associate with the one or more monitoring agents. In another embodiment a user customizes a monitoring agent. In still another embodiment a generic monitoring agent is used. In yet another embodiment the one or more monitoring agents determine the response time of the one or more network services for responding to a request of one of the following types ping transport control protocol tcp tcp extended content verification hypertext transfer protocol http http extended content verification hypertext transfer protocol secure https https extended content verification user datagram protocol domain name service and file transfer protocol.

In some embodiments the one or more monitoring agents are protocol specific agents each agent determining availability for a network service of a particular protocol type. In some embodiments a monitoring agent determines a response time of a server or network service to a TCP request. In one of these embodiments the agent uses a TCP ICMP echo request command to send a datagram to the network service receive a datagram from the network service in response and determine a response time based on the roundtrip time of the datagram. In another of these embodiments the monitoring agent verifies that the response from the network service included expected content and did not contain errors.

In other embodiments a monitoring agent determines availability of a network service to a UDP request. In one of these embodiments the agent uses a UDP echo command to send a datagram to the network service receive a datagram from the network service in response and determine a response time based on the roundtrip time of the datagram. In another of these embodiments the monitoring agent verifies that the response from the network service included expected content and did not contain errors.

In still other embodiments the monitoring agent determines availability of a network service to an FTP request. In one of these embodiments the monitoring agent sends an FTP command such as a get command or a put command to the network service and determines a time needed by the network service to respond to the command. In another of these embodiments the monitoring agent verifies that the response from the network service included expected content such as contents of a file requested by a get command and did not contain errors.

In yet other embodiments the monitoring agent determines availability of a network service to an HTTP request. In one of these embodiments the monitoring agent sends an HTTP command such as a get request for a uniform resource locator URL or a file to the network service and determines a time needed by the network service to respond to the request. In another of these embodiments the monitoring agent verifies that the response from the network service included expected content such as the contents of a web page identified by the URL and did not contain errors.

In further embodiments the monitoring agent determines availability of a network service to a DNS request. In one of these embodiments the monitoring agent sends a DNS request such as a dnsquery or nslookup for a known network address to the server or network service and determines a time needed by the server or network service to respond to the request. In another of these embodiments the monitoring agent verifies that the response from the network service included expected content such as the domain name of a computing device associated with the known network address and did not contain errors.

A monitoring agent may be assigned a weight by a network appliance . A weight may comprise an integer decimal or any other numeric indicator. In some embodiments a user may configure the weight corresponding to a given monitoring agent. In some embodiments all monitoring agents may be assigned equal weight. In other embodiments a plurality of monitoring agents may each be assigned different weights. The weights may be assigned to the monitors based on any criteria indicating relative importance including without limitation importance of the monitored service reliability of the monitoring mechanism and the frequency of monitoring.

In one embodiment a monitoring agent may be assigned a weight based on the relative importance of the service the appliance monitors. For example if most user requests in a given environment were HTTP requests a monitoring agent monitoring HTTP availability of a server might be assigned a weight of 10 while a monitoring agent monitoring FTP availability of a server might be assigned a weight of 3. Or for example if an administrator placed a high priority on UDP applications a monitoring agent monitoring UDP availability of a server may be assigned a weight of 20 while a DNS monitoring agent may be assigned a weight of 5.

In some embodiments an appliance may compute a sum of the weights of the monitoring agents currently reporting a network service as operational. For example if five monitoring agents each assigned a weight of 30 are monitoring a network service and three of the five monitoring agents report the network service as available the appliance may determine the sum of the monitoring agents currently reporting the network service as operational to be 90. Or for example if only two monitoring agents one with a weight of 20 and the other with a weight of 40 are reporting a server as available the appliance may compute the sum of the monitoring agents currently reporting a server as operational to be 60.

Referring now to a block diagram of an embodiment of a table used for monitoring services in a multi core system is depicted. The table may be store on or in communication with a packet processing engine . Each packet processing engine may be associated with a table . The entries of the tables associated with the packet processing engines may include copies of information regarding the monitors.

In brief overview the table may include entries corresponding to monitors for services. Each entry may correspond to a monitor. Each entry in the table may include fields of information associated with the monitor. The fields of information may include the service name the monitor name the activity status of the monitor with respect to the core and the next time the monitor is scheduled to send a probe to the service also referred to herein as the probe time . In some embodiments the fields of information may include the identity of the core that owns the service being monitored. In some embodiments the fields of information may include the identity of the core that owns the monitor. In many embodiments the fields of information may include the weight assigned to the monitor.

In various embodiments a packet processing engine may create an entry in the table when the packet processing engine receives an instruction from the multi core device to create a monitor for a service. In some embodiments the multi core device may send the instruction to create a monitor to the packet processing engine that will own the monitor. In other embodiments the multi core device may send the instruction to create the monitor to all the packet processing engines . In some of these embodiments each packet processing engine may create an entry for the monitor in its respective tables according to the instruction. In other of these embodiments a packet processing engine may disregard the instruction to create a monitor if the packet processing engine will not own the monitor.

The packet processing engine may process the instruction to create the entry in the table . In some embodiments the packet processing engine may process the instruction via parsing. In some embodiments the packet processing engine may parse the instruction into the service name the monitor name and the information for the monitoring schedule. In other embodiments the packet processing engine may parse the instruction into the service name the number of monitors for the service and information for the monitoring schedules. In many embodiments the packet processing engine may create a new entry in the table and store the service name and the monitor name. In additional embodiments the packet processing engine may create multiple entries according to the number of monitors for the service according to the instruction. In these embodiments the packet processing engine may store for each entry the service name and a monitor name chosen according to a predetermined method. In many embodiments the packet processing engine may store for each entry the information for the monitoring schedule. In additional embodiments the packet processing engine may store for any entry any information obtained by further parsing of the instruction.

The packet processing engine may access the information for the monitoring schedule stored for an entry to calculate a next probe time for a monitor. The packet processing engine may then store the next probe time for the monitor. In many embodiments the information for the monitoring schedule may include a frequency of monitoring. In various embodiments the information for the monitoring schedule may include a formula to calculate the next probe time. In some embodiments upon sending a probe to a service the packet processing engine may calculate the next probe time and overwrite the obsolete probe time for the entry. In other embodiments the packet processing engine may delete the entry and create a new entry for the monitor with the next probe time.

The packet processing engine may determine the owner of the monitor according to a predetermined algorithm as described in further detail below. The packet processing engine may configure the activity status of the monitor with respect to the core according to the determination. If the packet processing engine determines the core owns the monitor the activity status of the monitor may be set to schedulable. As a result the packet processing engine schedules probes for the service according to the monitor s activity status. If the packet processing engine determines the core does not own the monitor the activity status of the monitor may be set to non schedulable. As a result the packet processing engine does not schedule probes for the service according to the monitor s activity status.

Referring now to a flow diagram depicting an embodiment of steps of a method for configuring a table used for monitoring services in a multi core system is shown and described. In brief overview the method includes establishing step a configuration for monitors. The configuration may identify a plurality of monitors to monitor one or more services managed by a plurality of packet processing engines operating on each of the plurality of cores. The method further includes identifying step for each of the plurality of packet processing engines from the configuration a monitor name and service name for each monitor of the plurality of monitors. The method further includes computing step by each of the plurality of packet processing engines for each monitor of the plurality of monitors a value based on a function of the monitor name and the service name. The method further includes determining step by each of the plurality of packet processing engines a packet processing engine from the plurality of packet processing engines to establish the monitor for the service based on the value corresponding to an identifier of the packet processing engine. Although the steps are described with respect to one packet processing engine operating on one core methods for configuring tables by each of the packet processing engines would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.

In further detail at step the packet processing engine may establish the configuration for monitors by allocating memory and creating a table for the monitors. The packet processing engine may create entries for the table in response to instructions from the multi core device to create monitors for services. The packet processing engine may process the instructions to obtain the fields for the entries. For example the packet processing engine may parse an instruction to obtain the service name and the monitor name.

The multi core system may use any type and form of monitor configuration to establish one or more monitors. The configuration may be established via a set of one or more commands or instructions such as a set of commands received via the graphical user interface GUI or the command line interface CLI as described in . In some embodiments the packet processing engine may parse an instruction of a configuration to determine a type of monitor. In some embodiments the packet processing engine may parse an instruction to determine a type of monitor. For example the packet processing engine may determine that the monitor probes the state of a service a least response time of a service a dynamic response time of the service or any other characteristic of the service. In additional embodiments the packet processing engine may parse the instruction to obtain the weight of the monitor. The packet processing engine may parse an instruction to obtain information for a monitoring schedule. The packet processing engine may use the information for the monitoring schedule to calculate the next probe time. In any of these embodiments the packet processing engine may store in an entry any of the information obtained by parsing an instruction to create monitor or any information derived from the parsing.

The packet processing engine may establish the entries of the table in any order. In some embodiments the packet processing engine establishes entries in the order that the packet processing engine receives instructions to create the monitors. In other embodiments the packet processing engine establishes entries in order of the service and monitor names. In further embodiments the packet processing engine establishes entries in order of the probe times. In some embodiments the packet processing engine establishes entries according to ownership of the monitors. For example the packet processing engine may group monitors the packet processing engine owns apart from the monitors that belong to other cores.

At step the packet processing engine may identify configuration information for each monitor. In some embodiments the packet processing engine may identify a monitor name and a service name for each monitor from fields in the entry for each monitor. The packet processing engine may load copies of the monitor and service names into a buffer for additional processing. The packet processing engine may identify other configuration information for each monitor as identified in table . In various embodiments the packet processing engine may identify the type of monitor the weight of the monitor the identity of the core that owns the monitor the identity of the core that owns the service associated with the monitor or any other configuration information.

At step for each monitor the packet processing engine may compute a value based on any configuration information for a monitor. In some embodiments the packet processing engine may compute a value using a function of the monitor name and service name. In various embodiments the monitor name may be an identifier of a monitor. In many embodiments the service name may be an identifier of a service. In numerous embodiments the packet processing engine may compute a value based on a function of any configuration information such as the monitor name service name type of monitor weight of the monitor identity of the core that owns the monitor identity of the core that owns the service associated with the monitor or any combination thereof. The function or the result of the function may be used to identify the owner of the monitor. The result may be used as a lookup or index into a table that identifies cores. The function may be a hash function that identified an index into an indirection table to select the core. As a result the value may correspond to an identifier of a packet processing engine. The packet processing engine may compute the value using any function that results in a desired distribution of monitor ownership among the packet processing engines . The packet processing engine may compute the value using copies of the monitor name service name or any other configuration information loaded into a buffer.

In some embodiments the packet processing engine computes the value according to the sums of the ASCII values of the monitor and service names. In these embodiments the packet processing engine may add the sum of ASCII values of the monitor name to the sum of ASCII values of the service name. In one of these embodiments the packet processing engine may divide this sum by the number of packet processing engines. In another of these embodiments the packet processing engine may perform a modulo operation upon the sum according to the number of packet processing engines. In further embodiments the packet processing engine may create a variable that stores the number of monitors that have been created. In these embodiments the packet processing engine may add the sum of the ASCII values of the service name to the number of created monitors. The packet processing engine may then divide the sum by the number of packet processing engines or perform a modulo operation according to the number of packet processing engines. After the packet processing engine computes the value the packet processing engine may increment the variable to account for the newly created monitor.

The packet processing engine may determine the packet processing engine to establish the monitor for the service based on the computed value. In some embodiments the packet processing engine may compare the computed value to a value assigned to the packet processing engine upon boot up wherein the value indicates the packet processing engine s order among the plurality of packet processing engines. In other embodiments the packet processing engine may compare the computed value to an identifier of the packet processing engine . If the comparison indicates the packet processing engine owns the monitor the packet processing engine sets the activity status of the monitor to schedulable. As a result the packet processing engine will schedule probes for the service according to the monitor. If the comparison indicates that the packet processing engine does not own the monitor the packet processing engine sets the activity status of the monitor to non schedulable. As a result the packet processing engine does not schedule probes for the service although the information for the monitor will remain in the table .

Referring now to a flow diagram depicting steps of an embodiment of a method for monitoring services in a multi core system is shown and described. In brief overview the method includes sending probes to monitor services according to iterations through the entries of the table . For one iteration through the table the method includes initializing variables step associated with the services. The method further includes initializing step a list of services with significant probe results. The method further includes sending step a probe to a service according to the ownership of a monitor and the probe time. The method further includes receiving and processing step the result of the probe. The method further includes determining step if probes have been sent for all the entries in the table . The method further includes sending step information regarding the results of the probes to services owned by other packet processing engines.

For each iteration through the table the packet processing engine may initialize variables associated with the services. A variable may be related to the results of probes for a service. A variable may indicate a change in state for a service. The packet processing engine may create and initialize the variables when the multi core device boots up. In this embodiment the packet processing engine may initialize the variables at the beginning of each iteration through the table . In other embodiments the packet processing engine may initialize the variables at the end of each iteration through the table .

The packet processing engine may send a probe to a service according to the ownership of a monitor and the probe time. The packet processing engine may examine activity status of the monitor to determine if the packet processing engine owns the monitor. If the activity status is non schedulable the packet processing engine does not own the monitor. The packet processing engine then examines the activity status for the next entry in the table . In this manner the packet processing engine continues examining the entries in the table until the packet processing engine encounters a monitor that the packet processing engine owns. When the packet processing engine encounters a monitor that the packet processing engine owns the packet processing engine compares the scheduled probe time for the monitor with a signal from a clock. If the scheduled probe time is less than or equal to the signal from the clock the packet processing engine creates a probe according to the monitor and sends the probe to the service. The packet processing engine may calculate the next probe time and overwrite the probe time field of the entry with the newly calculated probe time. The packet processing engine may then continue examining the activity statuses and probe times of entries in the table until the packet processing engine .

With the examining of activity statuses and probe times and sending of probes the packet processing engine may receive and process the result of a probe. The packet processing engine may use the result of a probe to adjust a variable associated with a service. In some embodiments the packet processing engine may increment or decrement the variable according to the result of a probe. For example if the probe indicates a service is up the packet processing engine may increment the variable but if the probe indicates a service is down the packet processing engine may decrement the variable. In some embodiments the magnitude of the increment or decrement is a predetermined value. In other embodiments the magnitude of the increment or decrement depends on the result of the probe.

After adjusting the variable the packet processing engine may determine if the packet processing engine owns the service being monitored. If the packet processing engine owns the service the packet processing engine may use the variable to update the state of the service as described in . If the packet processing engine does not own the service the packet processing engine evaluates the variable associated with the service to determine if the packet processing engine needs to report the results of the probe to the owner packet processing engine . In some embodiments the packet processing engine may compare the variable with a predetermined threshold. If the variable is greater than the threshold the packet processing engine may determine if the service is already included in the list of services with probe results. If the service is not in the list the packet processing engine may add the service to the list. If the variable is less than the threshold the packet processing engine may remove the service from the list.

After the packet processing engine finishes sending probes and processing the results for the entries in the table the packet processing engine may send information regarding the results of the probes to services owned by other packet processing engines. In many embodiments the packet processing engine may examine the list of services with probe results. For each service in the list the packet processing engine may prepare a message with the service name and the value of the variable associated with the service. The packet processing engine may send the message to the packet processing engine that owns the service. The packet processing engine may delete the service from the list. In some embodiments the packet processing engine deletes the service after sending the message to the packet processing engine that owns the service. In other embodiments the packet processing engine deletes all the services from the list after all the messages with variables for the services have been sent to the respective packet processing engines. The packet processing engine returns to step to process another iteration through the table .

Referring now to a flow diagram depicting steps of an embodiment of a method for updating the state of a service in a multi core system is shown and described. The method includes receiving and processing step by a packet processing engine that owns a service also referred to herein as owner packet processing engine the probe results for the service from other packet processing engines. In some embodiments the owner packet processing engine receives a message from another packet processing engine. The message may include a service name and a value of a variable associated with the service. The value of the variable may reflect the results of probes sent to the service by the packet processing engine that sent the message. The owner packet processing engine may update a variable associated with the state of a service according to the value in the message. In some embodiments the owner packet processing engine may add the value in the message to the variable associated with the state of the service and in other embodiments the owner packet processing engine may subtract the value.

The method also includes determining step if the state of a service has changed. In some embodiments the owner packet processing engine determines if the state of a service has changed by comparing the variable associated with the state of the service to a predetermined threshold. In some embodiments the owner packet processing engine detects if the variable was previously less than the threshold and the updated owner packet processing engine exceeds the threshold. In other embodiments the owner packet processing engine detects if the variable previously exceeded the threshold and the updated variable is less than the threshold.

The method also includes sending step messages about the new state of the service to the other packet processing engines. In some embodiments in response to the detection the owner packet processing engine creates a message including the state of the service according to the updated variable. The owner packet processing engine may send the message to all of the other packet processing engines. In other embodiments in response to the detection the owner packet processing engine places the service in a list of services whose statuses have changed. In these embodiments the owner packet processing engine may create and send messages regarding the states of the services in the list on a predetermined basis. For example the owner packet processing engine may create and send the messages according to a predetermined frequency and then delete all the services from the list.

An example of monitor distribution in a multi core system is herein described. In this example the multi core system has 8 cores and monitors 4 services. The multi core system is configured to have 20 monitors that monitor the 4 services and 5 monitors are dedicated to each service. The multi core system establishes service names and monitor names for each of the 20 monitors. The multi core system may compute a hash value for each monitor based on the service and monitor names. The hash value may determine which core owns a monitor and is responsible for sending probes to the service according to the monitor. In this example a hash value may fall between 0 and 8000. If the hash value falls between 0 and 999 core 1 owns the monitor. If the hash value falls between 1000 and 1999 core 2 owns the monitor and so on. In this example core 1 owns the first service and the hash values for the monitors determine that cores 1 2 5 6 and 8 own the monitors for the first service. Core 3 owns the second service and the hash values for the monitors determine that cores 2 3 4 6 and 7 own the monitors for the second service. Core 5 owns the third service and the hash values for the monitors determine that cores 1 3 4 5 and 8 own the monitors for the third service. Core 7 owns the fourth service and the hash values for the monitors determine that cores 2 4 5 7 and 8 own the monitors for the fourth service.

Each core in the multi core system includes a table that stores entries for all 20 monitors. Each core sets the activity statuses for entries to schedulable for the monitors it owns and unschedulable for the monitors it does not own. In one example core 1 sets the activity statuses for its monitors for the first and third services to schedulable but sets activity statuses for all other monitors in its table to unschedulable. In another example core 2 sets the activity statuses for its monitors for the second and fourth services to schedulable but sets activity statuses for all other monitors in its table to unschedulable. The remaining cores set the activity statuses for monitors in its table in the same manner.

If a monitor is set to schedulable a core may send probes according to the monitor to the service. The core may receive the results of the probes. If the core does not own the service the core may send a message including the results of the probes to the owner core. For example core 1 may send the results of its probes for the third service to core 5. In another example core 4 may send the results of its probes for the second service to core 3 the results of its probes for the third service to core 5 and the results of its probes for the fourth service to core 7.

If a core does own a service the core may determine the state of the service according to results of the probes for the service. The core may determine the state by processing the results of its own probes or results sent from other cores. For example core 1 may process the results of its probes for the first service to update the state. Core 1 may also process the results of probes sent from cores 2 5 6 and 8 to update the state of the first service. In another example core 5 may process the results of its probes for the third service to update the state. Core 5 may also process the results of probes sent from cores 1 3 4 and 8 to update the state of the third service. In any of these examples once a core has updated the state of a service it owns the core may send a message to the other cores regarding the state of the service.

The systems and methods of the present solution illustrated in are directed to monitoring in a cluster system. The systems and methods distribute the monitors for a service and the ownership of a service across a cluster system comprising a plurality of nodes. The nodes in the cluster can be configured to have different sets of virtual servers and services. The ownership and monitoring of the services can be distributed among all the nodes in the cluster.

Referring now to a block diagram of an appliance using a plurality of nodes to monitor a plurality of network services in a cluster system is shown. The appliance may be a multi core appliance or multi node set of appliances in a cluster system . A node may be a connection point in a cluster system . Nodes may be capable of receiving transmitting and or forwarding information over a network. In the embodiment shown the one or more nodes may be associated with one or more network services . In other embodiments the one or more nodes may monitor an appliance vServer network service client or any other network resource. Although illustrated on a separate server in many embodiments each node within the cluster may execute one or more services . For example a first service may be executed on a first node and monitored by a first monitor or a second service may be executed on both a first and second node and such as a distributed database service and monitored by a monitor on each device with one monitor designated as an owner of the service as discussed in more detail below .

In one embodiment a node comprises a plurality of monitoring agents . The monitoring agents may be bound to a network service . A monitoring agent may comprise an application service server daemon routine subroutine or other executable logic for monitoring performance load balancing latency status or other information of a service vserver or application provided by a server and or cluster .

In yet other embodiments the monitoring agent determines availability of a network service to an HTTP request. In one of these embodiments the monitoring agent sends an HTTP command such as a get request for a uniform resource locator URL or a file to the network service and determines a time needed by the network service to respond to the request. In another of these embodiments the monitoring agent verifies that the response from the network service included expected content such as the contents of a web page identified by the URL and did not contain errors.

Cluster may be a network of appliances working together in a single system. In some embodiments the appliances may be referred to as nodes . In the cluster system network traffic may be distributed among the nodes to provide load balancing in the system. The nodes may communicate amongst each other. In some embodiments when a node is added or removed from the cluster the load in the cluster may be redistributed among the nodes still active in the cluster .

In some embodiments the service is a daemon process or network driver for listening receiving and or sending communications for an application such as email database or an enterprise application. In some embodiments the service may communicate on a specific IP address or IP address and port.

Referring now to an embodiment of a flow diagram of an embodiment of a method for distributed monitoring of one or more services across a plurality of nodes in a cluster system. At step the method includes identifying by a PE in a cluster system a service in the cluster system. At step the method also includes determining by the PE a master node for the service based upon a hash value associated with the node. At step the method further includes transmitting by the master node a service state update of the service to the other nodes in the cluster system.

In some embodiments the distribution may be done at a service level rather than at a monitor level. This design in some embodiments may help to reduce the number of probe status updates from different nodes in the cluster to the to the monitoring master. In an embodiment the distribution may be done using a probable record linkage technique sometimes referred to as PRL module the module based on a consistent hashing algorithm.

Referring to step in more detail each of the nodes in the cluster can determine a service from a plurality of services to be monitored by the corresponding node. The determined node can monitor the service for the cluster of nodes. The determined node may be referred to as a master node for the service it is monitoring. In an embodiment the node is selected to monitor the service based on a hash of an identity of the service in the configuration for the cluster. In some embodiments a service unique ID hash may be used to determine the master node for a service . In an embodiment each node may identify ownership of a service to monitor based on the hash identity of service including a name of the service configured in the configuration for the cluster. The PRL module may use the service unique ID hash to determine the master node for a service . Once the master node has been determined in some embodiments the master node may begin probing the service. In still other embodiments the master node may begin probing the service responsive to receiving a add service command from a PE in the cluster system. In further embodiments once the add service command has been received a new field may be added to update the server information and to store the unique entity ID which will be obtained from the configuration system process.

In some embodiments each node establishes responsive to the determination to monitor a service a monitor for each service to be monitored by the node. Each of the nodes may establish a master monitor among the plurality of monitors established on the node. The master node may be selected to monitor the service for the node. In an embodiment the master monitor can update the remaining monitors on the node with the status of the service. Within the node the monitor bindings may be distributed among the processing engines. The non master nodes sometimes referred to as non owner nodes or slave nodes may set a don t probe bit in all the mapped ID address sometimes referred to as MIPS associated with the service in all the processing engines so that the non master nodes do not probe the service at all.

In some embodiments each node may monitor set of services it owns or are assigned to it according to a hash of information about the services all of the services it owns or at least one of the services it owns. Each node may use the existing service state synchronization hereinafter referred to as SSS mechanism to update the service state and layer 2 information of the service in the cluster system. In some embodiments a first monitor on a first node in the cluster of nodes can identify a status of a service to be monitored by the cluster. The monitor for a service may be referred to as a master monitor a first monitor or a master packet engine.

Whenever the service state changes for a service or the monitoring owner of the service changes in some embodiments the master node s master packet engine PE0 may create a new SSS instance and populate it with the layer 2 information and service state information. The unique entity ID from the corresponding server information may be copied to a new member entity ID which may be added in the SSS data structure. In further embodiments the copied unique entity ID may be used to find the corresponding service s server information on the receiving end.

In some embodiments the master node may stop the old previous master node from monitoring the service by adding a new field to the SSS data. The new field may include data indicating the new master node for a service for all the nodes in the cluster system. In still other embodiments a new hash table may be added for efficient searching. The new hash table may include a function entity ID which can be used as an input to a hashing function and the entry ID may provide an indicator for server information. In further embodiments the entries may be added into the hash table in at least one of the following scenarios adding of a service or domain based service and adding of a service group member. In other embodiments the entries may be removed from the hash table in at least one of the following scenarios removing of a service or domain based service and removing of a service group member.

The master node or PE0 may add the SSS data to a queue for example a global list. In an embodiment the first monitor on the first node may transmit to each node in the cluster a message e.g. SSS data including the status of the service. In some embodiments the SSS data may be broadcast to all the nodes which own the service . In one embodiment the maximum number of SSS entries supported may be 25K. In still other embodiments the maximum number of SSS entries supported may be 70K. In still other embodiments any number of entries may be supported.

In some embodiments a PE in a cluster system may check whether there is any SSS entry present in the global list. In still other embodiments an application programming interface API may check every 10 ms. In further embodiments if SSS entries are present on the global list the PE may notify the nodes which own those particular services or service groups. The master node in some embodiments may broadcast the SSS entries to the owner nodes using a node to node messaging NNM interface or protocol.

In some embodiments the SSS updates will be transmitted using the NNM service based upon a priority level in the NNM layer. In one embodiment the highest priority bit set in the NNM layer may have the highest priority level. Upon receiving the SSS update in some embodiments three conditions must be verified before updating the services server information whether server information is present whether the add service command has been receive and whether SSS update is from the current master node as discussed in more detail below.

The first condition to be verified may be whether the server information is present in the node . In some embodiments to find the server information entry corresponding to the received SSS entry the packet engine may search the hash table. If the server information is found in the node and the first condition is met then the packet engine may move on to verify the second condition. If the server information is not found in the node then the packet engine may cache the SSS entry or store the SSS entry in a cache memory.

The second condition may be verifying that the add service command was received. In some embodiments the add service command should have been received and processed by all the PEs in the node. To verify that the add service command has been received the server information reference count may be checked. In further embodiments if all the PEs have received and processed the add service command the PE may check if the third condition whether the SSS update was sent by the current master node is met. If not the SSS entry may be cached.

In an embodiment the master monitor may compare a service identity in a server database to a unique identity in the service state update to confirm the monitor is a current monitor for the service. In some embodiments to determine if the third condition has been met the PE may compare the view ID stored in the server information against the view ID received from the master node in the SSS update. If the view ID in the server information is greater than the view ID in the received message than the message did not come from the current master node and is obsolete. In this case the SSS message may be ignored. If the view ID in the server information is less than or equal to the view ID in the received message the SSS message will be used to update the server information. In some embodiments comparing the view ID of the server information to the view ID of the received message may handle issues that arise when a node receives both an add service command and a server information update message. In further embodiments the server information update may be received by a node before the node has received the add service command. By caching the server update the node can wait to update the service information until the add service command has been received.

In some embodiments to determine whether the local node is the old or previous monitoring owner of the service a comparison between the SSS monitor s view ID and the server information view ID is performed. If the SSS s monitor view ID comes out to be greater than the server information s master monitor view ID then the local node is the old or previous master. If it is determined that the local node is the old master node the master node flag on the local node may need to be reset to disable monitoring.

In some embodiments once all three conditions have been met the PE may send out a core to core messaging C2C broadcast of the received SSS entry that was sent to all the PEs. In one example without limitation a SSS entry for clustering is illustrated below 

Now referring to an illustrative diagram of a method for monitoring in a cluster system . For clarity only two nodes are illustrated but one of skill in the art may readily appreciate that the present systems and methods may be scaled up to any number of nodes within the cluster. In one embodiment a two node cluster may include nodes b0 and b1 . Two services S1 and S2 may be executed by each node such as distributed databases or applications. Monitors m1 and m2 may be bound to service S1 and m3 and m4 may be bound to S2 based on the result of a hash applied to information of service S1 and S2. S1 may be monitored by b0 while S2 is monitored by b1 . In still other embodiments within b0 m1 and m2 may be distributed among a plurality of PEs running on b0 and similarly within b1 m3 and m4 may be distributed among a plurality of PEs running on b1. Whenever S1 s state changes b0 may inform b1 via a service update message . Similarly whenever S2 s state changes b1 may inform b0 via a service update message .

Now referring to a flow diagram of a configuration event in a cluster system is illustrated. In some embodiments a configuration event may be an event generated from a configuration change e.g. a topology change to the cluster . In an embodiment ownership of the services in the cluster may be redistributed among the nodes in the cluster in response to a configuration event in the cluster. In one embodiment the configuration event changes a topology of the cluster. Examples without limitations of a configuration change include adding or deleting a service or naming a service or a service group. In further embodiments when a new service named service service group member is added a clustering specific processing function may performed to distribute monitoring among the active nodes in the cluster such as an RSS hash of information about each service to distribute monitoring of said services among the nodes. The monitor of a service may generate a service state update for the service in response to the configuration event in the cluster. The monitor may keep re transmitting an acknowledgment message to each node in the cluster until each node in the cluster acknowledges receipt of the service state update.

In some embodiments to distribute the monitoring the following operations may be performed by the distribute event handler. At step the distribute event handler may check if the clustering is enabled or not. If the clustering is not enabled then no operations need to be performed. At step the distribute event handler may identify if the local node is part of the Open vSwitch OVS . If the local node is not part of OVS then no operations will be performed at this time. Whenever the node joins the cluster at a later point then the clustering specific operations may performed then. At step the distribute event handler may determine if the service is an internal service. If the service is an internal service than no monitoring distribution is required. At step the distribute event handler may check if the service is owned by the local node or not. This check may be required due to asymmetric configuration of all the services that are not owned by all the nodes in the cluster. If the node does not own the service then do not perform any operations. At step the distribute event handler may calculate the hash key of the service based on the entity ID. At step the distribute event handler may obtain the PRL list and find the first intersection of the node that will be the monitoring owner of the service. At step the distribute event handler may determine if the owner node ID is the local node ID.

At step if the local node is the monitoring master of the add service then in some embodiments the distribute event handler may set a flag in the server information representing the current node as the master node. In further embodiments the distribute event handler may enable the monitoring for the service. In still other embodiments the distribute event handler may copy the current view ID from the global list to the master node. At step the distribute event handler may determine if the monitoring distribution was called due to addition of a new service. At step the distribute event handler may set the server information value to zero. Because the service may be a new service no node will have previously updated the service state so it may be initialized. At step the monitoring distribution API may be called to redistribute the existing service ownership. To redistribute the existing ownership the API may send an SSS broadcast update message to declare the new ownership and to avoid race conditions. At step if the local node is not the monitoring master of the add service in some embodiments the server information monitoring flag is reset and the server information master view is updated. The monitoring may be disabled when the new owner updates by sending SSS message.

Now referring to illustrated is a flow diagram of a configuration change in a cluster system such as deleting an entity. In some embodiments whenever an existing service named service or service group member is deleted no clustering specific processing will be required. However in other embodiments configuration messages may need to be broadcast to avoid race conditions or other errors.

In some embodiments a quorum service provider may send messages to all nodes in the form of events whenever any node joins or leaves the OVS. When a node event handling occurs a new application type may be registered in the PE cluster module and corresponding new application handles will be added to the command list. In further embodiments multiple events can occur simultaneously. In such cases the PE will queue the core to core messaging CCM events in a new list for later processing by the system by the PE.

In some embodiments when a node joins the OVS an event will be generated by the Quorum Service Provider QSP and it will be sent to all the PEs of all the nodes. The add event message may be queued onto the CCM events list. Each PE may call the event handler for the join event responsive to receiving the event from the QSP.

Still referring to in some embodiments the following operations will be performed by the join event handler. At step the join event handler may determine if the clustering is enabled or not. If the clustering is not enabled then no more operations may be necessary. At step the join event handler may identify if the local node is part of the OVS. If the local node is not part of OVS then no more operations need to be performed. At step the join event handler may determine if the local node is the new node due to which join event has been received. At step the join event handler may determine if the local PE is PE0. At step if the local node is not the newly joined node then in some embodiments the PE0 may only go through all the server information in the global server and send service state update SSS of the services to which the local node is monitoring to the newly added node. At step in some embodiments if the local node is not the newly added node then the PE may go through all the server information in the global server and call the distribute event handler to redistribute the monitoring ownership for all the services in the list.

Now referring to illustrated is a flow diagram illustrating a when a node leaves a cluster. In some embodiments when any node leaves the cluster for example and without limitation because either it has gone down or the node has been removed from the cluster by configuration an event will be received by all the nodes in the cluster. In further embodiments the event notification may be transmitted by a PE. In still other embodiments the leave event may be queued onto the CCM events list.

In some embodiments the following operations may be performed by a leave event handler. At step a leave event handler may determine if clustering is enabled or not. If the clustering is not enabled than no more operations need to be performed. At step the leave event handler may identify if the local node is part of the OVS. If the local node is not part of the OVS then no more operations need to be performed. At step each of the PEs may access the server information in the global server and call the distribute handler to distribute the monitoring for all the services in the list. In some embodiments a PE NNM message handling interface may provide facility to parse and call message handlers based on the message groups and their respective messages types.

Now referring to illustrated is a method for redistribution of ownership of services in a cluster system . At step in some embodiments of distributed monitoring within a cluster a plurality of nodes may each monitor the services they have ownership of. At Step a change in the number of nodes active in the cluster may be detected or the nodes may receive a notification of a change in the number of active nodes. In some embodiments the change may be detected responsive to a node joining the cluster . In other embodiments the change may be detected responsive to a node leaving the cluster or becoming unresponsive. If no change in the number of nodes in a cluster is detected the nodes may continue to monitor the services they each own. At step further comprising steps in some embodiments if a change in the number of nodes has been detected the ownership of services may be redistributed among the plurality of nodes active in the cluster . The services in some embodiments may be redistributed to balance the load in the cluster . In other embodiments the services may be redistributed equally among the plurality of nodes in the cluster . In further embodiments the redistribution of ownership of services may be performed according to method as discussed above.

At step as part of step a master node for each service may be determined based upon a hash value associated with the node . At step the new owner of the service may send an acknowledgement to the old owner of the service . The acknowledgement may indicate to the old owner that the service has a new owner node . At step the old owner may stop monitoring the service upon receiving notice from the new owner node . The old owner node may continue to monitor the services it still has ownership of. If there are additional services and monitoring duties or ownership to redistribute then steps may be repeated in some embodiments. In many embodiments steps may performed iteratively for each service for which monitoring is to be redistributed or may perform the steps in parallel or serial for the services. For example step may be performed for each service then steps and for each service.

Now referring to illustrated is a block diagram of an appliance used for monitoring of one or more services across a plurality of nodes in a cluster system using path monitoring illustrated in dashed lines . The appliance may be a multi core or multi node in a cluster system . A node may be a connection point in a cluster system and may be capable of receiving transmitting or forwarding information over a network. In the embodiment shown the one or more nodes may be associated with one or more network services . In other embodiments the one or more nodes may monitor an appliance vServer network service client or any other network resource with each node designated as the owner of a service and monitoring said service solid line . Each owner may communicate status of their monitored service to the other nodes via node to node messaging. Each service may also have a path monitoring capability.

In some embodiments a monitor for a service may enable a path monitoring option for the service. The path monitoring may allow all nodes in a cluster to determine reachability to the service without communicating with the master node . In one embodiment when the path monitoring option is enabled non owner nodes in the cluster may probe the service to determine a service reachability from the respective node to the service. As shown in some embodiments path monitoring may be performed by all nodes in the cluster system to each service irrespective of whether a node owns the service or not to verify reachability of each service by the node. Once each node has determined the service reachability the non owner nodes may transmit a path monitoring state update to the owner node e.g. monitor of the service. The path monitoring state update may include the service reachability for the respective node to the service. The monitor of the service may update a status of the service with the service reachability information for each node in the cluster.

Now referring to a diagram of a method for monitoring of one or more services across a plurality of nodes in a cluster system. At step the method may include identifying by a PE in a cluster system a service in the cluster system. At step the method may also include identifying by the PE a master node for the service based upon a hash value associated with the node. At step the method may further include identifying by the PE a path monitoring state for a service. At step the method further includes transmitting by the master node a service state update of the service to the other nodes in the cluster system.

The feature of probing the service from all the cluster nodes to check individual reachability may be referred to as Path monitoring. Path monitoring may be enabled configured or disabled via add and set commands for service and service groups providing granular control on a per service level. By default the pathMonitor option may be disabled for all the service and service groups. When a PE enables the validate path option for any given service each node that owns or executes the service may start probing the service using ICMP ping probes . In some embodiments the effective service state may be calculated at the time when SSS update may be received from the monitoring owner of the service. Individual nodes can have different service state based on the service reachability from the node.

In some embodiments the method may include the path monitoring state for a service being disabled initially. In still other embodiments the method may include enabling by a PE the path monitoring state for a service . In further embodiments the method may include probing by the master node the service using the path monitor of the service. In various embodiments the service state update of the service may include both the service state and the path monitoring state.

In one implementation the method may include disabling by a master node the path monitoring status of a service . The path monitoring status may be disabled using a service command. In still other embodiments the method may include transmitting by the master node that the path monitoring of a service has been disabled to the cluster system .

Individual nodes may have different service states based on the service reachability from the node. In some embodiments a PE might want to bring down the service on each and every node of the cluster even if only one node is not able to reach the service . For example if a plurality of nodes are communicating with a database and one node is unable to reach the database a PE may choose to restart the service rather than have a percentage of requests go unfulfilled. In some embodiments the pathMonitorIndv option may be enabled by default and this option will be configurable only if the validatePath option is enabled. In an embodiment if the pathMonitorIndv is disabled then the service will be advertised down if one or more nodes are not able to reach the service.

In some embodiments for any given service each node may send the path monitor state update message to the monitoring owner of the service. The path monitoring state update message may consist of two parameters a unique ID of the service and the current path monitor state. Upon receiving the enable path monitoring command the default pathmon monitor may be created if not present. In further embodiments the monitor may be bound to the service. In still other embodiments the path monitor may be enabled on only OVS nodes though the enable pathmon will be fired on all the online CVS nodes to ensure no passive nodes will monitor service. The path monitoring cache may be checked so as to fetch all the path monitoring updates from the other OVS nodes that could have been received before enable pathmon command or even before add service command was fired on the local node. Then in some embodiments the local node PM probe may update the master node with the local PM state and the bitmap will be updated accordingly.

In some embodiments upon receiving the disable path monitoring command the path monitor will be unbound from the service. On non master nodes the backed up state may be re enforced. The backup state may store the latest monitoring state told to the node by the monitoring owner. In still other embodiments on the master node state recalculation may be triggered and the MOS will send the SSS update incase a change in state is detected.

In various embodiments each and every OVS node might use path monitoring and whenever there is a change in the path monitoring mip state the node may broadcast the path monitoring update to all the active nodes on CVS set. In some embodiments the incoming traffic may be redirected from a node n0 which has lost its connectivity with the network or services to other nodes which are still able to reach the services. In further embodiments to notify other nodes of the loss of connectivity each vserver and service may have a processing set associated with it and the processing set to be updated on each and every node based on path monitoring bitmap to make it aware of which services are reachable from which all nodes.

In further embodiments such as in the case of master node change online client virtualization service CVS which may not be part of OVS can become the new master node. When the CVS becomes the new master node the path monitoring bitmap may be updated along with the service state to allow it to monitor and update correctly. In still other embodiments when a new node joins to the online CVS set the node may be synced with the following information before it may be allowed to become part of OVS each of the MOS nodes may send an SSS update to the newly joined node and each node may send the path monitoring updates for each and every service for which path monitor is active.

In some embodiments when a change in the state of the path monitoring occurs the local node may send the path monitoring update via a C2C message to the monitoring master to update if the monitoring master core does not own or is bound to the service. In further embodiments the node will broadcast the PM update message to all the nodes in the online CVS. One non limiting example of a PM update message will be as shown below 

In various embodiments the same structure nsmc mon pm update msg may be sent as payload of node to node path monitoring update message. As the path monitoring update is broadcast to all the online CVS nodes the update can land on any core on the destination node. Accordingly the same core to core messaging service may be used to transmit the remote path monitoring update to the monitoring master.

In some embodiments upon receiving the path monitoring update the master node may update its local bitmap with the information received in the path monitoring update irrespective of whether it is in OVS or not or it is the master node or not. In still other embodiments if the recipient is not part of OVS then the node may no longer receive path monitoring update messages. In further embodiments where the recipient node is part of OVS then the processing may be based on whether the node is the master node of the service or not. If the node is the master node of the service then in some embodiments the node will recalculate the service state based on the updated bitmap and send an SSS update with any change in service state. Otherwise if the node is not the master node of the service then it will just digest the path monitoring update without doing any processing.

In some embodiments where the individual path monitoring decision option is ENABLED then all the non master nodes may override their own state if the PM mip state is DOWN. Further non master nodes may also take backup of the service state to reinstate the original state back in case of disabling of path monitor . In various embodiments the backed up state may be refreshed by the SSS update from the master node in case there is any update while the service state is DOWN on the local node due to individual path monitoring decision.

The PM updates can be broadcast even if the individual path monitoring decision option is enabled as possessing set of the services is required to be updated. In some embodiments when the individual path monitoring decision option is disabled which it may be by default the master node may consider the path monitoring bitmap for computation of the service state and send the service state as down if even a single node in the current OVS is not able to reach the service. Rest processing may be the same as in cases where the individual path monitoring decision option is disabled.

Now referring to illustrated is one illustrative example of a method for monitoring services in a cluster using path monitors. In the two node cluster system has nodes b0 and b1 . Two services S1 and S2 are executed on each node as well as monitors m1 and m2 which are bound to S1 and m3 and m4 which are bound to S2. Path monitors P1 and P2 may be executed for services S1 and S2 respectively. In some embodiments the path monitor is not bonded to the actual sip. A separate sip may be created for any given service whenever validatePath option is enabled.

In one embodiment a hash of identifiers of service S1 may yield b0 and a hash of identifiers of S2 may yield b1 . Accordingly the active monitor bindings on each node may include 

In further embodiments whenever a service state changes each node may update all other nodes about the service state change. The path monitors may be enabled on each and every node of the cluster for all the services. Responsive to status determined by the path monitors each node may send reachability states for the service e.g. up or reachable or down or unreachable to the monitoring owner of the service.

In one implementation for DBS services there may be two bindings for example primary server information and secondary server information. The ownership of the two bindings may be given to the same node as the ownership is service based. In further embodiments whenever there is an IP address change the owner node may send update to the other nodes in the cluster as part of SSS service state update. The recipient node may update the IP address and the service state accordingly. In some implementations script based monitoring may be done by the master node and states may be transmitted to all the other nodes.

Now referring to illustrated is a diagram of a method for handling monitoring of dynamic response time monitors DRTM . To handle dynamic response time monitors in some embodiments the ownership of all the services to which DRTM monitor has been bounded may be moved to the same node irrespective of vserver binding so that no node to node messages need to be sent. This may be done because response times may change every probe and accordingly sending updated response times may be very expensive. In various embodiments the owner node will know the response time of all the services to which a DRTM monitor is bound and therefore can calculate the dynamic timeout intervals independently. Accordingly during redistribution of monitoring duties at step of method illustrated in if DRTM monitors are bound to services method may be executed.

Specifically at step a determination may be made as to whether a service is bound to a dynamic response time monitor DRTM . If so at step a first node may be selected as owner node . Although referred to as a first node the first node may be any node in the cluster system and this term is used simply to differentiate the DRTM monitoring node from other nodes. In fact the DRTM monitoring node may in many instances be selected via a hash value as discussed above for the first iteration of step . If a service is not bound to a DRTM at step an owner node for a service may be identified based upon a hash value associated with the node as discussed above. In some embodiments Step may be the same method as method . If there are other services for which monitoring needs to be distributed then steps may be repeated for each additional service. When the same service or another service bound to a DRTM comes up during an iteration of steps the same first node may be selected at step such that the chosen node is utilized for monitoring all services bound to a DRTM. In many embodiments steps and may each include steps of method of discussed above.

In some embodiments to handle least response time method LRTM the monitoring will be distributed by the standard monitoring distribution discussed above and the MOS may send response time LRTM messages or updates to all the other nodes. In various embodiments the total response time may be used by all the nodes to perform load balancing. The LRTM message may be sent only after current monitor has successfully sent at least one SSS update to all the nodes in some embodiments. In still other embodiments the LRTM update may only be sent if at least one LRTM enabled monitor is attached with the service and the service is bound to at least one vserver whose load balancing method is set to LRTM. In further embodiments the LRTM information message may be sent only if the total response time has diverted by at least 5 from the last sent value. The LRTM info may also be synced with the SSS update before the node joins OVS.

In some embodiments to handle custom loading distributions the monitoring may be distributed by standard monitoring distribution and the MOS may send the following information to all the other nodes threshold reached flag load learnt from the load monitors and round robin Rr contributions. In various embodiments the above three parameters may be used by all the nodes to perform load balancing in case load balancing method is set to least load. The custom load message may only be sent after current monitor has successfully sent at least one SSS update to all the nodes. In some embodiments the custom load update may send only an if at least one custom load enabled monitor is attached with the service. The custom load info message may only be sent in some embodiments if either load has diverted by at least 5 from the last sent value or the threshold flag has changed. In some embodiments the custom load info may be synced with the SSS update before the node joins OVS.

In some embodiments because traffic may be evenly distributed among nodes a simple monitor may be sufficient for the requirement of monitoring a cluster system. For example and without limitation inline HTTP S monitor and traffic monitor TCP.
