The present innovations generally address the creation storage and usage of encrypted objects and object enabled applications. Some embodiments relate to the use of encrypted object storage containers and corresponding data structures in order to guide a user through the creation of encrypted bin objects.

Modern computing platforms generate data in a multitude of different file formats. Data files may contain audio visual such as photos drawings and or the like textual or other types of information. Data files may contain or describe personal information that users desire to keep private. Users may access their files and may frequently update the file contents or create different versions of a file. Encryption may be used to convert an ordinary file into a secure file that can only be read by those possessing a key. 

The leading number of each reference number within the drawings indicates the figure in which that reference number is introduced and or detailed. As such a detailed discussion of reference number would be found and or introduced in . Reference number is introduced in etc.

The BIN ENABLED DATA OBJECT ENCRYPTION AND STORAGE APPARATUSES METHODS AND SYSTEMS hereinafter MBIN user interface transform unencrypted objects into secure bin enabled objects via MBIN components in response to user bin object storage requests. In some embodiments this is carried out in real time.

In alternative embodiments a bin guide may be provided by the MBIN in order to facilitate the collection of various bin objects such as documents photos and or the like that are connected with or associated with a given user task. For example a bin guide that is associated with a user wallet bin may contain guide instructions that will direct and or facilitate the user s collection of data and the formation of bin objects from items typically in a user s wallet. An example wallet bin guide may prompt the user to photograph both sides of their license collect important account numbers and or customer service data and or the like. By allowing the aggregation of data and leveraging the user device s camera the MBIN may enable a user to follow best practices in the collection of data connected with a certain activity a certain location and or the like. Other example bin guides may provide instructions and or functionality for aggregating data and creating bin objects associated with for example the items in the user s house a user s car financial statements associated with a user s account items that a user has not yet purchased but which the user desires to acquire individuals that the user has met and or interacted with and or the like. In some embodiments the MBIN may use bin guides that are provided by bin cloud and or developed by other users of the bin cloud. In so doing user may leverage knowledge regarding data acquisition best practices as shared through a community of MBIN users.

In one embodiment user device encrypts the content and or file generated by a user e.g. and stores the encrypted file on the local user device in a manner such that the information is encrypted while at rest on the user device but may be still easily consumed and or used by the user. In some embodiments user device may synchronize a bin object that has been encrypted with bin cloud e.g. . The bin cloud may contain multiple bins associated with an individual user of the cloud and or one or more bins associated with other MBIN users. In some embodiments of the MBIN a user may designate a bin as a shared bin and such a bin may thereafter be synchronized with other devices and or users that are trusted by the primary user. For example a trusted shared bin user may utilize a user device that has been configured to maintain a shared bin e.g. . In one embodiment the trusted shared bin user device may create a public and private encryption key set and provide the public key to user device and or bin cloud e.g. for use in encrypting bin objects and or the encryption keys associated with encrypted bin objects that are to be synchronized with the trusted shared bin user device .

In one embodiment user device may in addition to providing an encrypted bin object to bin cloud in additionally provide a symmetrical encryption decryption key suitable for decrypting encrypted bin object . The symmetrical decryption key provided by user device may be itself encrypted using the trusted shared bin user device provided public key e.g. no. In so doing the user device may advantageously provide a single version of an encrypted object to bin cloud in for synchronization to a plurality of shared bin user devices and provide one or more encrypted decryption keys that are each readable by at least one shared bin user device. In some embodiments bin cloud may thereafter synchronize the encrypted object to shared bin . Additionally bin cloud may provide the necessary decryption key for encrypted object but may provide the decryption key in a form that has been encrypted with public key e.g. . In so doing user device and trusted shared bin user device may synchronize bins collections of bins and or objects stored in bins utilizing bin cloud in while not providing access to bin objects to adversaries that may gain access to bin cloud in and or that may be able to observe communication between the bin cloud and the various devices that are so connected to enable the bin and bin object synchronization.

In other embodiments of the MBIN user device may provide multiple versions of encrypted bin objects for synchronization. For example in addition to encrypted bin object a second encryption object representing the same underlying file contents may be generated by user device using credentials provided by trusted shared bin user device in order to encrypt the object for synchronization. In so doing the MBIN may be configured such that each object stored in a shared bin is comprised of multiple encrypted versions each readable only by a single user and or a single user device. Furthermore increased security may be achieved such as when an individual trusted shared user device has been compromised. In such a configuration the MBIN may enable the rotation of future object encryption keys such that an adversary in possession of a trusted shared bin user device may not have access to future bin synchronized objects.

In one embodiment bin cloud may contain a plurality of bin scenario templates that may be queried dynamically or preloaded onto user device . In other embodiments scenario templates may be provided by or contained within bin definition templates. The MBIN scenario handler may parse the user input utilizing an integrated or third party natural language parsing library to determine a primary scenario handler template such as a lost wallet handler template. Examples of natural language processing libraries suitable for this processing include Apache OpenNLP Natural Language Toolkit NLTK 2.0 and or the like. In other embodiments the user may provide scenario handler input by selecting one or more predefined scenarios from a list. Additionally in further embodiments the user may customize their scenario selection utilizing a predefined list of scenario customization capabilities that the scenario handler has been configured to customize based on. An example scenario handler template substantially in the form of an HTTP S POST message including XML formatted data is provided below 

The bin scenario handler template may have multiple actions associated with the invocation of the scenario. By utilizing the encrypted bin object store that may be available on user device and or in a bin cloud in communication with the user device the scenario handler may utilize not only information that is present on the local user device but may leverage application programming interfaces available through the bin cloud objects contained in shared bins and or the like. In one embodiment the invocation of the bin scenario handler made provide user guidance actions e.g. local bin actions e.g. bin cloud actions e.g. triggered actions e.g. and or the like.

In one embodiment user guidance actions may take the form of instructions to the user of actions to perform bin objects to create and or other activities to initiate or engage in as a result of the scenario invocation. For example in a lost wallet scenario the user guidance action may instruct the user to file a police report and utilize the user device integrated global positioning system antenna and an automated Internet search to provide the user with instructions and or the location of the nearest police station at which to file the report. In one embodiment local bin actions e.g. may include actions that either request or automatically collect information and store it in a local user device bin and or synchronize the bin objects to a third party to the bin cloud and or the like. For example in the lost wallet scenario described herein a local bin action may instruct the user to point their user device camera at a completed police report and may automatically store and or parse data contained in the police report for storage as MBIN encrypted object or objects in a local bin. In some embodiments the cloud actions e.g. may include actions that are taken either automatically upon invocation of a bin scenario or upon instruction of user . For example a bin cloud action associated with a lost wallet scenario handler may create a snapshot of the user s wallet bin that has been previously synchronized to the bin cloud. In so doing a record of the contents of the user s wallet at the time of loss may be provided by the MBIN and potentially utilized in establishing a loss record for user . In some embodiments actions invoked by the bin scenario handler may be contingent upon one another invoked only after the completion of one or more other actions and or dependent upon a bin scenario template or user defined custom logic. For example bin cloud action instructing the bin cloud to preserve a snapshot of the user s wallet bin may invoke a linked action e.g. that automatically shares the contents of the bin snapshot with the police agency the user reports their lost wallet to. However the user guidance action to file a police report may itself be contingent upon connected to and or linked with e.g. a local bin action such as the storage of a bin object containing a photo of the please report. In such a scenario the bin handler may provide functionality to perform optical character recognition upon the photo of the please report in order to determine the appropriate agency the user filed the report with. An example library suitable for performing optical character recognition is Tesseract. As a result of that determination the bin cloud action e.g. may thereafter be successfully invoked to share the wallet snapshot with the previously identified police agency. In such configurations the MBIN scenario handler may therefore temporarily pause or suspend scenario actions while waiting for other actions within the scenario to complete or reach a determine state such that the relevant action can proceed.

In some embodiments the bin scenario handler may invoke triggered actions e.g. . Triggered actions may include actions that are external to the MBIN system yet are invoked by definitions present in a bin scenario handler template e.g. . For example a triggered action may be associated with a lost wallet scenario handler such that the Department of Motor Vehicles in the user s home country may be notified immediately upon invocation of the lost wallet scenario handler. Similarly card issuers such as credit card issuers may be notified that the user s payment cards have been lost. The information relevant to triggered actions need not in all embodiments be specified in the definition of the triggered action. For example a bin scenario handler for a lost wallet that utilizes encrypted bin objects representing card data may be configured to extract the customer service number from each encrypted object which may be a photo of the front and back of the user s payment card and notify the issuer utilizing such information. In such a configuration the triggered actions may be defined independent of the bin object contents yet be configured to utilize content that may be stored within bin objects at the time the scenario handler is ultimately invoked. Additionally in some embodiments upon scenario invocation one or more transactions may be engaged in by the bin scenario handler on behalf of the user. For example a user who has recently lost their wallet may be automatically enrolled in a credit report monitoring service as a result of a bin scenario handler. In some embodiments additional details provided to the bin scenario handler may be utilized to customize a base scenario. As such bin scenario customizer may utilize the additionally provided information that a user invoking a base handler such as the lost wallet scenario handler had additional characteristics associated with the invocation such as the user was traveling and the user lost a plane ticket in connection with their lost wallet. The scenario customizer may then utilize bin scenario handler definitions associated with other scenario templates and or sub scenario templates associated with the primary bin scenario handler in order to customize the actions that are initiated by the base scenario handler. For example the bin scenario customizer may customize triggered action that requests that card issuers be alerted of the user s card loss upon invocation of the base handler. The bin scenario customizer with an awareness that the user is additionally traveling may be configured to request that expedited overseas delivery e.g. be requested for delivery of replacement cards to the user while traveling. Furthermore the bin scenario customizer may utilize the additional scenario invocation information that the user has lost their plane tickets to request a completely new triggered action configured to invoke an airline s lost plane ticket request application programming interface in order to proactively request that the user be issued replacement tickets and or be converted from a physical ticket to an electronic ticket e.g. . By combining the capabilities of the bin scenario handler and the bin scenario customizer with the other MBIN capabilities described herein such as the ability for a user to source bin scenarios from other users and or from the bin cloud complex scenario templates and bin scenario handlers may be provided to the user preconfigured with options relevant to either the majority of users or to users similarly situated as the current user. For example the bin cloud may recommend a scenario handler with many scenario customizations relevant to international travel to a user who frequently stores bin objects in their travel information bin that indicates the user frequently travels outside their home country. Similarly the bin cloud may alternatively provide bin scenario handlers that are simplified and or require less user interaction to users that infrequently travel.

In one embodiment the user device may transmit a secure storage set up request containing information from create secure storage input to MBIN server . The secure storage set up request may be generated natively by the user device or in some embodiments by an application the user has installed on their user device for purposes of facilitating secure bin object storage. MBIN server may receive the secure storage set up request and extract or determine a device identity. Thereafter the MBIN server may create a device linked certificate that may be used to authenticate and secure future communication with the user device e.g. . In one embodiment the device linked certificate may facilitate device to MBIN server communication over Secure Sockets Layer SSL . In some embodiments the device certificate may be in the form of the cryptographic public key the may be used by the user device to encrypt future communications directed to MBIN server and additionally may allow MBIN server to verify that the user device associated with a future communications or API request is the same device that initiated the initial secure storage set up request. In some embodiments MBIN server may generate a device certificate and sign the certificate using a third party certificate authority such that a chain of certification trust may be independently verified by the user device. In other embodiments MBIN server may act as its own certificate authority and therefore sign the created device certificate acting as its own certificate authority. In embodiments where the MBIN server acts as its own certificate authority the OpenSSL library may be used to generate a device linked certificate. For example in acting as its own certificate authority MBIN server may initially generate a signed root certificate. Example commands for generating a root certificate and signing the generated root certificate substantially in the form of a series of bash shell commands is 

In order to generate a device linked API certificate in some embodiments the user device may generate a private key and a certificate signing request. Example commands for generating a device private key and a certificate signing request substantially in the form of a series of bash shell commands is 

In some embodiments the user device certificate signing request may be provided to MBIN server as part of secure storage setup request . In some embodiments MBIN server may respond to the secure storage set up request with a device linked API certificate . The device linked API certificate may be linked to the user device such that another device in possession of the API certificate would not be able to impersonate the authenticated user device. Example commands for generating a device linked API certificate substantially in the form of a series of bash shell commands is 

In one embodiment upon receipt of the device linked API certificate the user device may thereafter generate an asymmetrical encryption key pair e.g. a public private encryption key pair for use in facilitating MBIN storage operations e.g. . Example commands for generating a user device public private key pair substantially in the form of a series of bash shell commands is 

The user device may thereafter encrypt the generated private key using a key derivation function and password provided by user in connection with create secure store input . Additionally the user device may encrypt the generated private key using in one embodiment a string representing a concatenation of one or more user security questions provided in connection with the create secure store input . For example if user indicated in connection with create secure storage input that their favorite color was blue and their high school mascot was an eagle the user s private key may be encrypted using a key generated from lowercase concatenation of the two answers e.g. concat blueeagle and or the like. In other embodiments the user may provide answers to multiple security questions and or security questions in addition to those required to generate the encrypted private key. In such embodiments the MBIN may facilitate the creation of multiple versions of the user s encrypted private key that may be decrypted utilizing various combination of the user s security question answers. For example if a user provided or was requested to provide answers to three security questions such as answers X Y and Z their private key may be encrypted utilizing multiple permutations of two security question answers e.g. X Y X Z Y Z and or the like. In so doing the user may later be able to decrypt their security answer encrypted private key using less than all of the answers to the security questions provided by the user. This feature may allow a user to successfully retrieve their private key from an encrypted private key when they have forgotten or otherwise lost some of the information comprising one or more of the security answers utilized in generating the encrypted private key. Example commands for generating private key encryption keys using a user s password input and security question answers in conjunction with a key derivation function substantially in the form of Objective C code is 

The keys generated using the user s password and security question answers may thereafter in one embodiment by used to encrypt the user s private key. By encrypting the generated private key using information provided by and only known to user the private key may be provided to one or more third parties such as MBIN server while simultaneously not allowing said third parties access to the underlying private key such that they may decrypt objects encrypted using the generated public key. In so doing the MBIN facilitates a mechanism by which one or more parties may encrypt data e.g. using the generated public key while simultaneously storing an encrypted copy of the private key corresponding to the used public key and yet be unable to decrypt either the private key or the object encrypted using the public key.

In one embodiment the user device may store the generated public key in a local storage in communication with the user device e.g. . In other embodiments the encrypted private keys may additionally be stored on the user device local storage. In one embodiment the user device may transmit the private key encrypted using the selected user password the private key encrypted using one or more security answers or other data provided by user a representation of the selected user password input and the public key corresponding to the encrypted private key to MBIN server e.g. . An example credential transfer message substantially in the form of an HTTP S POST message including XML formatted data is provided below 

In some embodiments MBIN server may utilize a database and or escrow storage to store the multiple versions of the encrypted user private key the user s public key and or the like for future use in MBIN operations.

In some embodiments the key and credential transfer may include a clear text encrypted and or hashed version of the password selected by user and used in one of the provided private key encryptions. In embodiments where the user password is provided unencrypted MBIN server may utilize a hashing function to generate a storable representation of the user password suitable for authenticating the user via a different bin access vector such as a bin web portal and or the like. In embodiments where the user password provided e.g. has already been encrypted and or hashed by the user device MBIN server may additionally encrypt and or hash the password e.g. encrypt a hash hash a hash encrypt a ciphertext and or the like . In so doing adversaries that were able to intercept key and data transfer may be prevented from asserting themselves as user and or the user device.

In one embodiment upon successful authentication of the user s account utilizing the hashed password the MBIN server may retrieve previously deposited encrypted private keys associated with the user which have been encrypted using the user s password e.g. . Furthermore a device linked API certificate may be retrieved. In other embodiments the device linked API certificate may be regenerated based on a known device identifier or other device specific information such that each secure object storage device login request generates a unique device linked API certificate.

MBIN server may then reply with a generated device linked API certificate and the encrypted private key for the user e.g. . The user device may then create an authenticated local device bin storage session and or create required session artifacts e.g. in order to instantiate the device s login to the secure object storage. Further detail with respect to creating an authenticated local device bin storage session may be found with respect to e.g. BDSES component .

In one embodiment the user device may store a local pin enabled encryption API certificate e.g. and a local pin enabled encrypted private key e.g. in a user device local storage . In so doing the user may in some embodiments utilize their pin to quickly gain access to encrypted objects using their device without being required to undergo a full device authentication and or login because the necessary credentials have been PIN secured on the user s device in connection with the secure object storage device session creation.

A user PIN selection input e.g. may be utilized in connection with a cryptographic key derivation function in order to generate a key suitable for encrypting object access keys while at rest on the user secure storage device. Further detail regarding generating encryption keys using a PIN input may be found with respect to . In one embodiment a storage device may query an encryption security database for the minimum requirements necessary for use of a key derivation function for pin enabled storage e.g. . For example the minimum requirement for a derivation function may require a minimum number of rounds during the generation of the encryption key from the PIN input. If a key derivation function is not available that meets the required security parameters e.g. the user secure storage device may then initiate a no device artifact storage session as described above. In so doing even when PIN enabled storage is not allowed or not available to a user secure storage device access to encrypted bin objects may be maintained through communication with MBIN server and or the like. In embodiments where a suitable key derivation function is available e.g. the derivation function may be executed on the user PIN selection input to derive a PIN enabled encryption key e.g. .

In one embodiment the user secure storage device may then decrypt the received encrypted private key using the password input provided by user . If the received encrypted private key is not decryptable using the password input the user may be prompted to reenter their password. In other embodiments the user may provide answers to their account security questions established upon secure storage account creation. In still other embodiments the user may initiate an MBIN server facilitated password reset e.g. either independently or in connection with the provision of their security question answers.

If the encrypted private key is successfully decrypted using the user password input e.g. the private key may be immediately recrypted using the PIN enabled encryption key generated earlier e.g. . The user secure storage device may furthermore encrypt the received API certificate using the derived PIN enabled encryption key e.g. . The private key and the API certificate may as a result be locally encrypted on the user secure storage device using the generated PIN encryption key. In some embodiments the user secure storage device may store the PIN encrypted private key and the PIN encrypted API certificate in the local device s storage area e.g. such as on the local device application accessible memory storage. Upon successfully generating the session artifacts the user s secure storage device may notify MBIN server that the device bin storage session has been successfully authenticated e.g. .

In one embodiment user may provide a bin creation input specifying the parameters to be used in creating a bin. The user input may be in the form of a tap a double tap a swipe a gesture a QR code scan a device motion a device location indication including in some embodiments an automated location indication such as a user device GPS signal and or the like e.g. . The user device may thereafter retrieve a bin template corresponding to the bin creation input. An example bin template substantially in the form of an HTTP S POST message including XML formatted data is provided below 

In one embodiment the user device may then generate an encryption key for use in encrypting bin objects for storage e.g. . In one implementation the bin key may be in the form of an AES 256 encryption key that can be used to block encrypt and decrypt bin objects. For example the bin key may utilize a block cipher in converting an unencrypted bin file object into an encrypted bin file object. The user device may thereafter encrypt the generated bin encryption key utilizing the previously generated public key. In so doing the MBIN may facilitate a capability such that a bin encryption key can only be decrypted with possession of the user s private key. Said differently because bin objects may be encrypted utilizing a symmetrical bin key and the symmetrical bin key is itself encrypted using the public key from a public private key pair an adversary would be required to obtain access to the user s private key in order to recover a bin s bin key and therefore be able to decrypt encrypted bin objects. In still further implementations bins may contain encrypted bin objects where each bin object is encrypted using a different bin key a per object key and or the like. In MBIN configurations where bin objects are synchronized to other devices bins may be configured such that bin objects are encrypted multiple times using different credentials such that the bin key used to encrypt a bin object on a given user device will not decrypt that same object in the form synchronized to another device. In one embodiment the user device may store the encrypted bin key on a user device local storage e.g. .

In one embodiment the user device may generate a bin creation request including bin metadata and the encrypted bin key and transmit the request to MBIN server e.g. . An example bin creation request substantially in the form of an HTTP S POST message including XML formatted data is provided below 

The MBIN server may thereafter verify that the user and or user device has permission to create the requested bin and apportion or allocate storage necessary for the bin and or bin objects e.g. . MBIN server may then store the encrypted bin key and the bin metadata in an MBIN database and or escrow storage .

In one embodiment the user device may request from a user local storage an encrypted private key and encrypted bin key e.g. . If available the local storage may return an encrypted private key and an encrypted bin key for use in encrypting the object to be stored in a bin e.g. . The user device may thereafter utilize the provided PIN in a key derivation function to generate a decryption key from the provided PIN and thereafter utilize the generated PIN key to decrypt the received encrypted private key e.g. . Further detail with respect to PIN key generation using a PIN input may be found herein and particularly with respect to . Upon obtaining access to the decrypted private key the user device may then utilize the private key to decrypt the encrypted bin key e.g. . The user device may thereafter utilize the decrypted bin key which in some embodiments is a symmetrical encryption key for use in encrypting the provided object for bin storage e.g. . An example library suitable for encrypting a bin object using a bin key is Apple s Common Crypto e.g. CC crypto library.

In some embodiments the encrypted bin object may thereafter be stored in the user s local device storage until access to MBIN server may be established. In some MBIN configurations access to the MBIN server may be time limited data rate throttled and or otherwise configured to optimize MBIN performance. The user device may provide the encrypted object as part of an encrypted object storage request e.g. . An example encrypted object storage request substantially in the form of an HTTP S POST message including XML formatted data is provided below 

In some embodiments as part of the bin object storage request user may provide additional metadata that describes the bin object and which may not be encrypted. In such an MBIN configuration limited metadata regarding bin encrypted objects may be obtained even in the absence of the appropriate bin object decryption credentials. MBIN server may then process the bin storage request e.g. . Further detail with respect to processing bin storage requests may be found with respect to e.g. BSR component .

In one embodiment MBIN server may store bin object metadata and the storage location of the encrypted bin object determined during processing of the bin storage request in MBIN database e.g. . Furthermore MBIN server may provide a bin storage request including the encrypted bin object and an identifier with which the object is to be associated e.g. to MBIN object server . In some MBIN configurations multiple MBIN object servers may be utilized to replicate the encrypted bin object. In one embodiment MBIN object server will store the encrypted object including the unique object identifier e.g. .

If the MBIN server determines that a user bin storage quota has not been exhausted e.g. the server may thereafter apportion storage for the bin object e.g. such as by determining the encrypted or decrypted size of the object being stored and apportioning a proportional amount of bin storage. The MBIN server may generate a unique global identifier for the object e.g. . The object identifier may be unique across all MBIN managed bins or unique only to a user or a bin. The MBIN server may then update the bin database using the received bin object metadata and the object unique identifier e.g. .

In one embodiment the MBIN server may query an endpoint database containing information about bin storage object servers and user bin redundancy requirements. User bin redundancy requirements may be set on a per bin a per user a per device and or the like and may define a number of object storage servers which must contain copies of any bin objects stored in a given bin. Bin redundancy object requirements may be employed in order to protect against MBIN object server failure with more bin object copies being used for sensitive or highly valuable bin objects. If enough object storage servers are not available to meet the bin redundancy requirements e.g. the MBIN server may determine whether the bin permissions allow a temporarily reduced bin redundancy requirements. The temporarily reduced bin redundancy requirement may allow the storage of a bin object in less than the required number of bin object storage servers for a temporary period of time such as may be the case when object storage servers are undergoing maintenance or otherwise unavailable but are expected to be available within a time quantum. If the bin permissions do not allow temporarily reduced bin redundancy requirements e.g. the MBIN server may generate a bin redundancy requirements error and transmit the error to user secure storage device for display e.g. . If user bin permissions do allow temporarily reduced bin redundancy requirements e.g. the MBIN server may set bin redundancy requirements to the number of available bin object storage servers and set a follow up trigger configured to initiate the storage of the bin object on additional servers after a time quantum e.g. . If the MBIN is configured to allow a user device to directly transfer encrypted object from the device to an object storage server e.g. the MBIN server may while the number of object storage servers storing the encrypted object is less than the bin redundancy requirement initiate or instruct the device to transfer the encrypted object directly to one or more object storage servers e.g. . The user secure storage device may thereafter transfer the encrypted object to the designated object storage server e.g. and return the transfer status to MBIN server . In other embodiments if direct device to object storage server transfer support is not enabled e.g. and while the count of the number of object storage servers containing the encrypted bin object is less than the bin redundancy requirement the MBIN server may itself transfer the object to one or more object storage servers e.g. . The logic flow continues with respect to .

With respect to in one embodiment if the encrypted object storage request is a bin that is shared with one or more devices and or one or more users e.g. then the MBIN server may determine whether the appropriate bin encryption key has been encrypted with the target devices or target users public key and transmitted to the target user or target device e.g. . If the target s bin encryption key has not been forwarded then MBIN server may request a bin key share distribution refresh via user secure storage device . The user secure storage device may thereafter encrypt the appropriate bin key with each shared target device s or shared target user s public key e.g. . MBIN server may thereafter transmit the encrypted bin key to the target devices or target users as well as store a copy in an escrow database in communication with the MBIN server e.g. . In one embodiment the MBIN server may store the encrypted object in a bin associated with the shared user or a shared device. In so doing objects stored in one bin may be automatically synchronized with additional bins by the MBIN without providing the MBIN server with access to the unencrypted objects or to credentials utilized by any device and or any user to access the various versions of the encrypted bin object. In one embodiment MBIN server may then run post encryption object bin storage processing on a bins that have been changed e.g. . The post encryption object processing may include the rotation of device keys the rotation of API access keys the decryption and re encryption of bins or bin objects and or the like. Upon completion of any required post object bin storage processing MBIN server may generate a bin storage request success message e.g. and transmit the success message to user secure storage device for display e.g. .

In one embodiment MBIN server may initiate a bin retrieval object request to MBIN server . The MBIN object server may thereafter retrieve the encrypted object and transmit the encrypted object as an object retrieval response to the user device e.g. . An example encrypted object retrieval response substantially in the form of an HTTP S POST message including XML formatted data is provided below 

In embodiments where PIN based storage has been enabled or authorized the user device may initiate an encrypted private key and an encrypted bin key request to user device local storage . In response to local storage may provide the user s encrypted private key which in some embodiments is encrypted using the PIN based key and the encrypted bin key corresponding to the encrypted object bin e.g. . In one embodiment the user device may use the user PIN to generate a PIN key such as by utilizing a key derivation function. The user device may then utilize the pin key to decrypt the received private key e.g. . Upon retrieval of the user s private key the user device may thereafter decrypt the bin key utilizing the user s private key e.g. . Upon obtaining the decrypted bin key the user device may finally decrypt the received encrypted object to produce the unencrypted bin object in a usable form e.g. such as a photo for viewing or a document for editing.

The user device may thereafter instantiate the bin application and or attach the instantiated bin application to an already instantiated bin e.g. . In embodiments where multiple user devices may communicate using the capabilities of a bin application MBIN server may transmit additional encrypted bin application setup definitions e.g. to other user devices e.g. which may themselves instantiate copies of the bin application e.g.

In one embodiment user device may load an application interaction definition template such as may be provided in an encrypted bin application setup definition . The application interaction definition template may specify the user interface and or a modified user interface as well as commands executable by the user device and or a MBIN application executing on the user device and providing MBIN capabilities. In one embodiment user may provide a bin application input . A bin application input may be any of the user comment or post associated with a bin object a user chat request and or message to another user of a shared bin a direct message between users associated with the MBIN service and or the like. User device may thereafter convert the bin application input which may be in the form of an item selection a string representing the desired user message a user device location and or the like and convert the application communication object into a bin object. In some embodiments the bin object may be substantially in the form of a text file containing a JSON structure parseable by the instantiated application and defined in the encrypted bin application setup definition . Further detail regarding a suitable parser for use in instantiating the application interaction definition templates may be found with respect to . In one embodiment the application communication bin object may be encrypted marked as a non user object such that the object may be stored in a bin associated with the application but will otherwise be hidden from users listing objects contained within the bin and stored in an associated application bin storage area e.g. . In one embodiment user device may transmit an application bin object storage request to MBIN server . In alternative embodiments user device may directly transmit the application bin object storage request to user device . For example direct user device to user device transfers may be enabled when user devices are in a given proximity to one another. Additionally the encrypted application bin object may be transferred via the storage request as defined in an chained series of transmission vectors. For example the chained transmission series may specify that initially the user device shall attempt to deliver the encrypted bin object associated with the instantiated application by a direct user device to user device transfer. In instances where the destination user device is not available the user device may attempt to store the application bin object on other devices providing MBIN services which may themselves then forward the encrypted object to the destination device when available. The chain series may further specify that where the destination device is not available and no other MBIN devices that may be able to provide an assisted object transfer are available an MBIN server may be utilized for processing the application bin object storage request . In one embodiment MBIN server may provide the received application bin object to user device e.g. . User device may receive the application bin object and store the object in a shared bin. An application associated with the shared bin may thereafter decrypt the object and invoke a handler associated with the application processing received application messages e.g. . In one embodiment the bin application may then provide an output to user e.g. . In so doing applications executing on multiple user devices may be facilitated in communicating on behalf of the user and or in support of bin object services through the use of the MBIN.

Applications or bin applications may leverage the various capabilities of the MBIN. Bin applications may utilize any MBIN capability described herein including secure bin object storage the synchronization of bin objects between multiple bin datastores the decryption of bin objects and conversion or transcoding of bin object content the creation of alternate bin objects the versioning of bin objects and or the like. In some embodiments bin applications may themselves create new bins e.g. create new bin object datastores . The bin applications may then monitor the bin objects stored in the bin add or remove objects from the bin trigger actions based upon bin contents and or the like.

For example in one embodiment a bin application may be configured to synchronize user content stored on a cloud storage service such as DropBox with a designated bin. The bin application may be configured to periodically download the content of a user s cloud storage and create bin objects corresponding to the contents therein. In one embodiment the bin application may thereafter delete the files that were synchronized into the bin from the remote cloud storage provider. In so doing a bin application can automatically secure files previously stored unencrypted on cloud storage services e.g. by creating encrypted bin objects from the files and removing the unencrypted files from the cloud storage service .

In one embodiment a bin application may create a bin that is not available to an MBIN user in the same manner as a normal bin described herein. For example a bin created by a bin application may have its visibility set to hidden and therefore not appear to a user in a list of available bins. Such a configuration of the MBIN may allow bin applications to provide enhanced services to the user. For example a hidden bin can be utilized as the storage backend for a bin application providing secure messaging services to the user. The bin application may hide the created bin from the user and instead define a custom interface that maps the user s interactions onto base MBIN operations. For example a secure messaging bin application may describe e.g. via a bin application definition file a plurality of user interface screens including interfaces to add a message recipient e.g. create a shared bin with the same secure bin application running on a second user s device to send a secure message e.g. create an encrypted bin object describing the content of one or more messages between bin application users and synchronize the encrypted bin object to bins associated with the other bin application users to delete a message e.g. to delete an encrypted bin object corresponding to a message and or the like. As illustrated a bin application can define interactions to include a number of atomic MBIN operations.

A bin application may in one configuration utilize a bin whereby all objects stored in the bin are encrypted using the same symmetric block encryption key for example an AES key . In the example messaging system described above this symmetric key may be made available to each side of the messaging conversation through the use of a shared bin. In such a configuration upon generation the symmetric block encryption key may be encrypted using multiple public keys. One of the public keys would correspond to the user or device associated with the local bin application and the encrypted key would be stored locally and or on a bin datastore synchronization server such that the key is available in the future to the local bin application. Other of the public keys may correspond to a user or device associated with the bin application running on a remote device and in communication with a remote synchronized bin. Once encrypted the encrypted symmetric block encryption key would then be synchronized to the remote device for use decrypting the contents of the shared bin objects encrypted by the bin application under the given key.

In other configurations of the MBIN a bin may contain sub bins. The sub bins may be logical sub bins such that they are in fact discrete bins themselves e.g. not contained by a parent bin but are presented to and available to a bin application as sub bins e.g. forming a hierarchy of bins . In still other configurations the sub bins may in fact be bin objects of their parent bins. Sub bins whether actual or logical may be utilized by bin applications to provide enhanced security for bin application functions. For example the messaging application described above may utilize sub bins such that a new sub bin is created periodically by the bin application. A new sub bin may be created for example after a user messaging session expires. A user messaging session expiration may be determined by for example the elapsing of a time quantum the sending of a certain number of messages and or the like. In high security configurations of the MBIN sub bins may be created for each discrete operation of a bin application. For example the secure messaging bin application may create a sub bin for every secure message sent. In so doing the MBIN may be conceptually thought of as providing bin object level encryption or any multiple of bin objects up to and including all objects in a given bin . Regardless of the binning strategy employed by a bin application the MBIN features discussed herein may be utilized by bins sub bins or any combination therein.

Although the bin application described above was described as utilizing the MBIN shared bin functionality to provide a secure channel between two device users of the MBIN alternate configurations of the MBIN may utilize a third party server or the MBIN itself as the recipient of shared bin objects. For example a bin application that transcodes media files between different file formats may create a bin that is paired with the provider of the bin application s servers. The MBIN would then synchronize any bin objects placed in the shared bin with the bin application provider s servers which would transcode the bin object and then reverse synchronize a new bin object from the output. Such a bidirectional synchronization capability combined with the MBIN s ability to allow bin applications to suppress or hide bins and define custom bin user interfaces as described herein allow the MBIN to provide a highly flexible platform for third party bin applications. In fact in some configurations the MBIN may itself act as a third party bin application provider. For example the MBIN may offer enhanced bin features such as bin object versioning enhanced bin object metadata and or the like by itself using the bin application platform described herein.

Bin server may additionally contain copies of the AES keys associated with shared bins whereby the AES keys have been encrypted with the public key of each shared user and or device e.g. . The public keys associated with users and or devices as well as document metadata that may reference unique object identifiers may be stored in a database in communication with bin server e.g. . In one embodiment encrypted bin objects may be stored in a server data store e.g. with a unique encrypted object identifier as the filename.

Typically users which may be people and or other systems may engage information technology systems e.g. computers to facilitate information processing. In turn computers employ processors to process information such processors may be referred to as central processing units CPU . One form of processor is referred to as a microprocessor.

These instructions may be operational and or data instructions containing and or referencing other instructions and data in various processor accessible and operable areas of memory e.g. registers cache memory random access memory etc. . Such communicative instructions may be stored and or transmitted in batches e.g. batches of instructions as programs and or data components to facilitate desired operations. These stored instruction codes e.g. programs may engage the CPU circuit components and other motherboard and or system components to perform desired operations. One type of program is a computer operating system which may be executed by CPU on a computer the operating system enables and facilitates users to access and operate computer information technology and resources.

In another embodiment the cryptographic processor and or transceivers may be connected as either internal and or external peripheral devices via the interface bus I O. In turn the transceivers may be connected to antenna s thereby effectuating wireless transmission and reception of various communication and or sensor protocols for example the antenna s may connect to a Texas Instruments WiLink WL1283 transceiver chip e.g. providing 802.1 in Bluetooth 3.0 FM global positioning system GPS thereby allowing MBIN controller to determine its location Broadcom BCM4329FKUBG transceiver chip e.g. providing 802.11n Bluetooth 2.1 EDR FM etc. a Broadcom BCM4750IUB8 receiver chip e.g. GPS an Infineon Technologies X Gold 618 PMB9800 e.g. providing 2G 3G HSDPA HSUPA communications and or the like. The system clock typically has a crystal oscillator and generates a base signal through the computer systemization s circuit pathways. The clock is typically coupled to the system bus and various clock multipliers that will increase or decrease the base operating frequency for other components interconnected in the computer systemization. The clock and various components in a computer systemization drive signals embodying information throughout the system. Such transmission and reception of instructions embodying information throughout a computer systemization may be commonly referred to as communications.

The CPU interacts with memory through instruction passing through conductive and or transportive conduits e.g. printed electronic and or optic circuits to execute stored instructions i.e. program code according to conventional data processing techniques. Such instruction passing facilitates communication within the MBIN controller and beyond through various interfaces. Should processing requirements dictate a greater amount speed and or capacity distributed processors e.g. Distributed MBIN mainframe multi core parallel and or super computer architectures may similarly be employed. Alternatively should deployment requirements dictate greater portability smaller Personal Digital Assistants PDAs may be employed.

Depending on the particular implementation features of the MBIN may be achieved by implementing a microcontroller such as CAST s R8051XC2 microcontroller Intel s MCS 51 i.e. 8051 microcontroller and or the like. Also to implement certain features of the MBIN some feature implementations may rely on embedded components such as Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC Digital Signal Processing DSP Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA and or the like embedded technology. For example any of the MBIN component collection distributed or otherwise and or features may be implemented via the microprocessor and or via embedded components e.g. via ASIC coprocessor DSP FPGA and or the like. Alternately some implementations of the MBIN may be implemented with embedded components that are configured and used to achieve a variety of features or signal processing.

Depending on the particular implementation the embedded components may include software solutions hardware solutions and or some combination of both hardware software solutions. For example MBIN features discussed herein may be achieved through implementing FPGAs which are a semiconductor devices containing programmable logic components called logic blocks and programmable interconnects such as the high performance FPGA Virtex series and or the low cost Spartan series manufactured by Xilinx. Logic blocks and interconnects can be programmed by the customer or designer after the FPGA is manufactured to implement any of the MBIN features. A hierarchy of programmable interconnects allow logic blocks to be interconnected as needed by the MBIN system designer administrator somewhat like a one chip programmable breadboard. An FPGA s logic blocks can be programmed to perform the operation of basic logic gates such as AND and XOR or more complex combinational operators such as decoders or mathematical operations. In most FPGAs the logic blocks also include memory elements which may be circuit flip flops or more complete blocks of memory. In some circumstances the MBIN may be developed on regular FPGAs and then migrated into a fixed version that more resembles ASIC implementations. Alternate or coordinating implementations may migrate MBIN controller features to a final ASIC instead of or in addition to FPGAs. Depending on the implementation all of the aforementioned embedded components and microprocessors may be considered the CPU and or processor for the MBIN.

Generally any mechanization and or embodiment allowing a processor to affect the storage and or retrieval of information is regarded as memory . However memory is a fungible technology and resource thus any number of memory embodiments may be employed in lieu of or in concert with one another. It is to be understood that the MBIN controller and or a computer systemization may employ various forms of memory . For example a computer systemization may be configured wherein the operation of on chip CPU memory e.g. registers RAM ROM and any other storage devices are provided by a paper punch tape or paper punch card mechanism however such an embodiment would result in an extremely slow rate of operation. In a typical configuration memory will include ROM RAM and a storage device . A storage device may be any conventional computer system storage. Storage devices may include a drum a fixed and or removable magnetic disk drive a magneto optical drive an optical drive i.e. Blueray CD ROM RAM Recordable R ReWritable RW DVD R RW HD DVD R RW etc. an array of devices e.g. Redundant Array of Independent Disks RAID solid state memory devices USB memory solid state drives SSD etc. other processor readable storage mediums and or other devices of the like. Thus a computer systemization generally requires and makes use of memory.

The memory may contain a collection of program and or database components and or data such as but not limited to operating system component information server component user interface component MBIN database component cryptographic server component BDSES Component BSR Component and or the like i.e. collectively a component collection . The aforementioned components may be incorporated into e.g. be sub components of loaded from loaded by or otherwise operatively available to and from the MBIN component s .

Any component may be stored and accessed from the storage devices and or from storage devices accessible through an interface bus. Although program components such as those in the component collection typically are stored in a local storage device they may also be loaded and or stored in other memory such as remote cloud storage facilities accessible through a communications network integrated ROM memory via an FPGA or ASIC implementing component logic and or the like.

The operating system component is an executable program component facilitating the operation of the MBIN controller. Typically the operating system facilitates access of I O network interfaces peripheral devices storage devices and or the like. The operating system may be a highly fault tolerant scalable and secure system such as Unix and Unix like system distributions such as AT T s UNIX Berkley Software Distribution BSD variations such as FreeBSD NetBSD OpenBSD and or the like Linux distributions such as Red Hat Debian Ubuntu and or the like and or the like operating systems. However more limited and or less secure operating systems also may be employed such as Apple OS X Microsoft Windows 2000 2003 3.1 95 98 CE Millenium NT Vista XP Win7 Server and or the like. An operating system may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or the like. Most frequently the operating system communicates with other program components user interfaces and or the like. The operating system once executed by the CPU may enable the interaction with communications networks data I O peripheral devices program components memory user input devices and or the like.

An information server component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The information server may be a conventional Internet information server such as but not limited to Apache Software Foundation s Apache Microsoft s Internet Information Server and or the like. The information server may allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as Active Server Page ASP ActiveX ANSI Objective C C and or .NET Common Gateway Interface CGI scripts dynamic D hypertext markup language HTML FLASH Java JavaScript Practical Extraction Report Language PERL Hypertext Pre Processor PHP pipes Python wireless application protocol WAP WebObjects and or the like. The information server may support secure communications protocols such as but not limited to File Transfer Protocol FTP HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTPS Secure Socket Layer SSL messaging protocols e.g. ICQ Internet Relay Chat IRC Presence and Instant Messaging Protocol PRIM Internet Engineering Task Force s IETF s Session Initiation Protocol SIP SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions SIMPLE open XML based Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol XMPP i.e. Jabber or Open Mobile Alliance s OMA s Instant Messaging and Presence Service IMPS Representational State Transfer REST and or the like. The information server provides results in the form of Web pages to Web browsers and allows for the manipulated generation of the Web pages through interaction with other program components. After a Domain Name System DNS resolution portion of an HTTP request is resolved to a particular information server the information server resolves requests for information at specified locations on the MBIN controller based on the remainder of the HTTP request. For example a request such as http 123.124.125.126 myInformation.html might have the IP portion of the request 123.124.125.126 resolved by a DNS server to an information server at that IP address that information server might in turn further parse the http request for the myInformation.html portion of the request and resolve it to a location in memory containing the information myInformation.html. Additionally other information serving protocols may be employed across various ports e.g. FTP communications across port 21 and or the like. An information server may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the information server communicates with the MBIN database component operating system component other program components user interfaces and or the like.

Access from the Information Server Component to the MBIN database component may be achieved through a number of database bridge mechanisms such as through scripting languages as enumerated below e.g. CGI and through inter application communication channels as enumerated below e.g. CORBA WebObjects etc. . Any data requests through a Web browser are parsed through the bridge mechanism into appropriate grammars as required by the MBIN. In one embodiment the information server would provide a Web form accessible by a Web browser. Entries made into supplied fields in the Web form are tagged as having been entered into the particular fields and parsed as such. The entered terms are then passed along with the field tags which act to instruct the parser to generate queries directed to appropriate tables and or fields. In one embodiment the parser may generate queries in standard SQL by instantiating a search string with the proper join select commands based on the tagged text entries wherein the resulting command is provided over the bridge mechanism to the MBIN as a query. Upon generating query results from the query the results are passed over the bridge mechanism and may be parsed for formatting and generation of a new results Web page by the bridge mechanism. Such a new results Web page is then provided to the information server which may supply it to the requesting Web browser. Also an information server may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests and or responses.

Computer interfaces in some respects are similar to automobile operation interfaces. Automobile operation interface elements such as steering wheels gearshifts and speedometers facilitate the access operation and display of automobile resources and status. Computer interaction interface elements such as check boxes cursors menus scrollers and windows collectively and commonly referred to as widgets similarly facilitate the access capabilities operation and display of data and computer hardware and operating system resources and status. Operation interfaces are commonly called user interfaces. Graphical user interfaces GUIs such as the Apple Macintosh Operating System s Aqua IBM s OS 2 Microsoft s Windows 2000 2003 3.1 95 98 CE Millenium NT XP Vista 7 i.e. Aero Unix s X Windows web interface libraries such as but not limited to Dojo jQuery UI MooTools Prototype script.aculo.us SWFObject Yahoo User Interface any of which may be used and provide a baseline and means of accessing and displaying information graphically to users.

A cryptographic server component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU cryptographic processor cryptographic processor interface cryptographic processor device and or the like. Cryptographic processor interfaces will allow for expedition of encryption and or decryption requests by the cryptographic component however the cryptographic component alternatively may run on a conventional CPU. The cryptographic component allows for the encryption and or decryption of provided data. The cryptographic component allows for both symmetric and asymmetric e.g. Pretty Good Protection PGP encryption and or decryption. The cryptographic component may employ cryptographic techniques such as but not limited to digital certificates e.g. X.509 authentication framework digital signatures dual signatures enveloping password access protection public key management and or the like. The cryptographic component will facilitate numerous encryption and or decryption security protocols such as but not limited to checksum Data Encryption Standard DES Elliptical Curve Encryption ECC International Data Encryption Algorithm IDEA Message Digest 5 MD5 which is a one way hash operation passwords Rivest Cipher RC5 Rijndael AES RSA Secure Hash Algorithm SHA Secure Socket Layer SSL Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTPS and or the like. Employing such encryption security protocols the MBIN may encrypt all incoming and or outgoing communications and may serve as node within a virtual private network VPN with a wider communications network. The cryptographic component facilitates the process of security authorization whereby access to a resource is inhibited by a security protocol wherein the cryptographic component effects authorized access to the secured resource. In addition the cryptographic component may provide unique identifiers of content e.g. employing and MD5 hash to obtain a unique signature for an digital audio file. A cryptographic component may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. The cryptographic component supports encryption schemes allowing for the secure transmission of information across a communications network to enable the MBIN component to engage in secure transactions if so desired. The cryptographic component facilitates the secure accessing of resources on the MBIN and facilitates the access of secured resources on remote systems i.e. it may act as a client and or server of secured resources. Most frequently the cryptographic component communicates with information server component operating system component other program components and or the like. The cryptographic component may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests and or responses.

The MBIN database component may be embodied in a database and its stored data. The database is a stored program component which is executed by the CPU the stored program component portion configuring the CPU to process the stored data. The database may be a conventional fault tolerant relational scalable secure database such as Oracle or Sybase. Relational databases are an extension of a flat file. Relational databases consist of a series of related tables. The tables are interconnected via a key field. Use of the key field allows the combination of the tables by indexing against the key field i.e. the key fields act as dimensional pivot points for combining information from various tables. Relationships generally identify links maintained between tables by matching primary keys. Primary keys represent fields that uniquely identify the rows of a table in a relational database. More precisely they uniquely identify rows of a table on the one side of a one to many relationship.

Alternatively the MBIN database may be implemented using various standard data structures such as an array hash linked list struct structured text file e.g. XML table and or the like. Such data structures may be stored in memory and or in structured files. In another alternative an object oriented database may be used such as Frontier ObjectStore Poet Zope and or the like. Object databases can include a number of object collections that are grouped and or linked together by common attributes they may be related to other object collections by some common attributes. Object oriented databases perform similarly to relational databases with the exception that objects are not just pieces of data but may have other types of capabilities encapsulated within a given object. Also the database may be implemented as a mix of data structures objects and relational structures. Databases may be consolidated and or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing techniques. Portions of databases e.g. tables may be exported and or imported and thus decentralized and or integrated.

In one embodiment the database component includes several tables . A Users table may include fields such as but not limited to user id ssn dob first name last name age state address firstline address secondline zipcode devices list contact info contact type alt contact info alt contact type and or the like. A Clients table may include fields such as but not limited to client id client name client ip client type client model operating system os version app installed flag and or the like. A Bins table may include fields such as but not limited to bin id bin name bin owner user id bin shared user id array bin storage limits bin template bin created date bin expiration date bin max objects bin applications installed and or the like. A Bin Permissions table may include fields such as but not limited to bin permission id bin id user id permission type permission description permission command permission value and or the like.

Any of the aforementioned tables may support and or track multiple entities accounts users and or the like.

In one embodiment the MBIN database component may interact with other database systems. For example when employing a distributed database system. In such an embodiment queries and data access by any MBIN component may treat the combination of the MBIN database component results and results from a second segment in a distributed database system as an integrated database layer. Such a database layer may be accessed as a single database entity for example through MBIN database component by any MBIN component.

In one embodiment user programs may contain various user interface primitives which may serve to update the MBIN. Also various accounts may require custom database tables depending upon the environments and the types of clients the MBIN may need to serve. It should be noted that any unique fields may be designated as a key field throughout. In an alternative embodiment these tables have been decentralized into their own databases and their respective database controllers i.e. individual database controllers for each of the above tables . Employing standard data processing techniques one may further distribute the databases over several computer systemizations and or storage devices. Similarly configurations of the decentralized database controllers may be varied by consolidating and or distributing the various database components . The MBIN may be configured to keep track of various settings inputs and parameters via database controllers.

The MBIN database may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the MBIN database communicates with the MBIN component other program components and or the like. The database may contain retain and provide information regarding other nodes and data.

The MBIN component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. In one embodiment the MBIN component incorporates any and or all combinations of the aspects of the MBIN that was discussed in the previous figures. As such the MBIN affects accessing obtaining and the provision of information services transactions and or the like across various communications networks. The features and embodiments of the MBIN discussed herein increase network efficiency by reducing data transfer requirements the use of more efficient data structures and mechanisms for their transfer and storage. As a consequence more data may be transferred in less time and latencies with regard to data processing operations and transactions are also reduced. In many cases such reduction in storage transfer time bandwidth requirements latencies etc. will reduce the capacity and structural infrastructure requirements to support the MBIN s features and facilities and in many cases reduce the costs energy consumption requirements and extend the life of MBIN s underlying infrastructure this has the added benefit of making the MBIN more reliable. Similarly many of the features and mechanisms are designed to be easier for users to use and access thereby broadening the audience that may enjoy employ and exploit the feature sets of the MBIN such ease of use also helps to increase the reliability of the MBIN. In addition the feature sets include heightened security as noted via the Cryptographic components and throughout making access to the features and data more reliable and secure.

The MBIN component may transform unencrypted objects and or the like into secure bin enabled objects and or the like and use the MBIN. In one embodiment the MBIN component takes inputs e.g. create secure storage input secure storage setup request user secure object store login request secure object store login request bin creation input bin creation request bin object storage request bin storage request bin object retrieval request bin object retrieval request encrypted bin application setup definition bin application input and or the like etc. and transforms the inputs via various components e.g. BDSES Component BSR Component and or the like into outputs e.g. device linked API certificate public key API certificate and encrypted private key encrypted binkey storage request encrypted binkey and bin metadata encrypted object storage response encrypted object retrieval response application bin object storage request bin application output and or the like .

The MBIN component enabling access of information between nodes may be developed by employing standard development tools and languages such as but not limited to Apache components Assembly ActiveX binary executables ANSI Objective C C and or .NET database adapters CGI scripts Java JavaScript mapping tools procedural and object oriented development tools PERL PHP Python shell scripts SQL commands web application server extensions web development environments and libraries e.g. Microsoft s ActiveX Adobe AIR FLEX FLASH AJAX D HTML Dojo Java JavaScript jQuery jQuery UI MooTools Prototype script.aculo.us Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP SWFObject Yahoo User Interface and or the like WebObjects and or the like. In one embodiment the MBIN server employs a cryptographic server to encrypt and decrypt communications. The MBIN component may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the MBIN component communicates with the MBIN database component operating system component other program components and or the like. The MBIN may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests and or responses.

The structure and or operation of any of the MBIN node controller components may be combined consolidated and or distributed in any number of ways to facilitate development and or deployment. Similarly the component collection may be combined in any number of ways to facilitate deployment and or development. To accomplish this one may integrate the components into a common code base or in a facility that can dynamically load the components on demand in an integrated fashion.

The component collection may be consolidated and or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing and or development techniques. Multiple instances of any one of the program components in the program component collection may be instantiated on a single node and or across numerous nodes to improve performance through load balancing and or data processing techniques. Furthermore single instances may also be distributed across multiple controllers and or storage devices e.g. databases. All program component instances and controllers working in concert may do so through standard data processing communication techniques.

The configuration of the MBIN controller will depend on the context of system deployment. Factors such as but not limited to the budget capacity location and or use of the underlying hardware resources may affect deployment requirements and configuration. Regardless of if the configuration results in more consolidated and or integrated program components results in a more distributed series of program components and or results in some combination between a consolidated and distributed configuration data may be communicated obtained and or provided. Instances of components consolidated into a common code base from the program component collection may communicate obtain and or provide data. This may be accomplished through intra application data processing communication techniques such as but not limited to data referencing e.g. pointers internal messaging object instance variable communication shared memory space variable passing and or the like.

If component collection components are discrete separate and or external to one another then communicating obtaining and or providing data with and or to other component components may be accomplished through inter application data processing communication techniques such as but not limited to Application Program Interfaces API information passage distributed Component Object Model D COM Distributed Object Linking and Embedding D OLE and or the like Common Object Request Broker Architecture CORBA Jini local and remote application program interfaces JavaScript Object Notation JSON Remote Method Invocation RMI SOAP Representational State Transfer REST process pipes shared files and or the like. Messages sent between discrete component components for inter application communication or within memory spaces of a singular component for intra application communication may be facilitated through the creation and parsing of a grammar. A grammar may be developed by using development tools such as lex yacc XML and or the like which allow for grammar generation and parsing capabilities which in turn may form the basis of communication messages within and between components.

where Value1 is discerned as being a parameter because http is part of the grammar syntax and what follows is considered part of the post value. Similarly with such a grammar a variable Value1 may be inserted into an http post command and then sent. The grammar syntax itself may be presented as structured data that is interpreted and or otherwise used to generate the parsing mechanism e.g. a syntax description text file as processed by lex yacc etc. . Also once the parsing mechanism is generated and or instantiated it itself may process and or parse structured data such as but not limited to character e.g. tab delineated text HTML structured text streams XML and or the like structured data. Further the parsing grammar may be used beyond message parsing but may also be used to parse databases data collections data stores structured data and or the like. Again the desired configuration will depend upon the context environment and requirements of system deployment.
