Platinum anticancer agents in the clinic today are potent and efficacious however they cause a large number of serious adverse effects because their activity is often not targeted at the cancer but rather at all body tissues with the cancerous tissue being included. This invention addresses these and other needs in the art. For example provided herein is a means to channel the activity of a platinum anticancer agent to a cancerous tissue thereby decreasing the potential of adverse effects.

Cancer is the second leading cause of death behind heart disease. In fact cancer incidence and death figures account for about 10 of the U.S. population in certain areas of the United States National Cancer Institute s Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER database and Bureau of the Census statistics see Kasper et al. 16ed. 2005 Chapter 66 . The five leading causes of cancer deaths among men are lung cancer prostate cancer colon and rectum cancer pancreatic cancer and leukemia. The five leading causes of cancer deaths among women are lung cancer breast cancer colon cancer ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer. When detected at locally advanced or metastatic stages no consistently curative treatment regimen exists. Treatment for metastatic cancer includes immunotherapy hormonal ablation radiation therapy chemotherapy hormonal therapy and combination therapies. Unfortunately for prostate cancer and hormone dependent tumors there is frequent relapse of an aggressive androgen independent disease that is insensitive to further hormonal manipulation or to treatment with conventional chemotherapy Ghosh et al. 95 13182 13187 1998 .

The organic cation transporters OCTs OCT1 Grundemann et al. 372 549 552 1994 OCT2 Okuda et al. 224 500 507 1996 and OCT3 Kekuda et al. 273 15971 15979 1998 Wu et al. 273 32776 32786 1998 are in the class of plasma membrane transporters belonging to the solute carrier SLC 22A family. The OCTs mediate intracellular uptake of a broad range of structurally diverse organic cations Jonker et al. 308 2 9 2004 Wright 204 309 319 2005 . Substrates of OCTs include endogenous compounds such as choline creatinine and monoamine neurotransmitters and a variety of xenobiotics such as tetraethylammonium TEA a prototypic organic cation 1 methyl 4 phenylpyridinium MPP a neurotoxin and clinically used drugs such as metformin cimetidine and amantadine Jonker et al. supra . In humans OCT1 is primarily expressed in the liver Gorboulev et al. 16 871 881 1997 Zhang et al. 51 913 921 1997 Wright supra and less so in the intestine Muller et al. 70 1851 1860 2005 whereas OCT2 is predominantly expressed in the kidney Gorboulev et al. supra Wright supra . OCT3 is expressed in many tissues including placenta heart liver and skeletal muscle Grundemann et al. 1 349 351 1998 Verhaagh et al. 55 209 218 1999 . The expression of the OCTs has also been detected in a number of human cancer cell lines Hayer Zillgen et al. 136 829 836 2002 . The interaction of cisplatin with human OCTs has been investigated and the results are discordant Briz et al. 61 853 860 2002 Ciarimboli et al. 167 1477 1484 2005 . Previous studies indicate that cisplatin is not a substrate of human OCT1 or OCT2 Briz et al. supra whereas more recent work indicates that the drug interacts with human and rat OCT2 but not OCT1 Ciarimboli et al. supra Yonezawa et al. 70 1823 1831 2005 .

Platinum based compounds and drugs are among the most active anticancer agents and cisplatin represents one of the three most widely used cancer chemotherapeutics Wong et al. 99 2451 2466 1999 . Although cisplatin is effective against a number of solid tumors especially testicular and ovarian cancer its clinical use is limited because of its toxic effects as well as the intrinsic and acquired resistance of some tumors to this drug Weiss et al. 46 360 377 1993 . Carboplatin is less nephrotoxic but its cross resistance with cisplatin limits its application in otherwise cisplatin treatable diseases Weiss et al. supra . Oxaliplatin however exhibits a different anticancer spectrum from that of cisplatin Raymond et al. 9 1053 1071 1998 Rixe et al. 52 1855 1865 1996 . It has been approved as the first or second line therapy in combination with 5 fluoruracil leucovorin for advanced colorectal cancer for which cisplatin and carboplatin are essentially inactive Misset et al. 35 75 93 2000 . In spite of their distinct antitumor specificities cisplatin and oxaliplatin exhibit cytotoxicity Pinto et al. 780 167 180 1985 Zamble et al. 20 435 439 1995 . These compounds may initiate a series of biochemical cascades eventually leading to cell death Pinto et al. supra Wang et al. 4 307 320 2005 .

Cisplatin and oxaliplatin target similar DNA sites for binding and form similar types of DNA adducts Jennerwein et al. 70 39 49 1989 Page et al. 29 1016 1024 1990 Woynarowski et al. 54 770 777 1998 mainly 1 2 and 1 3 intrastrand cross links involving purine nucleotides. Studies aiming to identify such mechanisms have focused on the cellular processing of cisplatin and oxaliplatin DNA adducts Chaney et al. 53 3 11 2005 Vaisman et al. 38 11026 11039 1999 . Reduced intracellular accumulation is a common observation in cisplatin resistant cells Andrews et al. 2 35 43 1990 Gately et al. 67 1171 1176 1993 .

The abbreviations used herein have their conventional meaning within the chemical and biological arts. The chemical structures and formulae set forth herein are constructed according to the standard rules of chemical valency known in the chemical arts.

Where substituent groups are specified by their conventional chemical formulae written from left to right they equally encompass the chemically identical substituents that would result from writing the structure from right to left e.g. CHO is equivalent to OCH .

The term alkyl by itself or as part of another substituent means unless otherwise stated a straight i.e. unbranched or branched carbon chain or carbon or combination thereof which may be fully saturated mono or polyunsaturated and can include di and multivalent radicals having the number of carbon atoms designated i.e. C Cmeans one to ten carbons . Examples of saturated hydrocarbon radicals include but are not limited to groups such as methyl ethyl n propyl isopropyl n butyl t butyl isobutyl sec butyl cyclohexyl methyl homologs and isomers of for example n pentyl n hexyl n heptyl n octyl and the like. An unsaturated alkyl group is one having one or more double bonds or triple bonds. Examples of unsaturated alkyl groups include but are not limited to vinyl 2 propenyl crotyl 2 isopentenyl 2 butadienyl 2 4 pentadienyl 3 1 4 pentadienyl ethynyl 1 and 3 propynyl 3 butynyl and the higher homologs and isomers. An alkoxy is an alkyl attached to the remainder of the molecule via an oxygen linker O .

The term alkylene by itself or as part of another substituent means unless otherwise stated a divalent radical derived from an alkyl as exemplified but not limited by CHCHCHCH . Typically an alkyl or alkylene group will have from 1 to 24 carbon atoms with those groups having 10 or fewer carbon atoms being preferred in the present invention. A lower alkyl or lower alkylene is a shorter chain alkyl or alkylene group generally having eight or fewer carbon atoms. The term alkenylene by itself or as part of another substituent means unless otherwise stated a divalent radical derived from an alkene.

The term heteroalkyl by itself or in combination with another term means unless otherwise stated a stable straight or branched chain or combinations thereof including at least one carbon atom and at least one heteroatom selected from the group consisting of Pt O N P Si and S and wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized. The heteroatom s Pt O N P S and Si may be placed at any interior position of the heteroalkyl group or at the position at which the alkyl group is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples include but are not limited to CH CH O CH CH CH NH CH CH CH N CH CH CH S CH CH CH CH S O CH CH CH S O CH CH CH O CH Si CH CH CH N OCH CH CH N CH CH O CH O CH CH and CN. Up to two or three heteroatoms may be consecutive such as for example CH NH OCHand CH O Si CH .

Similarly the term heteroalkylene by itself or as part of another substituent means unless otherwise stated a divalent radical derived from heteroalkyl as exemplified but not limited by CH CH S CH CH and CH S CH CH NH CH . For heteroalkylene groups heteroatoms can also occupy either or both of the chain termini e.g. alkyleneoxy alkylenedioxy alkyleneamino alkylenediamino and the like . Still further for alkylene and heteroalkylene linking groups no orientation of the linking group is implied by the direction in which the formula of the linking group is written. For example the formula C O R represents both C O R and R C O . As described above heteroalkyl groups as used herein include those groups that are attached to the remainder of the molecule through a heteroatom such as C O R C O NR NR R OR SR and or SOR . Where heteroalkyl is recited followed by recitations of specific heteroalkyl groups such as NR R or the like it will be understood that the terms heteroalkyl and NR R are not redundant or mutually exclusive. Rather the specific heteroalkyl groups are recited to add clarity. Thus the term heteroalkyl should not be interpreted herein as excluding specific heteroalkyl groups such as NR R or the like.

The terms cycloalkyl and heterocycloalkyl by themselves or in combination with other terms mean unless otherwise stated cyclic versions of alkyl and heteroalkyl respectively. Additionally for heterocycloalkyl a heteroatom can occupy the position at which the heterocycle is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples of cycloalkyl include but are not limited to cyclopropyl cyclobutyl cyclopentyl cyclohexyl 1 cyclohexenyl 3 cyclohexenyl cycloheptyl and the like. Examples of heterocycloalkyl include but are not limited to 1 1 2 5 6 tetrahydropyridyl 1 piperidinyl 2 piperidinyl 3 piperidinyl 4 morpholinyl 3 morpholinyl tetrahydrofuran 2 yl tetrahydrofuran 3 yl tetrahydrothien 2 yl tetrahydrothien 3 yl 1 piperazinyl 2 piperazinyl and the like. A cycloalkylene and a heterocycloalkylene alone or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from a cycloalkyl and heterocycloalkyl respectively.

The terms halo or halogen by themselves or as part of another substituent mean unless otherwise stated a fluorine chlorine bromine or iodine atom. Additionally terms such as haloalkyl are meant to include monohaloalkyl and polyhaloalkyl. For example the term halo C C alkyl includes but is not limited to fluoromethyl difluoromethyl trifluoromethyl 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl 4 chlorobutyl 3 bromopropyl and the like.

The term acyl means unless otherwise stated C O R where R is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl substituted or unsubstituted aryl or substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl.

The term aryl means unless otherwise stated a polyunsaturated aromatic hydrocarbon substituent which can be a single ring or multiple rings preferably from 1 to 3 rings that are fused together i.e. a fused ring aryl or linked covalently. A fused ring aryl refers to multiple rings fused together wherein at least one of the fused rings is an aryl ring. The term heteroaryl refers to aryl groups or rings that contain at least one heteroatom such as Pt N O or S wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms are optionally oxidized and the nitrogen atom s are optionally quaternized. Thus the term heteroaryl includes fused ring heteroaryl groups i.e. multiple rings fused together wherein at least one of the fused rings is a heteroaromatic ring . A 5 6 fused ring heteroaryl refers to two rings fused together wherein one ring has 5 members and the other ring has 6 members and wherein at least one ring is a heteroaryl ring. Likewise a 6 6 fused ring heteroaryl refers to two rings fused together wherein one ring has 6 members and the other ring has 6 members and wherein at least one ring is a heteroaryl ring. And a 6 5 fused ring heteroaryl refers to two rings fused together wherein one ring has 6 members and the other ring has 5 members and wherein at least one ring is a heteroaryl ring. A heteroaryl group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule through a carbon or heteroatom. Non limiting examples of aryl and heteroaryl groups include phenyl 1 naphthyl 2 naphthyl 4 biphenyl 1 pyrrolyl 2 pyrrolyl 3 pyrrolyl 3 pyrazolyl 2 imidazolyl 4 imidazolyl pyrazinyl 2 oxazolyl 4 oxazolyl 2 phenyl 4 oxazolyl 5 oxazolyl 3 isoxazolyl 4 isoxazolyl 5 isoxazolyl 2 thiazolyl 4 thiazolyl 5 thiazolyl 2 furyl 3 furyl 2 thienyl 3 thienyl 2 pyridyl 3 pyridyl 4 pyridyl 2 pyrimidyl 4 pyrimidyl 5 benzothiazolyl purinyl 2 benzimidazolyl 5 indolyl 1 isoquinolyl 5 isoquinolyl 2 quinoxalinyl 5 quinoxalinyl 3 quinolyl and 6 quinolyl. Substituents for each of the above noted aryl and heteroaryl ring systems are selected from the group of acceptable substituents described below. An arylene and a heteroarylene alone or as part of another substituent mean a divalent radical derived from an aryl and heteroaryl respectively.

A fused ring heterocyloalkyl aryl is an aryl fused to a heterocycloalkyl. A fused ring heterocycloalkyl heteroaryl is a heteroaryl fused to a heterocycloalkyl. A fused ring heterocycloalkyl cycloalkyl is a heterocycloalkyl fused to a cycloalkyl. A fused ring heterocycloalkyl heterocycloalkyl is a heterocycloalkyl fused to another heterocycloalkyl. Fused ring heterocycloalkyl aryl fused ring heterocycloalkyl heteroaryl fused ring heterocycloalkyl cycloalkyl or fused ring heterocycloalkyl heterocycloalkyl may each independently be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more of the substitutents described herein.

The term alkylsulfonyl as used herein means a moiety having the formula S O R where R is an alkyl group as defined above including substituted or unsubstituted. R may have a specified number of carbons e.g. C Calkylsulfonyl .

Each of the above terms e.g. alkyl heteroalkyl aryl and heteroaryl includes both substituted and unsubstituted forms of the indicated radical. Preferred substituents for each type of radical are provided below.

Substituents for the alkyl and heteroalkyl radicals including those groups often referred to as alkylene alkenyl heteroalkylene heteroalkenyl alkynyl cycloalkyl heterocycloalkyl cycloalkenyl and heterocycloalkenyl can be one or more of a variety of groups selected from but not limited to OR O NR N OR NR R SR halogen SiR R R OC O R C O R COR CONR R OC O NR R NR C O R NR C O NR R NR C O R NR C NR R R NR NR C NR R NR S O R S O R S O NR R NRSOR NR NR R ONR R NR C O NR NR R CN NO in a number ranging from zero to 2 m 1 where m is the total number of carbon atoms in such radical. R R R R and R each preferably independently refer to hydrogen substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl substituted or unsubstituted aryl e.g. aryl substituted with 1 3 halogens substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl substituted or unsubstituted alkyl alkoxy or thioalkoxy groups or arylalkyl groups. When a compound of the invention includes more than one R group for example each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R R R and R group when more than one of these groups is present. When R and R are attached to the same nitrogen atom they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 4 5 6 or 7 membered ring. For example NR R includes but is not limited to 1 pyrrolidinyl and 4 morpholinyl. From the above discussion of substituents one of skill in the art will understand that the term alkyl is meant to include groups including carbon atoms bound to groups other than hydrogen groups such as haloalkyl e.g. CFand CHCF and acyl e.g. C O CH C O CF C O CHOCH and the like .

Similar to the substituents described for the alkyl radical substituents for the aryl and heteroaryl groups are varied and are selected from for example OR NR R SR halogen SiR R R OC O R C O R COR CONR R OC O NR R NR C O R NR C O NR R NR C O R NR C NR R R NR NR C NR R NR S O R S O R S O NR R NRSOR NR NR R ONR R NR C O NR NR R CN NO R N CH Ph fluoro C C alkoxy and fluoro C C alkyl in a number ranging from zero to the total number of open valences on the aromatic ring system and where R R R and R are preferably independently selected from hydrogen substituted or unsubstituted alkyl substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl substituted or unsubstituted aryl and substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl. When a compound of the invention includes more than one R group for example each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R R R and R groups when more than one of these groups is present.

Two or more substituents may optionally be joined to form aryl heteroaryl cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl groups. Such so called ring forming substituents are typically though not necessarily found attached to a cyclic base structure. In one embodiment the ring forming substituents are attached to adjacent members of the base structure. For example two ring forming substituents attached to adjacent members of a cyclic base structure create a fused ring structure. In another embodiment the ring forming substituents are attached to a single member of the base structure. For example two ring forming substituents attached to a single member of a cyclic base structure create a spirocyclic structure. In yet another embodiment the ring forming substituents are attached to non adjacent members of the base structure.

Two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally form a ring of the formula T C O CRR U wherein T and U are independently NR O CRR or a single bond and q is an integer of from 0 to 3. Alternatively two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula A CH B wherein A and B are independently CRR O NR S S O S O S O NR or a single bond and r is an integer of from 1 to 4. One of the single bonds of the new ring so formed may optionally be replaced with a double bond. Alternatively two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula CRR X C R R where s and d are independently integers of from 0 to 3 and X is O NR S S O S O or S O NR . The substituents R R R and R are preferably independently selected from hydrogen substituted or unsubstituted alkyl substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl substituted or unsubstituted aryl and substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl.

Expression therefore refers to both expression of OCT or NET protein and RNA as well as local overexpression due to altered protein trafficking patterns and or augmented functional activity. Expression can be detected using conventional techniques for detecting protein e.g. ELISA Western blotting flow cytometry immunofluorescence immunohistochemistry etc. or mRNA e.g. RT PCR PCR hybridization etc. . One skilled in the art will know of other techniques suitable for detecting expression of OCT or NET protein or mRNA. Cancerous cells e.g. cancerous colon or liver cells or kidney cells or neuroendocrine cells in the case of NET can express e.g. overexpress one or more OCTs e.g. OCT1 OCT2 and or OCT3 or NET at a level of at least about 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 or 95 in comparison to normal non cancerous cells such as colon or liver cells or neuroendocrine cells in the case of NET. Cancerous cells can also have at least about a 1 fold 2 fold 3 fold 4 fold 5 fold 6 fold or 7 fold higher level of OCT or NET transcription or translation in comparison to normal non cancerous cells. In certain instances the cancer cell sample is autologous.

 Therapy resistant cancers tumor cells and tumors refer to cancers that have become resistant to both apoptosis mediated e.g. through death receptor cell signaling for example Fas ligand receptor TRAIL receptors TNF R1 chemotherapeutic drugs radiation etc. and non apoptosis mediated e.g. toxic drugs chemicals etc. cancer therapies including but not limited to chemotherapy hormonal therapy radiotherapy immunotherapy and combinations thereof.

As used herein the term marker refers to any biochemical marker serological marker genetic marker or other clinical or echographic characteristic that can be used to diagnose or provide a prognosis for a cancer that expresses at least one OCT or NET according to the methods of the present invention. Preferably the marker is an OCT or NET protein or nucleic acid marker such as a NET marker or an OCT1 OCT2 and or OCT3 marker.

The term sample includes sections of tissues such as biopsy and autopsy samples and frozen sections taken for histological purposes. Such samples include blood and blood fractions or products e.g. serum plasma platelets red blood cells and the like sputum tissue cultured cells e.g. primary cultures explants and transformed cells stool urine other biological fluids e.g. prostatic fluid gastric fluid intestinal fluid renal fluid lung fluid cerebrospinal fluid and the like etc. A sample is typically obtained from a subject such as a eukaryotic organism most preferably a mammal such as a primate e.g. chimpanzee or human cow dog cat a rodent e.g. guinea pig rat mouse rabbit or a bird reptile or fish. In some embodiments the sample is obtained from a human.

A biopsy refers to the process of removing a tissue sample for diagnostic or prognostic evaluation and to the tissue specimen itself. Any biopsy technique known in the art can be applied to the diagnostic and prognostic methods of the present invention. The biopsy technique applied will depend on the tissue type to be evaluated e.g. colon prostate kidney bladder lymph node liver bone marrow blood cell etc. the size and type of the tumor e.g. solid or suspended blood or ascites among other factors. Representative biopsy techniques include but are not limited to excisional biopsy incisional biopsy needle biopsy surgical biopsy and bone marrow biopsy. An excisional biopsy refers to the removal of an entire tumor mass with a small margin of normal tissue surrounding it. An incisional biopsy refers to the removal of a wedge of tissue that includes a cross sectional diameter of the tumor. A diagnosis or prognosis made by endoscopy or fluoroscopy can require a core needle biopsy of the tumor mass or a fine needle aspiration biopsy which generally obtains a suspension of cells from within the tumor mass. Biopsy techniques are discussed for example in Kasper et al. eds. 16th ed. 2005 Chapter 70 and throughout Part V.

The terms identical or percent identity in the context of two or more nucleic acids or polypeptide sequences refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a specified percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides that are the same e.g. about 60 identity preferably about 65 70 75 80 85 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 or higher identity over a specified region when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence over a comparison window or designated region as measured using a BLAST or BLAST 2.0 sequence comparison algorithm with default parameters described below or by manual alignment and visual inspection see e.g. NCBI web site http www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov BLAST or the like . Such sequences are then said to be substantially identical. This definition also refers to or may be applied to the complement of a test sequence. The definition also includes sequences that have deletions and or additions as well as those that have substitutions. As described below the preferred algorithms can account for gaps and the like. Preferably identity exists over a region that is at least about 25 amino acids or nucleotides in length or over a region that is about 50 100 amino acids or nucleotides in length.

A comparison window as used herein includes reference to a segment of any one of the number of contiguous positions selected from the group consisting of from about 20 to about 600 usually from about 50 to about 200 more usually from about 100 to about 150 in which a sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of the same number of contiguous positions after the two sequences are optimally aligned. Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well known in the art. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted e.g. by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman 2 482 1981 by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch 48 443 1970 by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman 85 2444 1988 by computerized implementations of these algorithms GAP BESTFIT FASTA and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Genetics Computer Group 575 Science Dr. Madison Wis. or by manual alignment and visual inspection see e.g. Ausubel et al. eds. 1987 2005 Wiley Interscience .

For sequence comparison typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm test and reference sequences are entered into a computer subsequence coordinates are designated if necessary and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. Preferably default program parameters can be used or alternative parameters can be designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identities for the test sequences relative to the reference sequence based on the program parameters.

A preferred example of algorithms suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity are the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms which are described in Altschul et al. 25 3389 3402 1977 and Altschul et al. 215 403 410 1990 respectively. BLAST and BLAST 2.0 are used with the parameters described herein to determine percent sequence identity for the nucleic acids and proteins of the present invention. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information http www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov . This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs HSPs by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence which either match or satisfy some positive valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold Altschul et al. supra . These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using for nucleotide sequences the parameters M reward score for a pair of matching residues always 0 and N penalty score for mismatching residues always 

 Nucleic acid refers to deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single or double stranded form and complements thereof. The term encompasses nucleic acids containing known nucleotide analogs or modified backbone residues or linkages which are synthetic naturally occurring or non naturally occurring which have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid or which are metabolized in a manner similar to the reference nucleotides. Examples of such analogs include without limitation phosphorothioates phosphoramidates methyl phosphonates chiral methyl phosphonates 2 O methyl ribonucleotides and peptide nucleic acids PNAs .

Unless otherwise indicated a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof e.g. degenerate codon substitutions and complementary sequences as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. Specifically degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected or all codons is substituted with mixed base and or deoxyinosine residues Batzer et al. 19 5081 1991 Ohtsuka et al. 260 2605 2608 1985 Rossolini et al. 8 91 98 1994 . In some embodiments a nucleic acid is a gene cDNA mRNA oligonucleotide or polynucleotide.

A particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses splice variants and nucleic acid sequences encoding truncated forms of OCT or NET. Similarly a particular protein encoded by a nucleic acid implicitly encompasses any protein encoded by a splice variant or truncated form of that nucleic acid. Splice variants as the name suggests are products of alternative splicing of a gene. After transcription an initial nucleic acid transcript may be spliced such that different alternate nucleic acid splice products encode different polypeptides. Mechanisms for the production of splice variants vary but include alternate splicing of exons. Alternate polypeptides derived from the same nucleic acid by read through transcription are also encompassed by this definition. Any products of a splicing reaction including recombinant forms of the splice products are included in this definition. Nucleic acids can be truncated at the 5 end or at the 3 end. Polypeptides can be truncated at the N terminal end or the C terminal end. Truncated versions of nucleic acid or polypeptide sequences can be naturally occurring or recombinantly created.

 Polymorphism refers to the occurrence of two or more genetically determined alternative sequences or alleles in a population e.g. NET OCT1 OCT2 or OCT3 alleles . A polymorphic site refers to the locus at which divergence occurs. Preferred polymorphic sites have at least two alleles each occurring at frequency of greater than 1 and more preferably greater than 10 or 20 of a selected population. A polymorphic locus can be as small as one base pair single nucleotide polymorphism or SNP . Polymorphic markers include restriction fragment length polymorphisms variable number of tandem repeats VNTR s hypervariable regions minisatellites dinucleotide repeats trinucleotide repeats tetranucleotide repeats simple sequence repeats and insertion elements such as Alu. The first identified allele is arbitrarily designated as the reference allele and other alleles are designated as alternative or variant alleles. The allele occurring most frequently in a selected population is sometimes referred to as the wild type allele. Diploid organisms may be homozygous or heterozygous for the variant alleles. The variant allele may or may not produce an observable physical or biochemical characteristic phenotype in an individual carrying the variant allele. For example a variant allele may alter the enzymatic activity of a protein encoded by a gene of interest.

The term genotype as used herein broadly refers to the genetic composition of an organism including for example whether a diploid organism is heterozygous or homozygous for one or more variant alleles of interest.

The term gene amplification refers to a cellular process characterized by the production of multiple copies of any particular piece of DNA. For example a tumor cell amplifies or copies chromosomal segments naturally as a result of cell signals and sometimes environmental events. The process of gene amplification leads to the production of many copies of the genes that are located on that region of the chromosome. In certain instances so many copies of the amplified region are produced that they can form their own small pseudo chromosomes called double minute chromosomes. The genes on each of the copies can be transcribed and translated leading to an overproduction of the mRNA and protein corresponding to the amplified genes.

The terms polypeptide peptide and protein are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The terms apply to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residue is an artificial chemical mimetic of a corresponding naturally occurring amino acid as well as to naturally occurring amino acid polymers and non naturally occurring amino acid polymers.

The term amino acid refers to naturally occurring and synthetic amino acids as well as amino acid analogs and amino acid mimetics that function in a manner similar to the naturally occurring amino acids. Naturally occurring amino acids are those encoded by the genetic code as well as those amino acids that are later modified e.g. hydroxyproline carboxyglutamate and O phosphoserine. Amino acid analogs refers to compounds that have the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid i.e. an a carbon that is bound to a hydrogen a carboxyl group an amino group and an R group e.g. homoserine norleucine methionine sulfoxide and methionine methyl sulfonium. Such analogs have modified R groups e.g. norleucine or modified peptide backbones but retain the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid. Amino acid mimetics refers to chemical compounds that have a structure that is different from the general chemical structure of an amino acid but that functions in a manner similar to a naturally occurring amino acid.

Amino acids may be referred to herein by either their commonly known three letter symbols or by the one letter symbols recommended by the IUPAC IUB Biochemical Nomenclature Commission. Nucleotides likewise may be referred to by their commonly accepted single letter codes.

 Conservatively modified variants applies to both amino acid and nucleic acid sequences. With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences conservatively modified variants refers to those nucleic acids that encode identical or essentially identical amino acid sequences or where the nucleic acid does not encode an amino acid sequence to essentially identical sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein. For instance the codons GCA GCC GCG and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine Thus at every position where an alanine is specified by a codon the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are silent variations which are one species of conservatively modified variations. Every nucleic acid sequence herein which encodes a polypeptide also describes every possible silent variation of the nucleic acid. One of skill in the art will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid except AUG which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine and TGG which is ordinarily the only codon for tryptophan can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule. Accordingly each silent variation of a nucleic acid which encodes a polypeptide is implicit in each described sequence with respect to the expression product but not with respect to actual probe sequences.

As to amino acid sequences one of skill in the art will recognize that individual substitutions deletions or additions to a nucleic acid peptide polypeptide or protein sequence which alters adds or deletes a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids in the encoded sequence is a conservatively modified variant where the alteration results in the substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid. Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. Such conservatively modified variants are in addition to and do not exclude polymorphic variants interspecies homologs and alleles of the present invention.

The following eight groups each contain amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another 1 Alanine A Glycine G 2 Aspartic acid D Glutamic acid E 3 Asparagine N Glutamine Q 4 Arginine R Lysine K 5 Isoleucine I Leucine L Methionine M Valine V 6 Phenylalanine F Tyrosine Y Tryptophan W 7 Serine S Threonine T and 8 Cysteine C Methionine M see e.g. Creighton Proteins 1984 .

The term recombinant when used with reference e.g. to a cell nucleic acid protein or vector indicates that the cell nucleic acid protein or vector has been modified by the introduction of a heterologous nucleic acid or protein or the alteration of a native nucleic acid or protein or that the cell is derived from a cell so modified. Thus for example recombinant cells express genes that are not found within the native non recombinant form of the cell or express native genes that are otherwise abnormally expressed overexpressed underexpressed or not expressed at all.

The term heterologous when used with reference to portions of a nucleic acid indicates that the nucleic acid comprises two or more subsequences that are not found in the same relationship to each other in nature. For instance the nucleic acid is typically recombinantly produced having two or more sequences from unrelated genes arranged to make a new functional nucleic acid e.g. a promoter from one source and a coding region from another source. Similarly a heterologous protein indicates that the protein comprises two or more subsequences that are not found in the same relationship to each other in nature e.g. a fusion protein .

The phrase stringent hybridization conditions refers to conditions under which a probe will hybridize to its target subsequence typically in a complex mixture of nucleic acids but to no other sequences. Stringent conditions are sequence dependent and may be different in different circumstances. Longer sequences hybridize specifically at higher temperatures. An extensive guide to the hybridization of nucleic acids is found in Tijssen Overview of principles of hybridization and the strategy of nucleic acid assays 1993 . Generally stringent conditions are selected to be about 5 10 C. lower than the thermal melting point T for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength pH. The Tis the temperature under defined ionic strength pH and nucleic concentration at which 50 of the probes complementary to the target hybridize to the target sequence at equilibrium as the target sequences are present in excess at T 50 of the probes are occupied at equilibrium . Stringent conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents such as formamide. For selective or specific hybridization a positive signal is at least two times background preferably at least ten times background hybridization. Exemplary stringent hybridization conditions can be as follows 50 formamide 5 SSC and 1 SDS incubating at 42 C. or 5 SSC 1 SDS incubating at 65 C. with wash in 0.2 SSC and 0.1 SDS at 65 C.

Nucleic acids that do not hybridize to each other under stringent conditions are still substantially identical if the polypeptides that they encode are substantially identical. This occurs for example when a copy of a nucleic acid is created using the maximum codon degeneracy permitted by the genetic code. In such cases the nucleic acids typically hybridize under moderately stringent hybridization conditions. Exemplary moderately stringent hybridization conditions include a hybridization in a buffer of 40 formamide 1 M NaCl 1 SDS at 37 C. and a wash in 1 SSC at 45 C. A positive hybridization is at least twice background. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that alternative hybridization and wash conditions can be utilized to provide conditions of similar stringency. Additional guidelines for determining hybridization parameters are provided in numerous reference e.g. and ed. Ausubel et al. supra.

For PCR a temperature of about 36 C. is typical for low stringency amplification although annealing temperatures may vary between about 32 C. and about 48 C. depending on primer length. For high stringency PCR amplification a temperature of about 62 C. is typical although high stringency annealing temperatures can range from about 50 C. to about 65 C. depending on the primer length and specificity. Typical cycle conditions for both high and low stringency amplifications include a denaturation phase of about 90 95 C. for about 30 sec 2 min. an annealing phase lasting about 30 sec. 2 min. and an extension phase of about 72 C. for about 1 2 min. Protocols and guidelines for low and high stringency amplification reactions are provided e.g. in Innis et al. 1990 Academic Press Inc. N.Y.

 Antibody refers to a polypeptide comprising a framework region from an immunoglobulin gene or fragments thereof that specifically binds and recognizes an antigen. The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the kappa lambda alpha gamma delta epsilon and mu constant region genes as well as the myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are classified as gamma mu alpha delta or epsilon which in turn define the immunoglobulin classes IgG IgM IgA IgD and IgE respectively. Typically the antigen binding region of an antibody will be most critical in specificity and affinity of binding.

An exemplary immunoglobulin antibody structural unit comprises a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains each pair having one light about 25 kD and one heavy chain about 50 70 kD . The N terminus of each chain defines a variable region of about 100 to about 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The terms variable light chain V and variable heavy chain V refer to these light and heavy chains respectively.

Antibodies exist e.g. as intact immunoglobulins or as a number of well characterized fragments produced by digestion with various peptidases. Thus for example pepsin digests an antibody below the disulfide linkages in the hinge region to produce F ab a dimer of Fab which itself is a light chain joined to V C1 by a disulfide bond. The F ab may be reduced under mild conditions to break the disulfide linkage in the hinge region thereby converting the F ab dimer into an Fab monomer. The Fab monomer is essentially Fab with part of the hinge region see Paul ed. 3d ed. 1993 . While various antibody fragments are defined in terms of the digestion of an intact antibody one of skill in the art will appreciate that such fragments may be synthesized de novo either chemically or by using recombinant DNA methodology. Thus the term antibody as used herein also includes antibody fragments either produced by the modification of whole antibodies or those synthesized de novo using recombinant DNA methodologies e.g. single chain Fv or those identified using phage display libraries see e.g. McCafferty et al. 348 552 554 1990 

For preparation of antibodies e.g. recombinant monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies any technique known in the art can be used see e.g. Kohler and Milstein 256 495 497 1975 Kozbor et al. 4 72 1983 Cole et al. pp. 77 96 in Alan R. Liss Inc. 1985 Coligan 1991 Harlow and Lane 1988 and Goding 2d ed. 1986 . The genes encoding the heavy and light chains of an antibody of interest can be cloned from a cell e.g. the genes encoding a monoclonal antibody can be cloned from a hybridoma and used to produce a recombinant monoclonal antibody. Gene libraries encoding heavy and light chains of monoclonal antibodies can also be made from hybridoma or plasma cells. Random combinations of the heavy and light chain gene products generate a large pool of antibodies with different antigenic specificity see e.g. Kuby 3ed. 1997 . Techniques for the production of single chain antibodies or recombinant antibodies see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 946 778 and 4 816 567 can be adapted to produce antibodies to the polypeptides of the present invention. Also transgenic mice or other organisms such as other mammals may be used to express humanized or human antibodies see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 545 807 5 545 806 5 569 825 5 625 126 5 633 425 and 5 661 016 Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 Lonberg et al. 368 856 859 1994 Morrison 368 812 13 1994 Fishwild et al. 14 845 51 1996 Neuberger 14 826 1996 and Lonberg et al. 13 65 93 1995 . Alternatively phage display technology can be used to identify antibodies and heteromeric Fab fragments that specifically bind to selected antigens see e.g. McCafferty et al. 348 552 554 1990 Marks et al. supra . Antibodies can also be made bispecific i.e. able to recognize two different antigens see e.g. PCT Patent Publication No. WO 93 08829 Traunecker et al. 10 3655 3659 1991 and Suresh et al. 121 210 1986 . Antibodies can also be heteroconjugates e.g. two covalently joined antibodies or immunotoxins see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 PCT Patent Publication Nos. WO 91 00360 and WO 92 200373 and EP Patent No. 03089 .

Methods for humanizing or primatizing non human antibodies are well known in the art. Generally a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non human. These non human amino acid residues are often referred to as import residues which are typically taken from an import variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co workers see e.g. Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 327 1988 Verhoeyen et al. 239 1534 1536 1988 and Presta 2 593 596 1992 by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non human species. In practice humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.

A chimeric antibody is an antibody molecule in which a the constant region or a portion thereof is altered replaced or exchanged so that the antigen binding site variable region is linked to a constant region of a different or altered class effector function and or species or an entirely different molecule which confers new properties to the chimeric antibody e.g. an enzyme toxin hormone growth factor drug etc. or b the variable region or a portion thereof is altered replaced or exchanged with a variable region having a different or altered antigen specificity.

In one embodiment the antibody is conjugated to an effector moiety. The effector moiety can be any number of molecules including labeling moieties such as radioactive labels or fluorescent labels or can be a therapeutic moiety. In one embodiment the antibody modulates the activity of the protein.

The phrase specifically or selectively binds to an antibody or specifically or selectively immunoreactive with when referring to a protein or peptide refers to a binding reaction that is determinative of the presence of the protein often in a heterogeneous population of proteins and other biologics. Thus under designated immunoassay conditions the specified antibodies bind to a particular protein at least about two three four or more times the background and more typically more than at least about 10 to about 100 times the background. Specific binding to an antibody under such conditions requires an antibody that is selected for its specificity for a particular protein. For example polyclonal antibodies can be selected to obtain only those polyclonal antibodies that are specifically immunoreactive with the selected antigen and not with other proteins. This selection may be achieved by subtracting out antibodies that cross react with other molecules. A variety of immunoassay formats may be used to select antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a particular protein. For example solid phase ELISA immunoassays are routinely used to select antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a protein see e.g. Harlow and Lane 1988 for a description of immunoassay formats and conditions that can be used to determine specific immunoreactivity .

As used herein the term administering means oral administration administration as a suppository topical contact intravenous intraperitoneal intramuscular intralesional intrathecal intranasal or subcutaneous administration or the implantation of a slow release device e.g. a mini osmotic pump to a subject. Administration is by any route including parenteral and transmucosal e.g. buccal sublingual palatal gingival nasal vaginal rectal or transdermal . Parenteral administration includes e.g. intravenous intramuscular intra arteriole intradermal subcutaneous intraperitoneal intraventricular and intracranial. Other modes of delivery include but are not limited to the use of liposomal formulations intravenous infusion transdermal patches etc. By co administer it is meant that a composition described herein is administered at the same time just prior to or just after the administration of one or more additional therapies for example cancer therapies such as chemotherapy hormonal therapy radiotherapy or immunotherapy.

The compositions of the present invention can be delivered by transdermally by a topical route formulated as applicator sticks solutions suspensions emulsions gels creams ointments pastes jellies paints powders and aerosols.

The term administer or administering a transporter substrate means administering a transporter substrate e.g. an organic cation transporter substrate or norephinephrine transporter substrate to a subject and without being limited by mechanism allowing sufficient time for the transporter substrate to be translocated into a cell by a transporter and for the transporter substrate to then prevent replication of the cellular DNA or cause cell death of the cell or react with DNA or modify DNA or covalently modify DNA.

Easton Pa. and WO 96 05309 the teachings of both of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants flavors stabilizers and thickening agents as desired. Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material such as natural or synthetic gums resins methylcellulose sodium carboxymethylcellulose hydroxypropylmethylcellulose sodium alginate polyvinylpyrrolidone gum tragacanth and gum acacia and dispersing or wetting agents such as a naturally occurring phosphatide e.g. lecithin a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid e.g. polyoxyethylene stearate a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol e.g. heptadecaethylene oxycetanol a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol e.g. polyoxyethylene sorbitol mono oleate or a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride e.g. polyoxyethylene sorbitan mono oleate . The aqueous suspension can also contain one or more preservatives such as ethyl or n propyl p hydroxybenzoate one or more coloring agents one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents such as sucrose aspartame or saccharin. Formulations can be adjusted for osmolarity.

Also included are solid form preparations that are intended to be converted shortly before use to liquid form preparations for oral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions suspensions and emulsions. These preparations may contain in addition to the active component colorants flavors stabilizers buffers artificial and natural sweeteners dispersants thickeners solubilizing agents and the like.

Oil suspensions can contain a thickening agent such as beeswax hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol.

The entire contents of these patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.

Pharmaceutical compositions provided by the present invention include compositions wherein the active ingredient is contained in a therapeutically effective amount i.e. in an amount effective to achieve its intended purpose. The actual amount effective for a particular application will depend inter alia on the condition being treated. When administered in methods to treat a disease such compositions will contain an amount of active ingredient effective to achieve the desired result e.g. modulating the activity of a target molecule e.g. OCT1 OCT2 and or OCT3 or NET and or reducing eliminating or slowing the progression of disease symptoms. Determination of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention is well within the capabilities of those skilled in the art especially in light of the detailed disclosure herein.

The dosage and frequency single or multiple doses administered to a mammal can vary depending upon a variety of factors for example whether the mammal suffers from another disease and its route of administration size age sex health body weight body mass index and diet of the recipient nature and extent of symptoms of the disease being treated e.g. cancer colorectal cancer liver cancer prostate cancer renal cancer bladder cancer ovarian cancer breast cancer lung cancer leukemia B cell lymphoma non Hodgkin s lymphoma Burkitt s lymphoma Small Cell and Large Cell lymphomas multiple myeloma or other cancers that express one or more of the OCTs neuroendocrine cancers glioblastoma multiforme glioma neuroblastoma brain cancer or other cancers that express NET kind of concurrent treatment complications from the disease being treated or other health related problems. Other therapeutic regimens or agents can be used in conjunction with the methods and compounds described herein. Adjustment and manipulation of established dosages e.g. frequency and duration are well within the ability of those skilled in the art.

For any compound described herein the therapeutically effective amount can be initially determined from cell culture assays. Target concentrations will be those concentrations of active compound s that are capable of achieving the methods described herein as measured using the methods described herein or known in the art.

As is well known in the art therapeutically effective amounts for use in humans can also be determined from animal models. For example a dose for humans can be formulated to achieve a concentration that has been found to be effective in animals. The dosage in humans can be adjusted by monitoring compounds effectiveness and adjusting the dosage upwards or downwards as described above. Adjusting the dose to achieve maximal efficacy in humans based on the methods described above and other methods is well within the capabilities of the ordinarily skilled artisan.

Dosages may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the compound being employed. The dose administered to a patient in the context of the present invention should be sufficient to effect a beneficial therapeutic response in the patient over time. The size of the dose also will be determined by the existence nature and extent of any adverse side effects. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the practitioner. Generally treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under circumstances is reached. In one embodiment the dosage range is 0.001 to 10 w v. In another embodiment the dosage range is 0.1 to 5 w v.

Dosage amounts and intervals can be adjusted individually to provide levels of the administered compound effective for the particular clinical indication being treated. This will provide a therapeutic regimen that is commensurate with the severity of the individual s disease state.

Utilizing the teachings provided herein an effective prophylactic or therapeutic treatment regimen can be planned that does not cause substantial toxicity and yet is effective to treat the clinical symptoms demonstrated by the particular patient. This planning should involve the careful choice of active compound by considering factors such as compound potency relative bioavailability patient body weight presence and severity of adverse side effects preferred mode of administration and the toxicity profile of the selected agent.

The ratio between toxicity and therapeutic effect for a particular compound is its therapeutic index and can be expressed as the ratio between LD the amount of compound lethal in 50 of the population and ED the amount of compound effective in 50 of the population . Compounds that exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. Therapeutic index data obtained from cell culture assays and or animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosages for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds preferably lies within a range of plasma concentrations that include the EDwith little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. See e.g. Fingl et al. In TPBT Ch. 1 p. 1 1975. The exact formulation route of administration and dosage can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient s condition and the particular method in which the compound is used.

In some embodiments are methods of diagnosing or providing a prognosis for a cancer therapy e.g. therapy for a cancer that expresses at least one OCT or NET marker e.g. OCT1 OCT2 and or OCT3 such as colorectal cancer or liver cancer or brain cancer or neuroendocrine cancer. As used herein the term providing a prognosis refers to providing a prediction of the probable course recommended therapy and outcome of a cancer or the likelihood of recovery from the cancer.

In some embodiments cancer patients with positive or high OCT or NET expression have a longer disease specific survival as compared to those with negative or low expression. As such the level of OCT or NET expression can be used as a prognostic indicator with positive or high expression as an indication of a good prognosis e.g. a longer disease specific survival.

In some embodiments the methods of the present invention can also be useful for diagnosing the severity of a cancer e.g. a cancer that expresses at least one OCT or NET marker. As a non limiting example the level of OCT or NET expression can be used to determine the stage or grade of a cancer such as colorectal cancer e.g. according to the Tumor Nodes Metastases TNM system of classification International Union Against Cancer 6th edition 2002 the Dukes staging system Dukes 35 323 1932 or the Astler Coller staging system Astler et al. 139 846 1954 . Typically cancers are staged using a combination of physical examination blood tests and medical imaging. If tumor tissue is obtained via biopsy or surgery examination of the tissue under a microscope can also provide pathologic staging. In some embodiments cancer patients with positive or high OCT or NET expression may have a more severe stage or grade of that type of cancer. As such the level of OCT or NET expression can be used as a diagnostic indicator of the severity of a cancer or of the risk of developing a more severe stage or grade of the cancer. In certain other instances the stage or grade of a cancer assists a practitioner in determining the prognosis for the cancer and in selecting the appropriate cancer therapy.

Diagnosis or prognosis can involve determining the level of OCT or NET expression i.e. transcription or translation in a patient and then comparing the level or localization to a baseline or range. In some embodiments the baseline value is representative of OCT or NET expression levels in a healthy person not suffering from the disease e.g. cancer . Variation of levels of a polypeptide or polynucleotide of the present invention from the baseline range i.e. either up or down may indicate that the patient has a cancer or is at risk of developing a cancer. Variation of levels of a polypeptide or polynucleotide of the present invention from the baseline range i.e. either up or down may indicate that the patient has a cancer that would respond to platinum based compound therapy or would not respond to platinum based compound therapy. In some embodiments the level of OCT or NET expression is measured by taking a blood urine or tissue sample from a patient and measuring the amount of a polypeptide or polynucleotide of the present invention in the sample using any number of detection methods such as those discussed herein. In some embodiments the presence of OCT or NET expression in a sample is indicative that the patient should receive platinum based compound treatment as described herein. In some embodiments an increased level of OCT or NET expression in a sample compared to a control is indicative that the patient should receive platinum based compound treatment as described herein.

Any antibody based technique for determining a level of expression of a protein of interest can be used to measure the level of OCT or NET expression in tumor tissue or cancerous cells e.g. ELISA assays immunoprecipitation assays and immunohistochemical assays . One skilled in the art will know of additional antibody based techniques that can be used for determining a level of OCT or NET expression. PCR assays can be used to detect expression levels of nucleic acids as well as to discriminate between variants in genomic structure such as insertion deletion mutations truncations or splice variants.

In some embodiments the expression of at least one OCT or NET marker in a cancerous or potentially cancerous tissue may be evaluated by visualizing the presence and or localization of the OCT or NET marker in the subject. The visualization of cancerous or potentially cancerous tissue in live subjects can be performed using anti OCT OCT1 OCT2 and or OCT3 or anti NET antibodies or other molecules that specifically interacts or binds to an OCT or NET transcript or to a polypeptide encoded by the transcript.

A detectable moiety can be coupled either directly or indirectly to anti OCT antibodies or anti NET antibodies using methods well known in the art e.g. radionuclides fluorescent dyes e.g. fluorescein fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC Oregon Green rhodamine Texas red tetrarhodimine isothiocynate TRITC Cy3 Cy5 etc. fluorescent markers e.g. green fluorescent protein GFP phycoerythrin etc. autoquenched fluorescent compounds that are activated by tumor associated proteases enzymes e.g. luciferase horseradish peroxidase alkaline phosphatase etc. nanoparticles biotin digoxigenin .

In some embodiments a composition or method of detection may be used to visualize live subjects using any device or method known in the art e.g. Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography SPECT radionuclide scintigraphy Positron Emission Tomography PET a laparoscopic probe see U.S. Pat. No. 5 429 133 Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI radiography i.e. X rays computed tomography CT fluoroscopy or other methods known in the art .

In some embodiments in vivo optical imaging techniques may be suitable for the visualization of fluorescent and or enzymatic labels or markers e.g. fluorescence microendoscopy see e.g. Flusberg et al. 30 2272 2274 2005 fiber optic fluorescence imaging see e.g. Flusberg et al. 2 941 950 2005 fluorescence imaging using a flying spot scanner see e.g. Ramanujam et al. 48 1034 1041 2001 catheter based imaging systems see e.g. Funovics et al. 231 659 666 2004 near infrared imaging systems see e.g. Mahmood et al. 213 866 870 1999 fluorescence molecular tomography see e.g. Gurfinkel et al. 19 107 121 2004 and bioluminescent imaging see e.g. Dikmen et al. 35 65 70 2005 .

Anti OCT antibodies or anti NET antibodies when conjugated to any of the above described detectable moieties can be administered in doses effective to achieve the desired image of tumor tissue or cancerous cells in a subject. Such detection is aimed at determining where one or more OCT or NET markers are concentrated in a subject with such concentration being an indicator of the location of a tumor or tumor cells. Alternatively such detection is aimed at determining the extent of tumor regression in a subject with the size of the tumor being an indicator of the efficacy of cancer therapy.

Diagnosis or prognosis can further involve determining the genotype of at least one OCT marker or NET marker in a subject. For example genotyping an OCT or NET nucleic acid marker at a polymorphic site for alleles that result in decreased or increased organic cation transporter activity can be useful in diagnosing or providing a prognosis for cancers that express the OCT or NET marker. In certain instances an OCT or NET nucleic acid marker that comprises a variant allele resulting in no or substantially reduced substrate transporter activity is indicative of a cancer that does not express the OCT or NET marker. A subject having this genotype would have a cancer that may be resistant to platinum based compound or drug therapy and may have a poor prognosis for cancer using such therapy. Variant alleles in OCT1 and OCT2 which comprise polymorphisms suitable for detecting in the methods of the present invention are described in e.g. Shu et al. 100 5902 5907 2003 and Leabman et al. 12 395 405 2002 .

In some embodiments the methods of the present invention include determining whether or not OCT or NET protein or nucleic acid e.g. mRNA is expressed in a sample. As used herein the term determining whether or not OCT or NET protein or nucleic acid is expressed refers to determining the presence or level of at least one OCT or NET marker of interest e.g. OCT1 OCT2 and or OCT3 or NET by using any quantitative or qualitative assay known to one of skill in the art. In some embodiments of the methods described herein prognostic or diagnostic methods as described above are combined with the methods of using the compounds described herein e.g. formula I Ia II IIa III IIIa IV or V including embodiments .

In some embodiments an OCT or NET protein marker is analyzed using an immunoassay although other methods are well known to those skilled in the art e.g. the measurement of marker RNA levels . Immunoassay techniques and protocols are generally described in Price and Newman Principles and Practice of Immunoassay 2nd Edition Grove s Dictionaries 1997 and Gosling Immunoassays A Practical Approach Oxford University Press 2000. The presence or amount of an OCT or NET protein marker is generally determined using antibodies specific for the marker and detecting specific binding. For example polyclonal antibodies directed to OCT1 OCT2 or OCT3 can be obtained from Alpha Diagnostics Intl. Inc. San Antonio Tex. .

Any suitable immunoassay can be utilized for determining whether or not OCT or NET protein is expressed in a sample e.g. enzyme immunoassays EIA such as enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique EMIT enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA IgM antibody capture ELISA MAC ELISA and microparticle enzyme immunoassay MEIA capillary electrophoresis immunoassays CEIA radioimmunoassays RIA immunoradiometric assays IRMA fluorescence polarization immunoassays FPIA and chemiluminescence assays CL . If desired such immunoassays can be automated. Immunoassays can also be used in conjunction with laser induced fluorescence see e.g. Schmalzing et al. 18 2184 93 1997 Bao 699 463 80 1997 . Liposome immunoassays such as flow injection liposome immunoassays and liposome immunosensors see e.g. Rongen et al. 204 105 133 1997 or nephelometry assays may be used in the methods of detecting the presence of a marker as described herein.

Specific immunological binding of the antibody to OCT or NET protein can be detected directly or indirectly e.g. direct detection may include fluorescent or luminescent tags metals dyes radionuclides . An antibody labeled with iodine 125 I can be used for determining whether or not OCT or NET protein is expressed in a sample. A chemiluminescence assay using a chemiluminescent antibody specific for an OCT or NET protein marker is suitable for sensitive non radioactive detection of OCT or NET protein levels. An antibody labeled with fluorochrome is also suitable for determining whether or not OCT or NET protein is expressed in a sample e.g. DAPI fluorescein Hoechst 33258 R phycocyanin B phycoerythrin R phycoerythrin rhodamine Texas red and lissamine . Indirect labels include various enzymes well known in the art such as horseradish peroxidase HRP alkaline phosphatase AP galactosidase urease and the like. A horseradish peroxidase detection system can be used for example with the chromogenic substrate tetramethylbenzidine TMB which yields a soluble product in the presence of hydrogen peroxide that is detectable at 450 nm. An alkaline phosphatase detection system can be used with the chromogenic substrate p nitrophenyl phosphate for example which yields a soluble product readily detectable at 405 nm. Similarly a galactosidase detection system can be used with the chromogenic substrate o nitrophenyl D galactopyranoside ONPG which yields a soluble product detectable at 410 nm. An urease detection system can be used with a substrate such as urea bromocresol purple Sigma Immunochemicals St. Louis Mo. . A signal from the label can be analyzed for example using a spectrophotometer to detect color from a chromogenic substrate a radiation counter to detect radiation such as a gamma counter for detection of I or a fluorometer to detect fluorescence in the presence of light of a certain wavelength.

Antigen capture assays can be useful in the methods of the present invention. For example in an antigen capture assay an antibody directed to an OCT or NET protein marker is bound to a solid phase and sample is added such that OCT or NET protein is bound by the antibody. After unbound proteins are removed by washing the amount of bound marker can be quantitated using for example a radioimmunoassay see e.g. Harlow and Lane Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory New York 1988 . Sandwich enzyme immunoassays can also be useful in the methods of the present invention. For example in a two antibody sandwich assay a first antibody is bound to a solid support and OCT or NET protein is allowed to bind to the first antibody. The amount of OCT or NET protein is quantitated by measuring the amount of a second antibody that binds the marker. The antibodies can be immobilized onto a variety of solid supports such as magnetic or chromatographic matrix particles the surface of an assay plate e.g. microtiter wells pieces of a solid substrate material or membrane e.g. plastic nylon paper and the like. An assay strip can be prepared by coating the antibody or a plurality of antibodies in an array on a solid support. This strip can then be dipped into the test sample and processed quickly through washes and detection steps to generate a measurable signal such as a colored spot.

Quantitative western blotting can also be used to detect or determine whether or not OCT or NET protein is expressed in a sample. Western blots can be quantitated by well known methods such as scanning densitometry or phosphorimaging.

Alternatively a variety of immunohistochemistry IHC techniques can be used to determine whether or not OCT or NET protein is expressed in a sample. As used herein the term immunohistochemistry or IHC encompasses techniques that utilize the visual detection of fluorescent dyes or enzymes coupled i.e. conjugated to antibodies that react with the OCT or NET protein marker using fluorescent microscopy or light microscopy e.g. direct fluorescent antibody indirect fluorescent antibody IFA anticomplement immunofluorescence avidin biotin immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase assays .

The presence or level of an OCT or NET protein marker can also be determined by detecting or quantifying the amount of the purified marker. Purification of OCT or NET protein can be achieved for example by high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC alone or in combination with mass spectrometry e.g. MALDI MS MALDI TOF MS tandem MS etc. . Qualitative or quantitative detection of OCT or NET protein can also be determined by well known methods including without limitation Bradford assays Coomassie blue staining silver staining assays for radiolabeled protein and mass spectrometry.

The analysis of a plurality of OCT or NET protein markers may be carried out separately or simultaneously with one test sample. For separate or sequential assay of OCT or NET protein markers suitable apparatuses include clinical laboratory analyzers such as the ElecSys Roche the AxSym Abbott the Access Beckman the ADVIA the CENTAUR Bayer and the NICHOLS ADVANTAGE Nichols Institute immunoassay systems. Preferred apparatuses or protein chips perform simultaneous assays of a plurality of OCT or NET protein markers on a single surface. Particularly useful physical formats comprise surfaces having a plurality of discrete addressable locations for the detection of a plurality of different biomarkers. Such formats include protein microarrays or protein chips see e.g. Ng et al. 6 329 340 2002 and certain capillary devices see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 019 944 . In these embodiments each discrete surface location may comprise antibodies to immobilize one or more OCT or NET protein markers for detection at each location. Surfaces may alternatively comprise one or more discrete particles e.g. microparticles or nanoparticles immobilized at discrete locations of a surface where the microparticles comprise antibodies to immobilize one or more OCT or NET protein markers for detection.

In addition to the above described assays for determining whether or not OCT or NET protein is expressed in a sample analysis of OCT or NET marker mRNA levels using routine techniques such as Northern analysis reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction RT PCR or any other methods based on hybridization to a nucleic acid sequence that is complementary to a portion of the marker coding sequence e.g. slot blot hybridization are also within the scope of the present invention. The mRNA expression of a gene of interest is typically evaluated in vitro on a sample collected from the subject in comparison to a normal or reference sample. Applicable PCR amplification techniques are described in e.g. Ausubel et al. Theophilus et al. and Innis et al. supra. General nucleic acid hybridization methods are described in Anderson Nucleic Acid Hybridization BIOS Scientific Publishers 1999. Amplification or hybridization of a plurality of transcribed nucleic acid sequences e.g. mRNA or cDNA can also be performed from mRNA or cDNA sequences arranged in a microarray. Microarray methods are generally described in Hardiman Microarrays Methods and Applications Nuts Bolts DNA Press 2003 and Baldi et al. DNA Microarrays and Gene Expression From Experiments to Data Analysis and Modeling Cambridge University Press 2002.

Analysis of the genotype of an OCT or NET nucleic acid marker can be performed using techniques known in the art including without limitation polymerase chain reaction PCR based analysis sequence analysis and electrophoretic analysis. A non limiting example of a PCR based analysis includes a Taqman allelic discrimination assay available from Applied Biosystems. Non limiting examples of sequence analysis include Maxam Gilbert sequencing Sanger sequencing capillary array DNA sequencing thermal cycle sequencing Sears et al. 13 626 633 1992 solid phase sequencing Zimmerman et al. 3 39 42 1992 sequencing with mass spectrometry such as matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry MALDI TOF MS Fu et al. 16 381 384 1998 and sequencing by hybridization Chee et al. 274 610 614 1996 Drmanac et al. 260 1649 1652 1993 Drmanac et al. 16 54 58 1998 . Non limiting examples of electrophoretic analysis include slab gel electrophoresis such as agarose or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis capillary electrophoresis and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Other methods for genotyping a subject at a polymorphic site in an OCT or NET nucleic acid marker include e.g. the INVADER assay from Third Wave Technologies Inc. restriction fragment length polymorphism RFLP analysis allele specific oligonucleotide hybridization a heteroduplex mobility assay and single strand conformational polymorphism SSCP analysis.

Analysis of whether or not an OCT or NET nucleic acid has been gene amplified or deleted in a sample can also be used in the pharmacogenetic diagnostic and prognostic methods described herein. In some embodiments the presence or level of gene amplification or deletion of one or more OCT or NET nucleic acid markers can be determined by DNA based techniques such as PCR or Southern blot analysis or by molecular cytogenetic techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH chromogenic in situ hybridization CISH and immunohistochemistry. Other techniques include genome wide scanning of amplified chromosomal regions with comparative genomic hybridization for the detection of amplified regions in tumor DNA see e.g. Kallioniemi et al. 258 818 821 1992 and the detection of gene amplification by genomic hybridization to cDNA microarrays see e.g. Heiskanen et al. 60 799 802 2000 . One skilled in the art will know of additional gene amplification or deletion techniques that can be used to detect or determine a level of an amplified gene that corresponds to one or more OCT or NET nucleic acid markers of the present invention.

In another embodiment the present invention provides kits for carrying out the therapeutic diagnostic and prognostic assays described herein. The kits typically include one or more probes that comprise an antibody or nucleic acid sequence that specifically binds to the polypeptides or polynucleotides of the present invention and a label for detecting the presence of the probe. The kits can find use for example for measuring the levels of OCT or NET protein or OCT or NET transcripts or for measuring OCT or NET activity to a target substrate. The kits may also include several polynucleotide sequences encoding polypeptides of the present invention.

Members of the solute carrier SLC 22A family OCT1 SLC22A1 and OCT2 SLC22A2 mediate the intracellular uptake of structurally diverse organic cations that includes endogenous cations such as choline creatinine and a variety of xenobiotics such as tetraethylammonium TEA a prototypic organic cation the neurotoxin MPP 1 methyl 4 pyridinium . It is quite likely that these transporters are expressed by neoplastic liver cells. Any increase in the affinity of oxaliplatin like or other platinum complex towards OCTs holds the promise of delivering a therapeutic agent that possesses a far greater efficacy and specificity for any cancer that retains a high level of OCT expression than the agents currently used.

Several mechanistic investigations have established the monoaquated complex of compounds such as oxaliplatin to be the form that is transporter by the OCTs. This complex has a net one positive charge . Such complexes are highly unstable in nature due to their tremendous susceptibility toward the displacement of the water molecule by a chloride ion forming a neutral dichloro compound. Chemical mimics of the monoaqua complex that have similar stereoelectronic properties may possess the ability to be recognized by OCTs as substrates. In effect this implies a chemically stable entity whose activity is channeled towards an OCT expressing tumor.

Examples of another type of platinum complex are listed in Table 2. The dichlorides on the leaving group side may be intact and may form bidentate chelates with DNA possibly similar to those formed by oxaliplatin.

Examples of another type of platinum complex are listed in Table 3 which comprises trans platinum complexes that may form bi or monodentate complexes with DNA.

Evaluation of compounds was carried out in an in vitro cytotoxicity assay involving a comparison between the effect of the platinum complex on human embryonic kidney cells HEK293 transfected with human OCT1 HEK hOCT1 and OCT2 HEK hOCT2 versus those that are not transfected. The results indicated that the positively charged complexes are much better substrates for OCT1 and OCT2 than oxaliplatin itself. The ICvalues of these new synthesized complexes were 20 170 times lower in OCT transfected cell lines when compared with untransfected cells. Cytotoxicities of individual platinum complexes are listed in table 1 2 and 3.

The increased cytotoxicity of the compounds described herein was determined in HEK hOCT1 cells when compared to untransfected cells and suggests an increased cellular uptake and accumulation.

Evidence for the higher accumulation of platinum based compounds described herein was obtained through a comparison of the cellular uptake of select compounds vs. oxaliplatin in OCT1 transfected and untransfected cells. A higher accumulation of compounds when compared to the accumulation of oxaliplatin in HEK OCT1 cells both in comparison to untransfected cells serves to confirm that platinum based compounds described herein have an increased cellular uptake in OCT expressing cells. Similar results were obtained when platinum DNA adducts concentration was quantitated in HEK OCT1 and HEK MOCK cells. These experiments clearly demonstrated that platinum based compounds could be used as targeted anticancer therapy.

Similar results were obtained for the series of our synthetic platinum complexes tables 1 2 and 3 . Also certain complexes were found to be substrates for OCT2 tables 1 2 and 3 and OCT3 table 4 . This greatly substantiates our original proposition of the stereoelectronic mimicry of the bioactive mono aqua complex to achieve higher affinity for OCTs.

Our preliminary in vivo toxicity experiments in nude mice have indeed lended support for our rational design of targeted platinum complexes.

Based on our in vitro findings that positively charged synthetic platinum complexes are very good substrates of OCTs a complete in vivo efficacy evaluation of lead compounds is being carried out in transgenic and xenograft mouse models for cancer. Further the efficacy of these complexes is being tested in cancer cell lines expressing OCTs. Based on the pharmacokinetic properties of these lead complexes further structural optimization is being carried out to develop platinum compounds with enhanced specificity for OCTs. We are developing platinum anticancer compounds that are excellent substrates of OCTs for the purpose of targeted therapy of cancers with high level expression of human OCTs. This approach can enhance the therapeutic efficacy and reduce systemic toxicity of the platinum based anticancer drugs due to the enrichment of platinum compounds in cells with high level of OCT expression. Oxaliplatin and its synthetic platinum analogs can be used for the treatment of the cancers expressing relatively high levels of OCTs since they are expected to be enriched in the liver tumor cells due to the high level of OCT expression.

This study provides a pharmacogenomic basis for the selection of patients based on the expression level of a particular transporter for treatment with these novel anticancer agents and moving towards individualized therapy. A net increase in the therapeutic efficacy and decrease of systemic toxicity is a desired characteristic of these anticancer compounds.

Targeting OCTs enhances the delivery of platinum compounds to OCT expressing tumors and hence decreases the toxicity to cells which do not express OCTs. Currently synthezied platinum analogs of oxaliplatin will for the first time bring into practice the currently hypothetical individualized treatment for cancer since the expression level and or polymorphism of these transporters will dictate the response and or adverse reactions of their treatment.

Utilization of either the siRNA approach and or the use of an inhibitor of hOCTs for diminishing the efficacy of the lead compounds is being used to confirm the utilization of OCTs to get inside cells by these compounds. We are performing in vivo studies in transgenic and xenograft mouse models for cancers to produce a proof of concept. Further effect of individual OCT on pharmacokinetics and efficacy of new platinum complexes is being evaluated in specific OCT knockout mice. Based on the efficacy toxicity and PK PD data for our lead compounds from our preliminary in vivo screen we are rationally modifying optimizing the structural features of these currently promising compounds.

Platinum complexes are some of the most widely used drugs for the treatment of cancers especially solid tumors. Unfortunately their tissue distribution is either nonspecific or of a specificity that is insufficient to cause adequate selective accumulation so as to deliver an adequate cytotoxic effect. We have found that the distribution of platinum complexes into various body tissues including tumors or neoplasms can be influenced through design of ligands that confer upon the platinum complex increased affinity for a particular influx transport mechanism. This enhanced affinity translates into higher sequestration of the platinum into tissues that express the particular influx transport mechanism. Higher tissue accumulation translates into 1 higher anticancer potency and 2 lower potential of adverse effects because the platinum is channeled away from the tissue where adverse effects occur.

In some embodiments the platinum based compound comprises one platinum ion in either the 2 or the 4 oxidation state. The nature of ligand attachment to the Pt ion may be an ionic bond or a dative covalent coordinate bond. In some embodiments ionic bonds may be present bridging ligands or the Pt containing compound and a counterion without the involvement of the platinum ion in the said bridging unit.

We have synthesized a large 100 library of platinum based compounds. Described herein is the application these platinum based compounds to the targeting of Norepinephrine Transporter NET . A set platinum compounds are selected to exemplify this concept SM 73 and SM 85 .

Table 4 shows the toxicity of these compounds toward HEK cells that are either transfected stably with the Norepinephrine Transporter or are empty vector cells. The platinums in bear ligands that confer upon them varying degrees of affinity for NET which is translated into varying cytotoxicities that are dependent on the presence of absence of NET.

The term resistance factor is a measure of selectivity conferred upon the platinum based compound by the inclusion of ligands that promote recognition by NET. From Table 4 it is clear that SM 73 is 5.5 fold more effective against HEK cells that express NET.

The success of our targeting strategy can be gauged in vitro also through comparing the uptake of the platinum complex into cells. The actual effects of this increased uptake can in turn be ascertained and quantified through comparison of DNA binding of the platinum complexes.

Overall it is clear that the targeted platinum agents are more selective for accumulation into NET expressing HEK cells when compared to the non targeted platinum agent cisplatin. Their individual selectivities vary and correspond well with their resistance factor values described previously SM 73 is once again the most selective 3.25 fold platinum agent.

Compounds SM 73 and SM 85 are assayed against an array of neuroblastoma cell lines. Table 5 shows their toxicity against seven neuroblastoma cell lines.

SM 73 and SM 85 retain the efficacy of cisplatin against the seven neuroblastoma cell lines in spite of added steric bulk.

The efficacy of SM 73 may be related to the degree of NET expression in the seven tested cell lines. Cisplatin showed no such correlation. Increased efficacy arises from targeted cellular accumulation rather than nonspecific chemical reactivity.

The present studies demonstrate the advantage of using the newly synthesized platinum agent SM73 in vivo. SM 73 is being tested against neuroblastoma xenografts to ascertain retention of a significant degree of efficacy when compared to cisplatin. An evaluation is being conducted in various body tissues plasma to determine toxicity.

Blood CBC Kidney and Liver function tests of the mice treated with SM 73 in the present studies were similar to the vehicle treated control group while the cisplatin treated group shows results indicative of some nephrotoxicity. The SM 73 treated mice group was also evaluated for ototoxicity. No ototoxicity was observed in sharp contrast to the well known clinically observed ototoxic effects of cisplatin.

We are currently evaluating similar newly synthesized platinum complexes targeted to influx transporters expressed by human cancer cells for development of invidualized cancer treatment.

Overview of Methods An initial toxicity study is performed on oxaliplatin and two platinum analogs identified SM73 and SM85 to determine their maximum tolerated doses MTDs and pharmacokinetic profiles. The determined MTDs serves as a guideline for selecting the proper dose for studying the efficacy of these platinums. Stably transfected HEK293 cells with empty vector and OCT1 or OCT2 or OCT3 or NET are employed in this study. These cells lines are implanted subcutaneously in mice and the mice are subsequently treated with oxaliplatin SM73 and SM85. Tumor growth rate and survival is monitored twice weekly for four weeks.

Determination of the maximum tolerated dose Nude mice are being injected weekly for four weeks with three doses of oxaliplatin SM73 and SM85 3 mice per group by an intravenous tail vein injection. From the results of in vitro cytotoxicity experiments we are selecting the following doses oxaliplatin 3 10 30 mg kg SM73 10 30 50 mg kg SM85 30 50 90 mg kg . Toxicity is being determined by 1 twice weekly body weight measurements 2 CBC at 2 and 4 weeks 3 daily visual inspection 4 liver function test and full serum panel from terminal bleed at the end of the study. Pharmacokinetic parameters for each platinum compound are being determined by measuring platinum blood plasma levels at 0.17 2 4 8 24 h. Tissue accumulation of platinum is being determined after 48 h of a single bolus intravenous tail vein injection of each platinum drug.

Tumor Induction The choice of HEK293 cells for this study is influenced by their modest tumor growth rates and their well documented ability to express readily the transfected mammalian proteins. In this study nude mice are being divided into different treatment groups 1 4. tumors consisting of HEK293 cells stably expressing OCT1 or OCT2 or OCT3 or NET respectively 6. tumors consisting of HEK293 cells expressing the vector alone. For these different groups tumors are being induced by a subcutaneous injection of 7 10HEK293 cells into the flanks of mice. Animals are being maintained in pathogen free conditions in autoclaved microisolator cages. Serial tumor measurements are being obtained every 3 4 days by a caliper in three dimensions. Tumor volumes are being calculated according to the following formula volume height weight length 0.5236. Tumors are being allowed to grow for 15 days in both treatment groups or until their mean size approximated 150 mm.

Drug Treatment and Evaluation For drug treatment animals with equal tumor sizes are being divided randomly into four groups saline oxaliplatin SM73 and SM85 three mice per group . Based on the MTD determined for each of the platinums animals are being treated by intravenous tail vein injection of oxaliplatin 10 mg kg SM73 15 mg kg and SM85 30 mg kg once a week for four weeks. Body weights and tumor volumes are being measured twice a week. Decrease in the tumor size expressed as a percentage of the tumor size observed in the group being treated with saline is being regarded as an indicator of the efficacy of these drugs.

Statistical Comparisons Tumor volumes for each drug treatment are being compared to saline treatment for each tumor type at various time points until sacrifice. ANalysis Of VAriance ANOVA is being used to compare within and between treatment groups. A p value lower than 0.05 is being considered significant.

The main purpose of this efficacy study in OCT1 or OCT2 or OCT3 or NET expressing xenografts is to verify an improved response as measured by tumor volume in the tumor bearing mice treated with oxaliplatin or new platinum leads in comparison to tumor bearing mice treated with saline.

All compounds were synthesized by directly following the literature procedures or slight modifications of them. Cisplatin transplatin or potassium tetrachloroplatinate served as starting materials.

Cisplatin was dehalogenated with silver nitrate and the intermediate was then substituted by the desired amine group to obtain subclass I compounds. Following the work of Hollis et al. cisplatin 1.5 mmol was mixed in dry DMF 8 mL and the mixture was treated with silver nitrate 1.43 mmol at ambient temperature. After 24 h precipitated silver chloride was filtered off and the requisite amine 1.5 mmol was added in one portion to the filtrate. After incubation of this mixture for 24 h at ambient temperature it was evaporated to remove most of the solvent and then triturated successively with CHCland with EtO until a TLC spot of the washings showed no response to charring after being dipped in 1 anisaldehyde in ethanol. The solid residue was then recrystallized from methanol to afford the cis Pt NH Amine Cl NO products. The color ranged from off white to yellow. Hollis L S Amundsen A R Stern E W.

Significant difficulties were met with during the substitution of one of the ammonia ligands in cisplatin with a chloride resulting in a low yield of the trichloro amino platinum complex. However once prepared a sequence consisting of displacement of one of the chlorides with iodide followed by substitution with a substituted amine trans to the iodide vide infra deiodination with Ag and replacement with chloride again trans to the amine worked. These compounds were prepared through a modified form of a reported preparative procedure Giandomenico 1995 .

To dimethylacetamide 100 mL distilled freshly from CaH was added EtNCl.HO 780 mg 4.41 mmol and the mixture was distilled under a pressure of 1 mmHg to remove ca. 20 mL of the solvent. To the remaining pale yellow solution was added cisplatin 1.09 g 3.66 mmol and the mixture was stirred at 90 C. under Ar overnight. The resulting solution was then evaporated to its volume and poured into ether hexanes 1 1 200 mL and stored at 20 C. overnight during which an oily residue separated from the mixture. The supernatant was decanted and the oily residue taken up in ca. 15 of water filtered and treated with well swelled Dowex 50W X8 cationic resin for 2 h. The mixture was filtered resin washed with 10 mL of water and the combined filtrates where evaporated under 0.5 mmHg to a volume of 1 2 mL. Saturated aqueous KCl 4 mL was added and the mixture cooled in an ice bath for an hour resulting in orange crystals that were collected to afford K PtClNH .0.5HO 676 mg 49 .

To K PtClNH .0.5HO 100 mg 0.27 mmol in water 1 mL was added sodium iodide 80 mg 2 equiv 0.54 mmol and the requisite Amine 0.41 mmol e.g. piperazine or substituted piperazine . After stirring vigorously at ambient temperature overnight the yellow precipitate was isolated by filtration and triturated with water 10 mL 3 and acetone 10 mL 3 . The solid was then dried under 1 mm Hg to afford Na PtClIAmineNH .HO 84 mg 67 .

To Na PtClIAmineNH .HO 80 mg was added AgNO 1 equiv under exclusion of light followed by HO 5 mL . This mixture was stirred until a test of silver ion was negative. About 1.00 g of activated charcoal was then added and the mixture was filtered after stirring for an hour. HCl 2 mL was then added causing precipitation of a solid over 24 h. The solid was collected by filtration washed with EtOH EtOAc and then ether and dried under 0.5 mmHg to afford 68 mg 51 of Na PtCl AmineNH . Giandomenico C M Abrams M J Murrer B A et al.

Synthesis of Certain Class C Compounds followed a literature protocol Scheme 2 . Synthesis of subclass VI compounds followed the procedure used for subclass I compounds with the exception of transplatin being the starting material. Procedures followed for class C compounds were adapted Najajreh 2002 .

The procedure is analogous to that for the preparation of Class A compounds. Najajreh Y Perez J M Navarro Ranninger C Gibson D. Novel soluble cationic trans diaminedichloroplatinum II complexes that are active against cisplatin resistant ovarian cancer cell lines. J Med Chem 2002 45 5189 95.

All compounds were verified by H NMR and their homogeneity was ascertained through elemental analysis with less than 0.4 of deviation in the expected and experimental values being regarded as proof of purity Table 10 .

To determine the OCT1 specificity and cytotoxicity of the platinum based compounds by comparing the cytotoxicity uptake and DNA adduct formation in cells transfected with OCT1 versus untransfected cells. Compounds synthesized were evaluated in three types of in vitro experiments 1 cytotoxicity assay 2 platinum uptake assay 3 platinum DNA adducts quantitation assay.

In these studies oxaliplatin and platinum based compounds described herein were exposed to hOCTs transfected HEK cell lines to determine their cytotoxicity. Platinum uptake and platinum DNA adduct formation was then measured in these transfected cell lines. In some cases chemical inhibitors of OCT1 were used. In general we used disopyramide 150 M . At this concentration disopyramide has been shown to completely inhibit the uptake of model organic cations by OCT1. Furthermore at this concentration it is selective for OCT1 over OCT2. In some cases cimetidine 3 mM was used as a general OCT inhibitor. Cytotoxicity of some of the leads was determined in colon cancer cell lines. Described below in some detail are the methods for these studies.

HEK293 cell lines stably expressing hOCT1 hOCT2 and hOCT3. The following colon cancer cell lines were also used HCT116 RKO DLD HT29 and SW620 purchased from American Type Tissue Culture collection.

The cytotoxicity of oxaliplatin platinum based compounds described herein was measured by standard MTT thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide assays in 96 well plates. After overnight incubation the platinum compound with or without an OCT inhibitor disopyramide was then be added to the culture medium to various concentrations. After exposure to the drug for 7 hours the drug containing medium was replaced with fresh drug free medium and the incubation was continued for 72 hours. The IC the drug concentration that inhibits 50 of cell growth values were obtained by fitting the percent of the maximal cell growth at different drug concentrations F to the equation F 100 1 C IC C using WinNonlin Pharsight Mountain View Calif. . The maximal cell growth is considered to be the cell growth in the medium without any platinum compounds C is the concentration of the platinum compound and is the slope factor.

The cells were incubated in the culture medium containing 10 M concentrations of oxaliplatin or synthetic platinum analogs with or without an OCT1 inhibitor disopyramide. Cell pellets obtained after centrifugation were dissolved in 70 nitric acid. Distilled water containing 10 ppb of iridium Sigma and 0.1 Triton X 100 was then added. The platinum content was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ICP MS in the Analytical Facility at University of California at Santa Cruz. Accumulation was normalized to protein content.

The cells were incubated in the culture medium containing 10 M concentration of oxaliplatin or platinum based compounds with or without an OCT inhibitor. After incubation genomic DNA was isolated from the cell pellets using Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit Promega Madison Wis. following the manufacturer s instructions. The genomic DNA was used for determination of platinum ICP MS and DNA content absorption spectrometry at 260 nm . Platinum DNA adduct formation was expressed as amount of platinum per amount of DNA.

Platinum based compound as described herein at a 100 M concentration was reacted with physiological concentration of GSH and the absorption at 260 nm was measured to monitor the progress of the reaction. Absorption as a function of time 0 t 1440 min for platinum concentration of zero was subtracted from the absorption at each platinum concentration. Initial rates were calculated from the early time points as change in absorption over change in time.

In the studies using OCT transfected cells comparisons of IC uptake and platinum DNA adduct formation was performed between OCTs expressing cells and control empty vector transfected cells . In the colon cancer cell lines the same comparisons were made in the presence and absence of disopyramide. Standard t tests will be used with a p value set at 0.05 two tailed .

Evaluation of all three classes of compounds was carried out in an in vitro cytotoxicity assay involving a comparison between the effect of the platinum complex on human embryonic kidney cells HEK293 transfected with human OCT1 HEK hOCT1 and OCT2 HEK hOCT2 versus those that are not transfected. The results indicated that the positively charged complexes are superior substrates for OCT1 and OCT2 than oxaliplatin itself. The ICvalues of these newly synthesized complexes were 20 170 times lower in OCT transfected cell lines when compared with untransfected cells. Cytotoxicities of individual member of platinum complex classes A B and C are listed in table 2 3 and 4. From this preliminary cytotoxicity data the identified lead platinum based compounds as described herein were SM73 and SM85 10 .

Concrete evidence for the higher accumulation of platinum based compounds is obtained through a comparison of the cellular uptake of lead platinum compounds vs. oxaliplatin in OCT1 or OCT2 or OCT3 or NET transfected and untransfected cells. A 50 100 fold higher accumulation of new platinum compounds when compared to the 4.5 fold higher accumulation of oxaliplatin in HEK OCT1 cells than untransfected cells serves to confirm the abovesaid supposition . These experiments clearly demonstrate that platinum based compounds designed to target hOCT1 were far better substrates of hOCT1 when compared to oxaliplatin and could indeed be used as targeted anticancer therapy.

Similar results were obtained for the entire series of our synthetic platinum complexes tables 6 7 and 8 . Also most of these complexes were found to be substrates for OCT2 tables 6 and 7 . This greatly substantiates our original proposition of the stereoelectronic mimicry of the bioactive mono aqua complex to achieve higher affinity for OCTs.

To further support our results from experiments in transfected cell lines we will demonstrate anticancer efficacy of oxaliplatin and these platinum based compounds as described herein in colon cancer cell lines or neuroendocrine cancer cell lines or other cancer cell lines that express and OCT or NET or another transporter that translocates the compounds described herein.

Besides these in vitro experiments which demonstrate the importance of OCT1 in the pharmacological efficacy of these platinums we carried out a mechanistic study whereby we compared the rates of inactivation of these lead synthetic platinums with that of cisplatin and oxaliplatin. One major pathway by which these platinum drugs get inactivated in vivo is by reaction with glutathione GSH . We mimicked this reaction with GSH in vitro using physiological concentrations of GSH and salts. Increase in absorption at 260 nm over period of time was monitored for progress of the reaction and initial rates were calculated from the early time points in terms of the change in absorption over change in time.
