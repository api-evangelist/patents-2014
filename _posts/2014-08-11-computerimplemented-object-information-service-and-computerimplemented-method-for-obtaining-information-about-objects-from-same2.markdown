title: Computer-implemented object information service and computer-implemented method for obtaining information about objects from same
abstract: A computer-implemented method includes obtaining information about an object at a device; providing at least some of the information to an identification mechanism; obtaining an identifier for the object from the identification service; and using the identifier to access and store information about the object at an information mechanism. The information about the object may be determined from at least one image of the object. The information mechanism may include at least one object information application, and the information mechanism may have an Application Program Interface (API) to the at least one object information application, wherein the device uses the identifier to access the at least one object information application via the API. The identifier may be a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that is resolvable to the information mechanism.
