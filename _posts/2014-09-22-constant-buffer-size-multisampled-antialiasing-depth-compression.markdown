In graphics processing the depths of objects within a depiction may be coded. Advantageously the coding used for the depth information is compressed so that the depth buffer size is reduced saving costs.

In some cases a single depth value is used for each pixel. In other cases called multi sampled anti aliasing multiple depth values are used for each pixel. In this case there may be some number of samples per pixel and there may be a depth value associated with each of those samples.

The problem that arises with depth compression for multi sampled anti aliasing is that the size of the depth buffer increases with increasing numbers of samples. Since more samples is generally desirable and because the cost of a depth buffer increases with increasing size there is a need for ways to store information with increasing numbers of samples without excessively increasing the depth buffer cost.

The more samples that are involved the more depth values that have been traditionally used to process a single pixel. Each sample has an individual depth value that is stored in a depth buffer. By packing the depth data in a way that is independent of the number of samples so that memory bandwidth is the same regardless of the number of samples higher numbers of samples per pixel may be used without adversely affecting buffer cost. In some embodiments the number of pixels per clock in a first level depth test may be increased by operating in the pixel domain whereas previous solutions operated at the sample level.

The depth values may be stored in one of two ways while in both cases the size of the depth buffer storage is independent of the number of samples. Specifically the depth values may be stored either as plane equations or by storing a minimum and maximum value for a group of pixels each pixel having multiple samples. Both methods of storage plane equation and minimum and maximum values for a group of pixels may be used within the same compressed depth buffer depending on the continuity of the depth data. As used herein the continuity of the depth data indicates whether or not all the pixels and all the samples for a given group or chunk of data are lit. The term lit means that all the pixels have a sample with a specified color value and all the samples and all the pixels are actually used in the depicted image. For example in some depictions a line that is depicted may go through only part of a pixel so that some of the samples associated with the pixel are lit and others are not.

As used herein portions of a frame including a large number of pixels are treated as a group. For example in one embodiment a 4 8 group of pixels may be treated as a group which is subdividable into two subgroups of 4 4 pixels. The groups of pixels may be manipulated as a whole. However the size of the group and any subgroup may be different from those mentioned herein.

The depth buffer is divided into groups of pixels conveniently defined by a closed rectangular area of pixels and each of these groups is stored using either the plane equation or the minimum and maximum values of the group depending on the continuity of the group. These areas may have constant size in the pixel domain and do not change as the number of samples per pixel is increased in one embodiment. The amount of work performed at a first level depth test maps exactly to the size of the stored chunks and is therefore constant in the pixel domain as the number of samples is increased.

The usage model for integrated graphics is shifting towards high end gaming rather than office and business applications. The gaming applications push towards multi sampling and increased image quality. Enabling increasing numbers of samples per pixel without increasing the memory size or bandwidth may provide more economical solutions in some cases.

In some embodiments a compressed depth buffer stores depth values that are compressed using one of two coding formats. The compressed depth buffer is used for a higher level depth test. In one embodiment this higher level depth test can test a group of pixels in one clock. The data may be arranged to shadow the uncompressed regular depth buffer. The higher level depth test sometimes needs to defer to the lower level depth test when it is not possible to return the same test result for all the pixels in the group.

The data in the compressed depth buffer may be organized using a so called plane bit to indicate its plane in the depth buffer as well as pixel mask information. In the case where the higher level depth test does not return the same result then the lower level depth test may be used and the data may be stored in uncompressed depth buffer. Generally this is undesirable because it is more efficient to store the depth values in the compressed depth buffer if possible.

The first coding format called the minimum maximum format involves storing the minimum and maximum depth values for a group of pixels corresponding to a given region such as a 4 4 or 8 4 group of pixels . These pixels may each consist of multiple samples. The amount of storage however is not dependent on how many samples are used. The compressed representation however is lossy because all of the original per sample data cannot be recovered.

The pixel mask may be part of each entry in the compressed depth buffer. The pixel mask is used to differentiate pixels that are part of a minimum maximum range from pixels that are not stored using a minimum maximum approach. The depth of pixels not included in the minimum maximum range is considered to be equal to the depth buffer clear value. The depth buffer clear value is a starting or default value for all pixels in the buffer at the beginning of a rendering process. The depth values in the depth buffer are cleared to this clear value at the start of each new frame. The clear value can be any value in the range 0 to 1. It is stored on the side as one floating point value global to the entire z buffer.

The pixel mask is set whenever any pixel with at least one sample is lit. When there are partially lit pixels i.e. pixels with not all samples lit drawn on top of the clear buffer a clear value is included in the minimum and maximum range. When partially lit pixels are drawn on top of previously rendered parts of the image the old ranges are incorporated into the new range and written back to the compressed depth buffer.

A partially lit pixel mask takes the logical OR of the samples in the group and the fully lit pixel mask uses the logical AND of the samples in one embodiment.

Thus for the groups that are represented by their minimums and maximums there are basically six cases in one embodiment. When the original or old hierarchical depth HZ mask is read from the compressed depth buffer is all ones and the partially lit source mask for the new data are all ones then the source i.e. new frames range replaces the old range in one embodiment. If both sub groups such as 4 4 areas of pixels are fully lit then the group of pixels can be represented by its plane equation.

The next case is when the old HZ mask is read from the compressed buffer is all ones for the group but the fully lit mask has at least one zero. This would mean that at least one pixel has at least one sample which is not lit. In this case the new range combines with the old range.

The next case is again when the old mask read from the compressed buffer is all ones and both the fully lit and the partially lit source mask has at least one pixel which is zero. In this case the source range combines with the old range.

The next three cases are all cases in which the old HZ mask read from the compressed buffer is all zeroes. In the first of these three cases both the fully lit and the partially lit source masks are all ones. Then the source range replaces the clear values. If both 4 4 groups of pixels are fully lit then the group of pixels can be represented by its plane equation.

The next instance for the old mask having all zeroes is where the fully lit source mask has at least one pixel that is zero and the partially lit source mask has all ones. In this case the source range combines with the clear value.

The final and third instance where the original mask is all zeroes is the case where the fully lit source mask and the partially lit source mask have zeroes. In this case the source range replaces the old range.

The plane equation may be used to represent a group of pixels when the entire group of pixels is lit. Then the exact depth data for all the samples can be found by evaluating the plane equation where the depth value Z is equal to Z x CX y CY where CX is the x coordinate of the depth value and CY is its y coordinate. The xy coordinates can be fractional giving an exact depth of the samples within each pixel.

This plane equation also uses a fixed amount of storage that is not dependent on the number of samples. It is written back to the compressed buffer whenever the entire group of pixels passes the depth test. All samples for all pixels are lit and no further pixel test in the pipeline can discard any pixels.

Both formats include the plane bit in the same most significant bit position in one embodiment. The plane bit tells the hardware how to interpret the data that follows. The higher level depth test is more accurate whenever the input is in the plane format. The higher level depth test sometimes needs to fall back on the lower level depth test when the input format is in the minimum and maximum format.

Referring to a group composed a 8 4 chunk of data made up of two 4 4 chunks of data is depicted. In this example the minimum maximum format is used when the depth data is not continuous and so it is not representable by a single plane equation. In this case the minimum maximum format takes up 64 bits of data regardless of the number of samples. The first 16 bits are for the pixel mask the next 24 bits may be used for the maximum depth value the next 23 bits may be used for the minimum depth value and the last bit may be the plane bit for each 4 4 chunk in one embodiment.

In contrast as shown in an 8 4 chunk of pixels is stored in the plane equation format which takes up 128 bits of storage in this example. This corresponds to the same amount of data as two minimum maximum format slots of 4 4 size. In this case the first 32 bits are for the CY coefficient the next 32 bits are for the CX coefficient the next 31 bits are for the CO coefficient and the last bit is for the plane bit. Other organizations of the bits may also be used. The plane format is used when the data in continuous and occupies the same space as two minimum maximum format 4 4 slots.

The storage requirements of the compressed depth buffer remain constant with respect to the amount of samples used to render each pixel.

Referring to a depth buffering scheme may receive data for depth buffer testing from a rasterizer . First the data from the rasterizer is subjected to the higher level depth test at . Data may be stored in compressed format in the compressed depth buffer . If the higher level depth test does not work then the lower level depth test must be used and the data stored in a regular uncompressed depth buffer .

The sequence of may be used for the higher level depth test. The depth values are received at block for a group of pixels. Each pixel consisting of multiple samples. A check at diamond determines whether the data is continuous. If so the data may be represented as a plane equation and stored as indicated in block in the compressed depth buffer. Otherwise the data may be stored as two minimum maximum chunks as indicated in block .

Referring to the sequence for the minimum maximum storage technique is depicted according to one embodiment. Initially a check at diamond determines whether the source mask is not lit. If so the old minimum and maximum range is maintained as indicated in block .

If the source mask is not lit then a check at diamond determines whether the source mask is fully lit. If so the old range is replaced with the source s minimum and maximum range as indicated in block . If not a check at diamond determines whether the source mask has partially lit pixels.

If so a check at diamond determines whether any partial pixel overlaps with zero in a destination mask. If not the old range is combined with the source range as indicated in block .

If the check at diamond determines that the source mask does not have partially lit pixels then a check at diamond determines whether any unlit source pixel overlaps with a lit destination pixel. If so the flow goes to block combining the old range with the source range. Otherwise the old range is replaced with the source minimum maximum range in block .

If the check at diamond determines that any pixel does overlap with zero in the destination mask then a check at diamond determines whether any partial pixel overlaps with a lit destination pixel. If so the old range clear value and source range are combined at block . Otherwise the old range is replaced with the combination of the source range and the clear range at block .

Then in any case a new HZ mask is a logical OR of the old mask and the source mask. The masks are one bit per pixel. In an multi sampled anti aliasing mode partially lit pixels are treated as lit as indicated in block .

The graphics processor includes scalable thread execution resources featuring modular cores A N sometime referred to as core slices each having multiple sub cores A N A N sometimes referred to as core sub slices . The graphics processor can have any number of graphics cores A through N. In one embodiment the graphics processor includes a graphics core A having at least a first sub core A and a second core sub core A. In another embodiment the graphics processor is a low power processor with a single sub core e.g. A . In one embodiment the graphics processor includes multiple graphics cores A N each including a set of first sub cores A N and a set of second sub cores A N. Each sub core in the set of first sub cores A N includes at least a first set of execution units A N and media texture samplers A N. Each sub core in the set of second sub cores A N includes at least a second set of execution units A N and samplers A N. In one embodiment each sub core A N A N shares a set of shared resources A N. In one embodiment the shared resources include shared cache memory and pixel operation logic. Other shared resources may also be included in the various embodiments of the graphics processor.

In one embodiment the execution unit array A N is primarily used to execute shader programs. In one embodiment the execution units in the array A N execute an instruction set that includes native support for many standard 3D graphics shader instructions such that shader programs from graphics libraries e.g. Direct 3D and OpenGL are executed with a minimal translation. The execution units support vertex and geometry processing e.g. vertex programs geometry programs vertex shaders pixel processing e.g. pixel shaders fragment shaders and general purpose processing e.g. compute and media shaders .

Each execution unit in the execution unit array A N operates on arrays of data elements. The number of data elements is the execution size or the number of channels for the instruction. An execution channel is a logical unit of execution for data element access masking and flow control within instructions. The number of channels may be independent of the number of physical ALUs or FPUs for a particular graphics processor. The execution units A N support integer and floating point data types.

The execution unit instruction set includes single instruction multiple data SIMD instructions. The various data elements can be stored as a packed data type in a register and the execution unit will process the various elements based on the data size of the elements. For example when operating on a 256 bit wide vector the 256 bits of the vector are stored in a register and the execution unit operates on the vector as four separate 64 bit packed data elements quad word QW size data elements eight separate 32 bit packed data elements double word DW size data elements sixteen separate 16 bit packed data elements word W size data elements or thirty two separate 8 bit data elements byte B size data elements . However different vector widths and register sizes are possible.

One or more internal instruction caches e.g. are included in the thread execution logic to cache thread instructions for the execution units. In one embodiment one or more data caches e.g. are included to cache thread data during thread execution. A sampler is included to provide texture sampling for 3D operations and media sampling for media operations. In one embodiment the sampler includes specialized texture or media sampling functionality to process texture or media data during the sampling process before providing the sampled data to an execution unit.

During execution the graphics and media pipelines send thread initiation requests to the thread execution logic via thread spawning and dispatch logic. The thread execution logic includes a local thread dispatcher that arbitrates thread initiation requests from the graphics and media pipelines and instantiates the requested threads on one or more execution units A N. For example the geometry pipeline e.g. of dispatches vertex processing tessellation or geometry processing threads to the thread execution logic . The thread dispatcher can also process runtime thread spawning requests from the executing shader programs.

Once a group of geometric objects have been processed and rasterized into pixel data the pixel shader is invoked to further compute output information and cause results to be written to output surfaces e.g. color buffers depth buffers stencil buffers etc. . In one embodiment the pixel shader calculates the values of the various vertex attributes that are to be interpolated across the rasterized object. The pixel shader then executes an API supplied pixel shader program. To execute the pixel shader program the pixel shader dispatches threads to an execution unit e.g. A via the thread dispatcher . The pixel shader uses texture sampling logic in the sampler to access texture data in texture maps stored in memory. Arithmetic operations on the texture data and the input geometry data compute pixel color data for each geometric fragment or discards one or more pixels from further processing.

In one embodiment the data port provides a memory access mechanism for the thread execution logic output processed data to memory for processing on a graphics processor output pipeline. In one embodiment the data port includes or couples to one or more cache memories e.g. data cache to cache data for memory access via the data port.

In one embodiment the graphics processor execution units natively support instructions in a 128 bit format . A 64 bit compacted instruction format is available for some instructions based on the selected instruction instruction options and number of operands. The native 128 bit format provides access to all instruction options while some options and operations are restricted in the 64 bit format . The native instructions available in the 64 bit format varies by embodiment. In one embodiment the instruction is compacted in part using a set of index values in an index field . The execution unit hardware references a set of compaction tables based on the index values and uses the compaction table outputs to reconstruct a native instruction in the 128 bit format .

For each format an instruction opcode defines the operation that the execution unit is to perform. The execution units execute each instruction in parallel across the multiple data elements of each operand. For example in response to an add instruction the execution unit performs a simultaneous add operation across each color channel representing a texture element or picture element. By default the execution unit performs each instruction across all data channels of the operands. An instruction control field enables control over certain execution options such as channels selection e.g. predication and data channel order e.g. swizzle . For 128 bit instructions an exec size field limits the number of data channels that will be executed in parallel. The exec size field is not available for use in the 64 bit compact instruction format .

Some execution unit instructions have up to three operands including two source operands src src and one destination . In one embodiment the execution units support dual destination instructions where one of the destinations is implied. Data manipulation instructions can have a third source operand e.g. SRC where the instruction opcode JJ12 determines the number of source operands. An instruction s last source operand can be an immediate e.g. hard coded value passed with the instruction.

In one embodiment instructions are grouped based on opcode bit fields to simplify Opcode decode . For an 8 bit opcode bits and allow the execution unit to determine the type of opcode. The precise opcode grouping shown is exemplary. In one embodiment a move and logic opcode group includes data movement and logic instructions e.g. mov cmp . The move and logic group shares the five most significant bits MSB where move instructions are in the form of 0000xxxxb e.g. 0x0x and logic instructions are in the form of 0001xxxxb e.g. 0x01 . A flow control instruction group e.g. call jmp includes instructions in the form of 0010xxxxb e.g. 0x20 . A miscellaneous instruction group includes a mix of instructions including synchronization instructions e.g. wait send in the form of 0011xxxxb e.g. 0x30 . A parallel math instruction group includes component wise arithmetic instructions e.g. add mul in the form of 0100xxxxb e.g. 0x40 . The parallel math group performs the arithmetic operations in parallel across data channels. The vector math group includes arithmetic instructions e.g. dp4 in the form of 0101xxxxb e.g. 0x50 . The vector math group performs arithmetic such as dot product calculations on vector operands.

The command streamer directs the operation of a vertex fetcher component that reads vertex data from memory and executes vertex processing commands provided by the command streamer . The vertex fetcher provides vertex data to a vertex shader which performs coordinate space transformation and lighting operations to each vertex. The vertex fetcher and vertex shader execute vertex processing instructions by dispatching execution threads to the execution units A B via a thread dispatcher .

In one embodiment the execution units A B are an array of vector processors having an instruction set for performing graphics and media operations. The execution units A B have an attached L1 cache that is specific for each array or shared between the arrays. The cache can be configured as a data cache an instruction cache or a single cache that is partitioned to contain data and instructions in different partitions.

In one embodiment the graphics pipeline includes tessellation components to perform hardware accelerated tessellation of 3D objects. A programmable hull shader configures the tessellation operations. A programmable domain shader provides back end evaluation of tessellation output. A tessellator operates at the direction of the hull shader and contains special purpose logic to generate a set of detailed geometric objects based on a coarse geometric model that is provided as input to the graphics pipeline . If tessellation is not used the tessellation components can be bypassed.

The complete geometric objects can be processed by a geometry shader via one or more threads dispatched to the execution units A B or can proceed directly to the clipper . The geometry shader operates on entire geometric objects rather than vertices or patches of vertices as in previous stages of the graphics pipeline. If the tessellation is disabled the geometry shader receives input from the vertex shader . The geometry shader is programmable by a geometry shader program to perform geometry tessellation if the tessellation units are disabled.

Prior to rasterization vertex data is processed by a clipper which is either a fixed function clipper or a programmable clipper having clipping and geometry shader functions. In one embodiment a rasterizer in the render output pipeline dispatches pixel shaders to convert the geometric objects into their per pixel representations. In one embodiment pixel shader logic is included in the thread execution logic .

The graphics engine has an interconnect bus interconnect fabric or some other interconnect mechanism that allows data and message passing amongst the major components of the graphics engine. In one embodiment the execution units A B and associated cache s texture and media sampler and texture sampler cache interconnect via a data port to perform memory access and communicate with render output pipeline components of the graphics engine. In one embodiment the sampler caches and execution units A B each have separate memory access paths.

In one embodiment the render output pipeline contains a rasterizer and depth test component that converts vertex based objects into their associated pixel based representation. In one embodiment the rasterizer logic includes a windower masker unit to perform fixed function triangle and line rasterization. An associated render and depth buffer caches are also available in one embodiment. A pixel operations component performs pixel based operations on the data though in some instances pixel operations associated with 2D operations e.g. bit block image transfers with blending are performed by the 2D engine or substituted at display time by the display controller using overlay display planes. In one embodiment a shared L3 cache is available to all graphics components allowing the sharing of data without the use of main system memory.

The graphics processor media pipeline includes a media engine and a video front end . In one embodiment the video front end receives pipeline commands from the command streamer . However in one embodiment the media pipeline includes a separate command streamer. The video front end processes media commands before sending the command to the media engine . In one embodiment the media engine includes thread spawning functionality to spawn threads for dispatch to the thread execution logic via the thread dispatcher .

In one embodiment the graphics engine includes a display engine . In one embodiment the display engine is external to the graphics processor and couples with the graphics processor via the ring interconnect or some other interconnect bus or fabric. The display engine includes a 2D engine and a display controller . The display engine contains special purpose logic capable of operating independently of the 3D pipeline. The display controller couples with a display device not shown which may be a system integrated display device as in a laptop computer or an external display device attached via an display device connector.

The graphics pipeline and media pipeline are configurable to perform operations based on multiple graphics and media programming interfaces and are not specific to any one application programming interface API . In one embodiment driver software for the graphics processor translates API calls that are specific to a particular graphics or media library into commands that can be processed by the graphics processor. In various embodiments support is provided for the Open Graphics Library OpenGL and Open Computing Language OpenCL supported by the Khronos Group the Direct3D library from the Microsoft Corporation or in one embodiment both OpenGL and D3D. Support may also be provided for the Open Source Computer Vision Library OpenCV . A future API with a compatible 3D pipeline would also be supported if a mapping can be made from the pipeline of the future API to the pipeline of the graphics processor.

The client specifies the client unit of the graphics device that processes the command data. In one embodiment a graphics processor command parser examines the client field of each command to condition the further processing of the command and route the command data to the appropriate client unit. In one embodiment the graphics processor client units include a memory interface unit a render unit a 2D unit a 3D unit and a media unit. Each client unit has a corresponding processing pipeline that processes the commands. Once the command is received by the client unit the client unit reads the opcode and if present sub opcode to determine the operation to perform. The client unit performs the command using information in the data field of the command. For some commands an explicit command size is expected to specify the size of the command. In one embodiment the command parser automatically determines the size of at least some of the commands based on the command opcode. In one embodiment commands are aligned via multiples of a double word.

The flow chart in shows a sample command sequence . In one embodiment software or firmware of a data processing system that features an embodiment of the graphics processor uses a version of the command sequence shown to set up execute and terminate a set of graphics operations. A sample command sequence is shown and described for exemplary purposes however embodiments are not limited to these commands or to this command sequence. Moreover the commands may be issued as batch of commands in a command sequence such that the graphics processor will process the sequence of commands in an at least partially concurrent manner.

The sample command sequence may begin with a pipeline flush command to cause any active graphics pipeline to complete the currently pending commands for the pipeline. In one embodiment the 3D pipeline and the media pipeline do not operate concurrently. The pipeline flush is performed to cause the active graphics pipeline to complete any pending commands. In response to a pipeline flush the command parser for the graphics processor will pause command processing until the active drawing engines complete pending operations and the relevant read caches are invalidated. Optionally any data in the render cache that is marked dirty can be flushed to memory. A pipeline flush command can be used for pipeline synchronization or before placing the graphics processor into a low power state.

A pipeline select command is used when a command sequence requires the graphics processor to explicitly switch between pipelines. A pipeline select command is required only once within an execution context before issuing pipeline commands unless the context is to issue commands for both pipelines. In one embodiment a pipeline flush command is is required immediately before a pipeline switch via the pipeline select command .

A pipeline control command configures a graphics pipeline for operation and is used to program the 3D pipeline and the media pipeline . The pipeline control command configures the pipeline state for the active pipeline. In one embodiment the pipeline control command is used for pipeline synchronization and to clear data from one or more cache memories within the active pipeline before processing a batch of commands.

Return buffer state commands are used to configure a set of return buffers for the respective pipelines to write data. Some pipeline operations require the allocation selection or configuration of one or more return buffers into which the operations write intermediate data during processing. The graphics processor also uses one or more return buffers to store output data and to perform cross thread communication. The return buffer state includes selecting the size and number of return buffers to use for a set of pipeline operations.

The remaining commands in the command sequence differ based on the active pipeline for operations. Based on a pipeline determination the command sequence is tailored to the 3D pipeline beginning with the 3D pipeline state or the media pipeline beginning at the media pipeline state .

The commands for the 3D pipeline state include 3D state setting commands for vertex buffer state vertex element state constant color state depth buffer state and other state variables that are to be configured before 3D primitive commands are processed. The values of these commands are determined at least in part based the particular 3D API in use. 3D pipeline state commands are also able to selectively disable or bypass certain pipeline elements if those elements will not be used.

The 3D primitive command is used to submit 3D primitives to be processed by the 3D pipeline. Commands and associated parameters that are passed to the graphics processor via the 3D primitive command are forwarded to the vertex fetch function in the graphics pipeline. The vertex fetch function uses the 3D primitive command data to generate vertex data structures. The vertex data structures are stored in one or more return buffers. The 3D primitive command is used to perform vertex operations on 3D primitives via vertex shaders. To process vertex shaders the 3D pipeline dispatches shader execution threads to graphics processor execution units.

The 3D pipeline is triggered via an execute command or event. In one embodiment a register write triggers command execution. In one embodiment execution is triggered via a go or kick command in the command sequence. In one embodiment command execution is triggered using a pipeline synchronization command to flush the command sequence through the graphics pipeline. The 3D pipeline will perform geometry processing for the 3D primitives. Once operations are complete the resulting geometric objects are rasterized and the pixel engine colors the resulting pixels. Additional commands to control pixel shading and pixel back end operations may also be included for those operations.

The sample command sequence follows the media pipeline path when performing media operations. In general the specific use and manner of programming for the media pipeline depends on the media or compute operations to be performed. Specific media decode operations may be offloaded to the media pipeline during media decode. The media pipeline can also be bypassed and media decode can be performed in whole or in part using resources provided by one or more general purpose processing cores. In one embodiment the media pipeline also includes elements for general purpose graphics processor unit GPGPU operations where the graphics processor is used to perform SIMD vector operations using computational shader programs that are not explicitly related to the rendering of graphics primitives.

The media pipeline is configured in a similar manner as the 3D pipeline . A set of media pipeline state commands are dispatched or placed into in a command queue before the media object commands . The media pipeline state commands include data to configure the media pipeline elements that will be used to process the media objects. This includes data to configure the video decode and video encode logic within the media pipeline such as encode or decode format. The media pipeline state commands also support the use one or more pointers to indirect state elements that contain a batch of state settings.

Media object commands supply pointers to media objects for processing by the media pipeline. The media objects include memory buffers containing video data to be processed. In one embodiment all media pipeline state must be valid before issuing a media object command . Once the pipeline state is configured and media object commands are queued the media pipeline is triggered via an execute command or an equivalent execute event e.g. register write . Output from the media pipeline may then be post processed by operations provided by the 3D pipeline or the media pipeline . In one embodiment GPGPU operations are configured and executed in a similar manner as media operations.

In one embodiment the 3D graphics application contains one or more shader programs including shader instructions . The shader language instructions may be in a high level shader language such as the High Level Shader Language HLSL or the OpenGL Shader Language GLSL . The application also includes executable instructions in a machine language suitable for execution by the general purpose processor core . The application also includes graphics objects defined by vertex data.

The operating system may be a Microsoft Windows operating system from the Microsoft Corporation a proprietary UNIX like operating system or an open source UNIX like operating system using a variant of the Linux kernel. When the Direct3D API is in use the operating system uses a front end shader compiler to compile any shader instructions in HLSL into a lower level shader language. The compilation may be a just in time compilation or the application can perform share pre compilation. In one embodiment high level shaders are compiled into low level shaders during the compilation of the 3D graphics application .

The user mode graphics driver may contain a back end shader compiler to convert the shader instructions into a hardware specific representation. When the OpenGL API is in use shader instructions in the GLSL high level language are passed to a user mode graphics driver for compilation. The user mode graphics driver uses operating system kernel mode functions to communicate with a kernel mode graphics driver . The kernel mode graphics driver communicates with the graphics processor to dispatch commands and instructions.
