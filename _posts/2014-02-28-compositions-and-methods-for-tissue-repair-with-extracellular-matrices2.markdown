This application is a continuation of PCT Application No. PCT US2012 054058 which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 531 931 filed Sep. 7 2011 the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herewith.

This invention was made with government support under grant No. OD004309 awarded by National Institutes of Health NIH . The government has certain rights in the invention.

Peripheral artery disease PAD is a common condition in which blood flow is reduced to the limbs typically the leg and feet Manzi et al. 2011 Stansby and Williams 2011 and if untreated may progress to the stage of critical limb ischemia CLI which is the most advanced form of PAD often leading to amputation of the limb and potential mortality Chan and Cheng 2011 Dattilo and Casserly 2011 . Similar to myocardial infarction MI which is also a result of atherosclerosis PAD has a large population of affected individuals with an estimated 27 million suffering from PAD in Europe and North America Belch et al. 2003 . Despite recent medical advances and the advent of tissue engineering strategies revascularization through surgical or endovascular intervention remains the only treatment. This is further complicated by the fact that approximately 40 of patients with critical limb ischemia CLI are not candidates for revascularization procedures Sprengers et al. 2008 and that revascularization has limited benefit when the PAD is diffuse or below the knee. This corresponds to approximately 120 000 leg amputations in the US and 100 000 in the European Union each year Lawall et al. 2010 . There is therefore a pressing need for the development of new therapies for treating PAD and CLI.

Alternative therapies for PAD and CLI have largely mirrored the attempts for MI and heart failure including cell transplantation and angiogenic growth factor therapy Fadini et al. 2010 Menasche 2010 Tongers et al. 2008 . The goal of these therapies has been to increase vascularization of the ischemic limb so that perfusion is sufficient for wound healing to occur and to resolve pain at rest thereby also preventing limb amputations. Biomaterial based strategies have recently been explored. Currently only poly d l lactide co glycolide PLGA collagen fibronectin alginate gelatin fibrin and peptide amphiphiles have been examined Doi et al. 2007 Jay et al. 2008 Kong et al. 2008 Layman et al. 2007 Lee et al. 2010 Ruvinov et al. 2010 Silva and Mooney 2007 Webber et al. 2011 . PLGA microspheres in alginate hydrogels have been utilized to deliver vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF Lee et al. 2010 and alginate hydrogels have been explored for delivery of hepatocyte growth factor HGF Ruvinov et al. 2010 VEGF Silva and Mooney 2007 and pDNA encoding for VEGF Kong et al. 2008 . Alginate microspheres within an injectable collagen matrix have also been used to deliver stromal cell derived factor 1 SDF 1 Kuraitis et al. 2011 while VEGF loaded alginate microparticles in a collagen fibronectin scaffold were used to deliver endothelial cells Jay et al. 2008 . Gelatin hydrogels have been employed to deliver basic fibroblast growth factor bFGF Doi et al. 2007 Layman et al. 2007 and fibrin scaffolds were utilized to deliver bFGF and granulocyte colony stimulating factor G CSF along with bone marrow cells. More recently VEGF mimetic peptides were delivered using assembling peptide amphiphiles Webber et al. 2011 . Each of these studies demonstrated enhanced cell transplantation and or enhanced growth factor gene delivery with resulting enhancements in neovascularization.

While each of the materials currently explored for treating PAD have been used extensively as tissue engineering scaffolds they do not mimic the extracellular microenvironment of the skeletal muscle they are intended to treat.

Recently several clinical trials using cell therapy have demonstrated promising results Alev et al. 2011 Gupta and Losordo 2011 Kawamoto et al. 2009 Menasche 2010 but there are still many questions about which therapeutic cell type to use quantity of cells and best route to deliver the cells as well as a significant problem with poor cell retention and survival Menasch 2010 . Biomaterial scaffolds have more recently been explored to enhance cell survival by providing a temporary mimic of the extracellular matrix ECM Kawamoto et al. 2009 Layman et al. 2011 . Biomaterials have also been used for delivery of growth factors or their mimics in animal models of PAD and CLI Kawamoto et al. 2009 Layman et al. 2011 Ruvinov et al. 2010 Webber et al. 2011 . However these scaffolds are composed of fibrin Layman et al. 2011 collagen based matrix Kuraitis et al. 2011 gelatin Layman et al. 2007 self assembling peptide amphiphiles Webber et al. 2011 or alginate Ruvinov et al. 2010 which may not provide the proper biomimetic environment for the ischemic skeletal muscle in these conditions. Moreover no potential therapies employing only a biomaterial have been explored to date. An acellular biomaterial only approach may reach the clinic sooner since it has the potential to be an off the shelf treatment and does not have the added complications that cells bring including appropriate source the need for expansion or potential disease transmission. Furthermore a biomaterial that promotes neovascularization and tissue repair on its own would obviate the need for exogenous growth factors and the difficulties and expense associated with such a combination product.

The extracellular matrix ECM of each tissue contains similar components however each individual tissue is composed of a unique combination of proteins and proteoglycans Lutolf and Hubbell 2005 Uriel et al. 2009 . Recent studies have shown that the ECM of various tissues can be isolated through decellularization and utilized as a tissue engineering scaffold Merritt et al. Ott et al. 2008 Singelyn et al. 2009 Uygun et al. 2010 Valentin et al. 2010 Young et al. 2011 . Other decellularized ECM materials have been used for a variety of applications for tissue repair Crapo et al. 2011 Gilbert et al. 2006 . These scaffolds are known to promote cellular influx in a variety of tissues Numata et al. 2004 Rieder et al. 2006 . Their degradation products have angiogenic Li et al. 2004 and chemoattractant Badylak et al. 2001 Beattie et al. 2008 Li et al. 2004 Zantop et al. 2006 properties and also promote cell migration and proliferation Reing et al. 2009 . After removal of the cellular antigens these scaffolds are considered biocompatible and both allogeneic and xenogeneic ECM devices have been approved by the FDA and are in clinical use Badylak 2007 .

Hydrogels derived from decellularized ECMs including myocardium Singelyn et al. 2009 pericardium Seif Naraghi et al. 2010 and adipose tissue Young et al. 2011 were recently developed which assemble into porous and fibrous scaffolds upon injection in vivo. It is also recently shown that the injectable hydrogel derived from ventricular ECM promoted endogenous cardiomyocyte survival and preserved cardiac function post myocardial infarction Singelyn et al. 2012 .

Skeletal muscles are composed of bundles of highly oriented and dense muscle fibers each a multinucleated cell derived from myoblasts. The muscle fibers in native skeletal muscle are closely packed together in an extracellular three dimensional matrix to form an organized tissue with high cell density and cellular orientation to generate longitudinal contraction. Skeletal muscle can develop scar tissue after injury which leads to a loss of functionality. The engineering of muscle tissue in vitro holds promise for the treatment of skeletal muscle defects as an alternative to host muscle transfer. Tissue engineering compositions must be biocompatible and capable of being vascularised and innervated.

The reconstruction of skeletal muscle which is lost by injury tumor resection or various myopathies is limited by the lack of functional substitutes. Surgical treatments such as muscle transplantation and transposition techniques have had some success however there still exists a need for alternative therapies. Tissue engineering approaches offer potential new solutions however current options offer incomplete regeneration. Many naturally derived as well as synthetic materials have been explored as scaffolds for skeletal tissue engineering but none offer a complex mimic of the native skeletal extracellular matrix which possesses important cues for cell survival differentiation and migration.

The extracellular matrix consists of a complex tissue specific network of proteins and polysaccharides which help regulate cell growth survival and differentiation. Despite the complex nature of native ECM in vitro cell studies traditionally assess cell behavior on single ECM component coatings thus posing limitations on translating findings from in vitro cell studies to the in vivo setting. Overcoming this limitation is important for cell mediated therapies which rely on cultured and expanded cells retaining native cell behavior over time.

Typically purified matrix proteins from various animal sources are adsorbed to cell culture substrates to provide a protein substrate for cell attachment and to modify cellular behavior. However these approaches would not provide an accurate representation of the complex microenvironment. More complex coatings have been used such as a combination of single proteins and while these combinatorial signals have shown to affect cell behavior it is not as complete as in vivo. For a more natural matrix cell derived matrices have been used. Matrigel is a complex system however it is derived from mouse sarcoma and does not mimic any natural tissue. While many components of ECM are similar each tissue or organ has a unique composition and a tissue specific naturally derived source may prove to be a better mimic of the cell microenvironment.

A liquid form of skeletal muscle matrix was shown to promote the differentiation and maturation of C2C12 skeletal myoblast progenitors when used as a cell culture coating due to its ability to retain a complex mixture of skeletal muscle ECM proteins peptides and proteoglycans DeQuach et al. 2010 . A decellularized skeletal muscle scaffold has been previously explored for replacement of a muscle defect Merritt et al. Wolf et al. 2012 yet this intact scaffold would not be amenable to treating certain non skeletal muscle tissue disease such as the peripheral artery disease PAD and CLI.

As discussed above the only current clinical treatment for PAD and CLI is endovascular or surgical revascularization Dattilo and Casserly 2011 . Surgical bypass was the established standard but recently endovascular therapies such as angioplasty atherectomy and stenting are used as less invasive options. However despite these therapies CLI continues to carry a major risk of limb amputation with rates that have not changed significantly in 30 years Tongers et al. 2008 . Unfortunately few therapies exist for treating the ischemic skeletal muscle in these conditions. Biomaterials have been used to increase cell transplant survival as well as deliver growth factors to treat limb ischemia however existing materials do not mimic the native skeletal muscle microenvironment they are intended to treat. Furthermore no therapies involving biomaterials alone have been examined.

To produce a gel form of the skeletal muscle extracellular matrix for in vivo therapy the solution comprising the skeletal muscle extracellular matrix is then neutralized and brought up to the desired temperature concentration and viscosity using PBS saline. In certain embodiments the ECM concentration can be 1 20 mg mL or 2 8 mg mL. The solution comprising the skeletal muscle extracellular matrix can then be injected through a high gauge needle such as 27 gauge or higher into the injured tissue or any tissue in need. At body temperature e.g. 36.8 C. 0.7 C. such solution then forms into a gel. Cells drugs proteins or other therapeutic agents can also be delivered inside the skeletal muscle ECM gel.

In an embodiment herein a biomimetic ECM derived from native skeletal muscle tissue is disclosed. In some instances a matrix resembles the in vivo skeletal muscle or other relevant tissue environment in that it contains many or all of the native chemical cues found in natural skeletal muscle ECM. In some instances through crosslinking or addition or other materials the mechanical properties of healthy adult or embryonic skeletal muscle can also be mimicked.

In some instances a composition as provided herein can comprise a matrix and exogenously added or recruited cells. The cells can be any variety of cells. In some instances the cells are a variety of skeletal muscle or relevant cells including but not limited to stem cells progenitors skeletal muscle precursor cells and fibroblasts derived from autologous or allogeneic sources.

The invention thus provides a use of a gel made from native decellularized skeletal muscle extracellular matrix to support isolated neonatal skeletal muscle or stem cell progenitor derived skeletal muscle cells in vitro and to act as an in situ gelling scaffold providing a natural matrix to improve cell retention and muscle mass restoration. A scaffold created from skeletal muscle ECM is well suited for cell transplantation in the injured tissue since it more closely approximates the in vivo environment compared to currently available materials.

A composition herein comprising skeletal muscle ECM and exogenously added cells can be prepared by culturing the cells in the ECM. In addition where proteins such as growth factors are added into the extracellular matrix the proteins may be added into the composition or the protein molecules may be covalently or non covalently linked to a molecule in the matrix.

The adult mammal provides sources for adult stem cells in circulating endothelial precursor cells bone marrow derived cells adipose tissue or cells from a specific organ. It is known that mononuclear cells isolated from bone marrow aspirate differentiate into endothelial cells in vitro and are detected in newly formed blood vessels after intramuscular injection. Thus use of cells from bone marrow aspirate can yield endothelial cells in vivo as a component of the composition. Other cells which can be employed with the invention are the mesenchymal stem cells administered with activating cytokines.

In some instances the composition is injectable. An injectable composition can be without limitation a powder liquid particles fragments gel or emulsion. The injectable composition can be injected into an injured tissue or organ. The compositions herein can recruit for example without limitation endothelial smooth muscle skeletal muscle progenitors and stem cells.

The composition of the present invention can be developed for substrate coating for a variety of applications. In some instances the ECM of the composition retains a complex mixture of muscle specific ECM components after solubilization. In some instances the coatings herein can more appropriately emulate the native muscle ECM in vitro.

In some instances a composition herein is a coating. The coating can comprise an ECM from any tissue for example cardiac muscle skeletal muscle pericardium liver adipose tissue and brain.

In some instances a composition herein is configured to seal holes in the heart such as septal defects. The compositions of the present invention may be used as coating for biologics medical devices or drug delivery devices.

The native ECM is a complex combination of fibrous proteins and proteoglycans that can affect many aspects of cellular behavior. To regenerate tissue a scaffold should mimic this native microenvironment. The present invention therefore provides an injectable hydrogel derived from skeletal muscle ECM which mimics the native biochemical cues as well as being amenable to minimally invasive injectable procedures providing an advantage for treating PAD and CLI. In certain embodiments the invention can be used as a delivery vehicle combined with cells and or growth factors. In certain embodiments of the invention the compositions and methods herein provide skeletal muscle ECM material as an acellular stand alone therapy which is used to recruit endogenous cells for neovascularization and repair. In certain embodiments the present invention provides a porcine source of skeletal muscle matrix. Xenogeneic decellularized extracellular matrices are biocompatible upon removal of the cellular antigens and can be utilized in the clinic for a number of surgical repair applications.

A liquid version of skeletal muscle matrix herein can form a porous scaffold upon injection which promotes cellular infiltration to the damaged area. In certain embodiments remnant growth factors are present. In other embodiments remnant growth factors are not present. In methods herein the decellularization and subsequent processing into the hydrogel form decreases the probability of the presence of remnant growth factors.

In the present invention mitogenic properties of the degradation products of the skeletal muscle ECM material were assessed on smooth muscle cells a relevant cell type for vascularization. The skeletal muscle matrix degradation fragments induced a higher proliferation rate compared to collagen. Extracellular matrix degradation products sometimes have mitogenic activity. The examples herein provide evidence that the injectable skeletal muscle matrix scaffold induces neovascularization in vivo.

Therefore the ability of this present scaffold to induce neovascularization was then assessed in a rat hindlimb ischemia model compared to collagen which is the predominant component of the skeletal muscle matrix and a commonly utilized scaffold. Not only was the vessel density higher in the skeletal muscle matrix but there were significantly more large diameter vessels greater than 25 m indicating maturation of the vasculature. Additionally significance was seen as early as three days post injection demonstrating the fast rate of vascularization. In PAD the formation of new blood vessels is critical to treat the ischemic tissue. The presence of more mature vasculature indicates permanence of the formed vessels which is important to getting a vascular supply as quickly as possible to the ischemic region and to maintain blood flow Banker and Goslin 1998 .

In addition to treating the ischemic environment increasing muscle mass is beneficial in a therapy for PAD and CLI as patients often suffer with muscle fatigue and atrophy. In certain embodiments the liquid form of decellularized skeletal muscle when utilized as a coating for cell culture increased skeletal myoblast differentiation compared to collagen coatings. In certain embodiments the composition provides tissue specific biochemical cues to recapitulate the skeletal muscle microenvironment. The invention demonstrated that the degradation products of this scaffold increased myoblast proliferation compared to collagen which is consistent with literature demonstrating the inhibitory effect of collagen on smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts Koyama et al. 1996 Rhudy and McPherson 1988 .

Next the infiltration of muscle cells into the scaffold in the hindlimb ischemia model was assessed. The number of desmin and MyoD positive cells that were recruited into the skeletal muscle matrix scaffold was measured as compared to that into the collagen. Desmin a muscle specific protein confirms that the cells that infiltrated were from a myogenic origin. MyoD on the other hand is a specific striated muscle regulatory transcription factor which coordinates the myogenic program in differentiating myoblasts Kanisicak et al. 2009 Lee et al. 2000 Wada et al. 2002 . The invention provides that there were a significantly higher number of muscle cell types in the skeletal muscle matrix and that many of these cells were also proliferating. The MyoD positive cells also indicate that immature progenitor cell types are recruited to the skeletal muscle matrix. The presence of these MyoD positive and desmin positive muscle cells indicate that the skeletal muscle scaffold is recruiting relevant cell types that aid in the regeneration of the damaged muscle in addition to treating the ischemic tissue.

The present invention thus provides an acellular biomaterial only therapy for treating PAD. Previous biomaterial strategies for PAD have only utilized scaffolds to enhance cell or growth factor therapy Doi et al. 2007 Jay et al. 2008 Kong et al. 2008 Layman et al. 2007 Lee et al. 2010 Ruvinov et al. 2010 Silva and Mooney 2007 . To increase its therapeutic benefit the invention can be used in conjunction with cell or growth factor therapy as these components can be added to the biomaterial prior to injection. To create a material that could be easily prepared in the clinic a method that allowed for long term storage of the injectable skeletal muscle matrix scaffold was also developed with only sterile water required to resuspend it immediately prior to use.

The invention is further illustrated by the following examples which are not to be construed in any way as imposing limitations upon the scope thereof. It is apparent for skilled artisans that various modifications and changes are possible and are contemplated within the scope of the current invention.

Skeletal muscle matrix material was derived through decellularization of porcine skeletal muscle tissue . Fat and connective tissue was removed and the skeletal muscle was cut into 1 cmpieces rinsed with deioninized water and stirred in 1 wt vol solution of SDS in PBS for 4 5 days. The decellularized muscle was then stirred overnight in deionized water and agitated rinses under running deionized water were performed to remove residual SDS. In addition to confirmation with lack of nuclei on H E stained sections not shown the DNA content of the material was measured as 26.14 1.67 ng of DNA mg of dry weight ECM which confirmed decellularization. The matrix was then lyophilized and milled into a fine particulate. At this stage the material can be hydrated and utilized for in vivo injection or it can be enzymatically digested to form a liquid . At this stage the liquid skeletal muscle matrix can be diluted and utilized as a coating for cell culture or can be brought to physiological pH and temperature which triggers assembly into a hydrogel . After raising the pH of the material to 7.4 at room temperature the material can also be re lyophilized for long term storage at 80 C. The material can then be resuspended at a later date using only sterile water and utilized for in vivo injection.

Degradation products of decellularized ECMs have been previously shown to have mitogenic activity. It was examined whether the degradation products of the skeletal muscle matrix hydrogel had a mitogenic effect on cells in vitro. Proliferation of smooth muscle cells and skeletal myoblasts following exposure to either enzymatically degraded skeletal muscle ECM or collagen was assessed. Pepsin was also included as a control as pepsin was utilized to digest the matrix material. A Picogreen assay was used to determine double stranded DNA content at days 3 5 and 7 in culture to quantify cell proliferation. It was found that both smooth muscle cells and myoblasts when cultured in media containing degraded skeletal muscle matrix had a higher rate of proliferation compared to cells cultured in media containing the same concentration of collagen. The increase in cell number was significantly greater at all time points p

A gel form of the matrix was initially made in vitro by bringing the material 6 mg mL to a physiological pH and incubating the material at 37 C. After gelation the material was tested for rheological properties where it was determined that the material had a storage modulus G of 6.5 0.5 Pa. A representative trace of rheological data is shown in . The ability of the liquid skeletal muscle matrix to form a gel in situ were then assessed by injecting the material into a healthy rat hindlimb. For all in vivo studies liquid skeletal muscle matrix which had been biotinylated and re lyophilized for storage at 80 C were utilized. Prior to injection the material was resuspended in sterile water alone. The skeletal muscle matrix was then loaded into a syringe and injected intramuscularly into a rat hindlimb . To determine whether the skeletal muscle matrix would assemble and form a scaffold the injection region was excised after 20 minutes. A visible gel denoted by the white region in was observed within the muscle. Additional matrix injections were cryosectioned and stained to visualize the biotinylated matrix. The liquid skeletal muscle matrix assembled into a fibrous scaffold once in vivo . To assess the microarchitecture of the skeletal muscle matrix hydrogel the material was injected subcutaneously and excised after 20 minutes. Scanning Electron Microscopy SEM demonstrated that the matrix forms a porous fibrous scaffold both in vitro and in vivo that is composed of fibers on the nano and micro scale .

Upon confirmation that the material was able to assemble upon injection the skeletal muscle matrix hydrogel were then examined in a rat hindlimb ischemia model to assess its potential for treating PAD. One week post hindlimb ischemia either skeletal muscle matrix or collagen was injected intramuscularly below the site of femoral artery resection. At 3 5 7 or 14 days post injection the muscle was harvested to determine cellular infiltration. The hydrogel was still present at all time points although it had significantly degraded by day 14. At each time point the amount of neovascularization which would be critical to treat the ischemic tissue as well as the number of muscle cells and muscle progenitors which could aid in repair of the damaged tissue were assessed.

To determine whether the acellular scaffold would support new vessel formation in vivo smooth muscle cells in collagen and skeletal muscle matrix injected regions were labeled via immunohistochemistry. Arteriole density was significantly greater in the skeletal muscle matrix injection region compared to collagen at 3 5 and 7 days post injection with many of the vessels having an average diameter greater than 25 m . While not significant there was still a distinct trend towards an increase in vasculature at day 14 following injection of the skeletal muscle matrix hydrogel. Additionally endothelial cell infiltration was measured in collagen and skeletal muscle matrix injection regions. Endothelial cell density was found to be similar across all four time points but was significantly greater in the skeletal muscle matrix injection region at 3 and 7 days post injection .

In PAD and CLI patients often suffer from general muscle fatigue and atrophy and therefore in addition to increasing vascularization restoring muscle mass would also be beneficial. It was then determined whether muscle cells were also recruited to the injection site using staining against desmin B . The desmin positive cells were also co stained for Ki67 a marker for proliferation as denoted by the arrows in . The skeletal muscle matrix recruited significantly more desmin positive cells when compared to the collagen matrix at 3 5 and 7 days post injection a the trend that continued at day 14 . Moreover the majority of cells expressing desmin also were Ki67 positive indicating proliferating muscle cells were infiltrating the injection region . The number of Ki67 and desmin positive cells was significantly increased at 3 5 and 7 days post injection with the same trend at day 14. Cell infiltration was further assessed using MyoD as a marker for the potential recruitment of activated satellite cells. There was a low number of MyoD positive cells recruited into the injection region of both materials at the examined time points however there was a statistically significant increase in MyoD positive cells in the skeletal muscle matrix . The MyoD staining was prevalently perinuclear which has been shown in other studies.

After milling the skeletal muscle matrix powder is hydrated with sterile water saline or PBS and injected or implanted into the injured limb. Depending on the concentration the injected skeletal muscle matrix can form a bolus or spread throughout the tissue. Upon implantation the skeletal muscle ECM particulate forms a scaffold and creates degradation products that recruit endogenous cells to repair the ischemic region. These cells include blood vessels skeletal muscle cells and skeletal muscle progenitors. By recruiting endogenous cells for repair and regeneration the skeletal muscle matrix particulate has to potential to treat peripheral artery disease and critical limb ischemia and the various complications associated with these diseases.

Skeletal muscle from the hindleg was harvested from Yorkshire pigs approximately 30 45 kg immediately after sedation with a ketamine xylazine combination 25 mg kg 2 mg kg respectively and euthanasia with beuthanasia 1 mL 5 kg . Fat and connective tissue was removed and the skeletal muscle was cut into 1 cmpieces and decellularized. Briefly the tissue was rinsed with deionized water and stirred in 1 wt vol solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS in phosphate buffered saline PBS for 4 5 days. Decellularized skeletal muscle was stirred overnight in deionized water and then agitated rinses under running DI water were performed to remove residual SDS. A sample of decellularized matrix was frozen in Tissue Tek O.C.T. freezing medium sectioned into 10 m slices and stained with hematoxylin and eosin H E to confirm the absence of nuclei. Following the decellularization protocol the ECM was lyophilized overnight and milled to a fine powder using a Wiley Mini Mill. Additionally to quantify DNA content the DNeasy assay Qiagen Valencia Calif. was performed according to manufacturer s instructions. After extraction the Take3 plate was used to measure the concentration of DNA using a Synergy 2 microplate reader Biotek Winooski Vt. .

In order to render the decellularized extracellular matrix ECM into a liquid form the milled form of the matrix was subjected to enzymatic digestion. Pepsin SIGMA St. Louis Mo. was dissolved in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid HCl to make a 1 mg ml pepsin solution and then filtered through a 0.22 m filter Millipore Billerca Mass. . The ECM at a ratio of 10 1 was digested in the pepsin solution under constant stirring. After approximately 48 hours the matrix was brought to a physiological pH in a BSL 2 safety cabinet and then either diluted for in vitro assays or for injection. For in vitro and in vivo studies the skeletal muscle matrix was brought to a pH of 7.4 through the addition of sterile filtered sodium hydroxide NaOH and 10 PBS and further diluted to 6 mg ml using 1 PBS inside a BSL 2 safety cabinet.

Gels of the skeletal muscle matrix were formed at a concentration 6 mg ml for rheological characteristics and for scanning electron microscopy. Either 100 l of matrix was pipetted into a 96 well plate Corning Corning N.Y. or 500 l in glass scintillation vials and incubated overnight to form gels. Rheometry was conducted on the 500 l in vitro formed skeletal muscle matrix gels using a TA instruments AR G2 rheometer. The gels were tested using a 20 mm parallel plate geometry with a 1.2 mm gap at 37 C. Three frequency sweeps were performed within the linear viscoelastic strain region. Samples were run in triplicate and then the values were averaged to calculate the storage modulus.

Scanning electron microscopy SEM was utilized to determine the microstructure of the skeletal muscle matrix gels. These gels were either formed in vivo by injecting the skeletal muscle matrix subcutaneously in a rat and excised after 20 minutes or in vitro after incubation of the material in a 96 well plate at 37 C. overnight. The skeletal muscle matrix gels were harvested and fixed with 2.5 glutaraldehyde for 2 hours and then dehydrated using a series of ethanol rinses 30 100 . Samples were then critical point dried and coated with iridium using an Emitech K575X Sputter coater. Electron microscopy images were taken using a Phillips XL30 Environmental SEM Field Emission microscope at 10 kV with 242 A and a working distance of 10 mm.

Primary rat aortic smooth muscle cells RASMC and C2C12 skeletal myoblasts were maintained on collagen coated plates and split at 1 5 every 2 3 days. Cells between passages 4 and 10 were plated at 750 cells well in 96 well plates in growth media consisting of DMEM 10 fetal bovine serum and 1 pen strep solution. Twenty four hours later the cells were washed with PBS to remove non adherent cells. Digested skeletal muscle matrix and collagen were brought to a pH of 7.4 and then added to the growth media at concentrations of 0.05 mg mL. As the ECM was enzymatically digested pepsin was also included as a control at 0.005 mg mL. All conditions were run in quadruplicate. Every two days media was changed and cell proliferation was assessed using the PICOGREEN assay Invitrogen per manufacturer s directions. Briefly wells were rinsed in PBS and then incubated with 100 L of TE buffer. After incubation for 30 minutes at room temperature followed by 5 minutes on a shaker 100 L of 1 200 Picogreen reagent was added. Upon covering the plates in foil and shaking them for 30 minutes double stranded DNA was quantified using a fluorescent plate reader at 630 nm at days 3 5 and 7.

To prepare for in vivo studies a preliminary test was performed to ensure that the skeletal muscle matrix would be able to gel upon injection. The skeletal muscle matrix was labeled with biotin and then injected into the hindlimbs of healthy Sprague Dawley rats. For biotin labeling a 10 mM solution of EZ link Sulfo NHS Biotin Pierce Rockford Ill. was prepared and mixed with the liquid skeletal muscle matrix for a final concentration of 0.3 mg of biotin mg matrix. The mixture was allowed to sit on ice for two hours. The skeletal muscle matrix was then frozen lyophilized and stored at 80 C. until use. To resuspend the skeletal muscle matrix sterile water was added at the original volume to bring the material to 6 mg ml and vortexed. Female Harlan Sprague Dawley rats 225 250 g were anesthetized using isoflurane at 5 intubated and maintained at 2.5 isoflurane during surgery. In preliminary studies n 2 150 l of skeletal muscle matrix was injected intramuscularly into healthy rats. The muscle was excised after 20 min and fresh frozen using Tissue Tek O.C.T.

After confirmation of gelation in vivo a rat hindlimb ischemia model was utilized to test the skeletal muscle extracellular matrix. Animals were placed in a supine position and hindlimb ischemia was induced by ligation and excision of the femoral artery. After ligation of the proximal end of the femoral artery the distal portion of the saphenous artery was ligated and the artery and side branches were dissected free and then excised. The area was sutured closed and animals were given an analgesic of 0.05 mg kg of buprenorphine hydrochloride Reckitt Benckiser Healthcare UK Ltd. Hull England prior to recovery from anesthesia. One week post injury the rats were anesthetized using 5 isoflurane intubated and maintained at 2.5 isoflurane for injection. Skeletal muscle matrix and rat tail collagen were biotinylated in order to visualize the injection region and 150 l was injected intramuscularly. Injection was confirmed by a lightening of the muscle at the site of injection. Rats were sacrificed using an overdose of sodium pentobarbital 200 mg kg at 3 5 7 or 14 days post injection n 4 except n 3 for 14 day collagen injection and leg muscles were harvested and frozen in Tissue Tek O.C.T.

The excised muscle was cryosectioned into 10 m slices. Slices were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin every 1 mm and screened to determine the location of injected material. Adjacent slides were stained for visualization of biotin labeled skeletal muscle matrix or collagen to confirm the injection site. Slides were fixed in acetone incubated with superblock buffer Pierce followed by 3 hydrogen peroxide Sigma and horseradish peroxidase conjugated neutravidin Pierce at room temperature. The reaction was visualized by incubation with diaminobenzidine DAB Pierce for ten minutes.

Five slides evenly spaced within the injection region were then used for immunohistochemistry IHC . Sections were fixed for 2 min in acetone and blocked with staining buffer for 1 h 2 goat serum and 0.3 Triton X 100 in PBS . Skeletal muscle sections were then assessed for vessel formation using a mouse anti smooth muscle actin antibody Dako Carpinteria Calif. 1 75 dilution to label smooth muscle cells. After three 5 minute washes with PBS AlexaFluor 568 anti mouse Invitrogen 1 200 dilution was used as a secondary. Endothelial cell infiltration was assessed using FITC labeled isolectin Vector Laboratories Burlingame Calif. 1 100 dilution . Slides were then mounted using Fluoromount Sigma . Sections stained with only the primary antibody or secondary antibody were used as negative controls. Images were taken at 100 using Carl Zeiss Observer D.1 and analyzed using AxioVision software. Arterioles were quantified with a visible lumen and a diameter 10 m and normalized over the injection area.

In order to assess proliferating muscle cell infiltration into the injection region sections were stained using a mouse anti desmin antibody Sigma dilution 1 100 and co stained with a rabbit anti Ki67 Santa Cruz Biotech Santa Cruz Calif. dilution 1 100 . AlexaFluor 488 anti mouse and AlexaFluor 568 anti rabbit were used for secondary antibodies 1 200 followed by staining with Hoechst 33342. Slides were mounted with Fluoromount Sigma prior to imaging. Additionally the skeletal muscle tissue was assessed using a rabbit anti MyoD Santa Cruz Biotech Santa Cruz Calif. dilution 1 100 followed by AlexaFluor 488 anti rabbit as a secondary antibody and Hoechst 33342. Three 400 images were taken per slide and analyzed using AxioVision software. The number of desmin positive cells and desmin positive cells that co localized with Ki67 were counted averaged and normalized over the area. For the tissue sections analyzed for MyoD the number of positive cells with MyoD co localized with nuclei were counted and averaged over the area of injection.

All data is presented as the mean standard error of mean. For the in vitro assays samples were run in quadruplicate and results were averaged. Significance was determined using a one way analysis of variance ANOVA with a Bonferroni post test. A two tailed Student s t test was used for all other data and reported as p

In conclusion the present invention provides an injectable skeletal muscle extracellular matrix scaffold as a new biomaterial only therapy for treating PAD and CLI and complications associated with these diseases. The invention demonstrates that decellularized skeletal muscle ECM can be processed to form an injectable matrix material which assembles into a porous and fibrous scaffold in vivo. The invention also demonstrates that degradation products of the material induce proliferation of smooth muscle cells and skeletal myoblasts in vitro. Furthermore the invention provides that the injected scaffold increased neovascularization and infiltration of muscle cells within the biomaterial as compared to collagen suggesting that it improves neovascularization in PAD as well as treat the associated muscle atrophy. Thus the invention provides a novel therapeutic treatment method for PAD and CLI with an injectable scaffold derived from decellularized skeletal muscle ECM.
