This application is a continuation of and claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. 120 to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 253 801 filed on Oct. 5 2011 which claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 542 545 filed Oct. 3 2011 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties and made a part hereof.

The management of a patent portfolio involves multiple stages. Initially a decision must be made as to what inventions are worth the investment of filing a patent application. Then each filed patent application goes through prosecution with the patent office. Finally for each patent that is allowed maintenance fees must be paid at a variety of intervals to keep the patent in force.

The management of a patent portfolio involves multiple stages. Initially a decision must be made as to what inventions are worth the investment of filing a patent application. Then each filed patent application goes through prosecution with the patent office. Finally for each patent that is allowed maintenance fees must be paid at a variety of intervals to keep the patent in force. At each stage there are opportunities to stop spending the time and resources to obtain and maintain a patent.

In order to make knowledgeable choices the manager of the portfolio may want to know a variety of information. For example before paying maintenance fees of an issued patent a manager may want to know the estimated cost of the annuities over the life of the patent whether the patent covers any current products of a company whether the patent covers competitors patents whether the patent is related to a licensing agreement how influential a patent is and what companies have been patenting recently. In a further example before an invention disclosure or patent application is even approved for filing a patent portfolio manager may want to assess the impact of the prior art known at that time. New prior art may also come to light later on which may affect a manager s decision to authorize subsequent annuity payments. In the fast moving world of today there are increasing pressures to make decisions quickly. In various embodiments a patent portfolio and annuity management system hereinafter also referred to as annuity management system or management system provides tools to quickly provide information and facilitate the manager s decisions with respect to patent portfolio management.

Network may include local area networks LAN wide area networks WAN wireless networks e.g. 802.11 or cellular network the Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN network ad hoc networks personal area networks e.g. Bluetooth or other combinations or permutations of network protocols and network types. The network may include a single local area network LAN or wide area network WAN or combinations of LAN s or WAN s such as the Internet. The various devices coupled to network may be coupled to network via one or more wired or wireless connections.

Web server may communicate with file server to publish or serve files stored on file server . Web server may also communicate or interface with the application server to enable web based presentation of information. For example application server may consist of scripts applications or library files that provide primary or auxiliary functionality to web server e.g. multimedia file transfer or dynamic interface functions . In addition application server may also provide some or the entire interface for web server to communicate with one or more of the other servers in the patent portfolio and annuity management system e.g. database management server . Web server either alone or in conjunction with one or more other computers in management system may provide a user interface. The user interface may be implemented using a variety of programming languages or programming methods such as HTML HyperText Markup Language VBScript Visual Basic Scripting Edition JavaScript XML Extensible Markup Language XSLT Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations AJAX Asynchronous JavaScript and XML Java JFC Java Foundation Classes and Swing an Application Programming Interface for Java .

User terminal may be a personal computer or mobile device. In an embodiment user terminal includes a client program to interface with the management system . The client program may include commercial software custom software open source software freeware shareware or other types of software packages. In an embodiment the client program includes a thin client designed to provide query and data manipulation tools for a user of user terminal . The client program may interact with a server program hosted by for example application server . Additionally the client program may interface with database management server .

Operations database may be composed of one or more logical or physical databases. For example operations database may be viewed as a system of databases that when viewed as a compilation represent an operations database. Sub databases in such a configuration may include a matter database portfolio database user database patent reference document or prior art database product database watch database and mapping database. Operations database may be implemented as a relational database a centralized database a distributed database an object oriented database or a flat database in various embodiments.

Data stored in a first database may be associated with data in a second database through the use of common data fields. For example consider entries in the patent database formatted as Patent ID Patent Number and entries in the product database formatted as Product ID Product Name Patent ID . In this manner a product entry in the product database is associated with a patent in the patent database through the Patent ID data field. In various embodiments a product may be associated with more than one patent by creating multiple entries in the product database one for each patent the product is associated with. In other embodiments one or more patent reference documents may be associated with a patent by creating multiple entries in the patent database for example. The formats and data field titles are for illustration purposes and other names and formats may be used. Additionally further associations between data stored in the databases may be created as discussed further herein.

During operation of patent portfolio and annuity management system data from multiple data sources internal and external is imported into or accessed by the operations database . Internal sources may include data from portfolio management and annuity payment services affiliated with management system . External sources may include websites or databases associated with foreign and domestic patent offices assignment databases WIPO and INPADOC. In various embodiments the data is scraped and parsed from the websites if it is unavailable through a database. The data may be gathered using API calls to the sources when available. The data may be imported and stored in the operations database on a scheduled basis such as weekly monthly quarterly or some other regular or periodic interval. Alternatively the data may be imported on demand.

After data importation the data may be standardized into a common format. For example database records from internal or external sources may not be in a compatible format with the operations database. Data conditioning may include data rearrangement normalization filtering e.g. removing duplicates sorting binning or other operations to transform the data into a common format e.g. using similar date formats and name formats .

The user interface elements may include my matters patent watches company watches and prior art . These elements may be used to select a context view of the portfolio and annuity management system. For example my matters lists the patents included within a portfolio of a user patent watches lists information on patents that the user has indicated the management system is to watch and company watches lists information on companies that the user has indicated the system should watch. Prior art allows a user to perform analysis on prior art. Further details of each of these are included herein.

Date boxes and are user elements that allow a user to select a time period. Amount due box displays the amount due with respect to annuities for patents in the portfolio of the user within the period indicated by date boxes and . Upon activating e.g. clicking one of the date boxes a user may be presented with a calendar which allows the selection of a date. Upon selecting a date the date boxes will update to reflect the user s choice.

Drop down menu includes a list of portfolios that a user of the management system is authorized to view. For example before user interface is displayed a login screen may be presented to the user which requests a user ID and password. In various embodiments the user ID is associated with one or more portfolios. In turn each portfolio is associated with one or more matters. Matters may include US and foreign issued patents pending patents abandoned patents and not yet filed applications. Thus upon selection of a portfolio using drop down menu user interface is populated with matters associated with the portfolio.

Checkbox is an option to only display matters that currently have an annuity due. Drop down menu allows further filtering of matters. For example the matters may be filtered by US patents only US patent applications and foreign only.

In various embodiments activation of button updates user interface to reflect the choices made by the user with respect to date boxes and checkbox and drop down menu . For example amount due box will be updated to reflect the amount due within the new period and the matters listed under column headings may be filtered. In various embodiments user interface is updated as the user selections are made with respect to elements to without activating button .

In an example embodiment user database stores data representing users of patent portfolio and annuity management system . The data may include data fields of user credentials including a user ID and password and access rights with respect to the management system . The user ID may be the same as the user ID of other systems associated with management system . For example the user ID may be used in a portfolio management system. In this manner access rights of the user with respect to the portfolio management system may follow to the management system . In various embodiments each user ID is associated with one or more portfolio IDs. Thus when a user logs into the management system the user is presented with access to only the portfolios that have been associated with the user ID. More or fewer data fields associated with a user may be included in a user entry stored in user database .

Portfolio database in an example embodiment stores data representing portfolios of one or more matters. A matter may include foreign or domestic issued patents in addition to applications. Data stored in portfolio database may initially have been generated in a portfolio management system and imported into patent portfolio and annuity management system through the use of one or more API calls or direct access to the data in the portfolio management system. In various embodiments a portfolio may be generated by user using the management system . For example user interface may be presented to the user requesting a name in portfolio and identifiers of matters to be included in the portfolio. In an embodiment a portfolio entry in portfolio database includes data fields of portfolio ID and portfolio name. Additionally a data field for matter ID may also be included in an entry in the portfolio database. Thus each portfolio may be associated with one or more matters through the use of the matter ID data field. More or fewer data fields associated with a portfolio may be included in a portfolio entry of portfolio database .

In an embodiment matter database stores data representing matters. Each matter may be associated with one or more portfolios as well as one or more watches. In some embodiments a matter is associated with no portfolios or watches. In an embodiment a matter entry includes data fields representing a matter ID title e.g. the name of the patent or application type of the matter e.g. application issued patent PCT application status of the matter e.g. issued abandoned allowed a link to the patent office where the matter was filed a link to a PDF download of the matter abstract of the matter inventors of the matter current owner of the matter cited references on the face of the matter filed date issue date docket number and annuity information e.g. due date country and amount due . In some embodiments other patent reference documents or prior art in any form may be stored and associated with one or more matters. More or fewer data fields associated with a patent may be included in a matter entry stored in matter database . In an example embodiment matter database may store a patent matter database wherein this database includes data about the patent matters. The data may include for at least one patent matter a claim set or statement of invention and a priority date for the claim set or statement of invention. Matter database may also store a database of prior art documents also known as references wherein the prior art database includes data about the prior art documents. The data may include for at least one prior art document a priority date or publication date of the document. One or more of the prior art documents may be associated with a first patent matter in the patent matter database.

In various embodiments a matter is associated with one or more other matters as a family with a family ID. Family members may be priority documents continuation patents applications divisional patents applications and foreign patent application counterparts. In an embodiment family information is determined according to an external source such as INPADOC. Patent reference documents and or other prior art may be manually or automatically stored cross cited and associated with related family matters for example.

In an embodiment watch database stores data representing user preferences with respect to objects the user wants to track e.g. watch . In an embodiment an object is a company or a matter. With respect to matters a user may indicate a preference to track the matter for any forward citations within a time period e.g. 60 days 3 months etc . Thus watch database may store entries with a Watch ID that is associated with a User ID and a matter ID. With respect to companies a user may indicate a preference to watch for publications or issued patents with a timer period. Thus watch database may store entries with a Watch ID a user ID and a company name. In various embodiments the watches are user ID specific such that no matter what profile the user is viewing the watches do not change.

In an embodiment product database stores data representing products. The products may be actual products manufactured by the user products yet to be released planned products products covered in a licensing agreement or a fictional product. In various embodiments product database stores entries with a product ID and product name which are associated with a user ID. In various embodiments a user may tag a product as associated with a matter. Thus an entry in the product database may also be associated with a matter ID.

In various embodiments analytics database stores data representing information on matters and companies associated with patent portfolio and annuity management system . This information may be organized according to an individual matter a portfolio a family or company. The information may be gathered from internal or external sources of patent portfolio and annuity management system or may be generated by examining the data stored in one or more databases of the management system .

In various embodiments information for an individual matter may include status e.g. disclosure received drafting filed completed waiting examination in prosecution allowed issued cited prior art list and type of rejections e.g. 35 U.S.C. 101 102 103 number of claims allowed office action count interviews held IDS statements filed attorney fees to date and PTO fees to date. Further metrics for an individual matter stored in analytics database may include time waiting for examiner total time in examination time waiting for PTO while in examination and time on appeal. Additional prosecution details formatter may include an upcoming docket dates e.g. due dates for office action IDS due dates etc. . A claim prosecution history chart may also be stored in analytics database for each matter. The prosecution history may include a history of claim amendments and arguments made in prosecution.

In various embodiments analytics for an individual matter may also include data representing a claim chart. The claim chart may include one or more scope concepts on one axis and claims on the other axis. In an embodiment a scope concept is a textual description of what a patent claim is at least limited to. Thus if a claim comprises A B C a scope concept may be A. In various embodiments a scope concept for the claim may be broader than A because the claim will still be limited to the broader scope concept. In an embodiment the claim charts store mappings between claims and scope concepts. The claim chart may include a variety of levels of granularity of scope concepts. Some claims may be mapped to all of the scope concepts while others may not be mapped to any scope concepts. In various embodiments the mappings may have already been generated in a program external to the management system e.g. a portfolio mapping system . In various embodiments claim charts may be combined at the portfolio level. Thus a portfolio level chart may include scope concepts for all the claims or in some examples only the independent claims in the portfolio.

In various embodiments portfolio and family analytics information may be stored in analytics database based on aggregating the metrics for an individual matter. In an embodiment the analytics of a family may differ from those in a portfolio as not all family member matters may be part of a portfolio. Additionally the analytics may be stored for multiple time periods such that comparisons may be made between metrics currently and metrics a year ago or other time period .

Aggregated metrics may include a total patents and applications pending and waiting for examination in prosecution with no claims allowed in prosecution with some claims allowed appealed notice of allowance received and issued. These metrics may be compiled for both US and international matters in the portfolio. Additional information may include the international portfolio distribution by country. An age distribution of the portfolio may also be compiled. For example the portfolio may be broken down by less than one year old 1 to 3 years old 3 to 5 years old 5 to 10 years old 10 to 20 years old and 20 or more years old. Recent filing and issue activity as well as upcoming Ford filing deadlines may be stored in analytics database .

In various embodiments prosecution metrics across a portfolio or family are determined and stored in analytics database . This data may include matters waiting for examination matters in examination matters appealed and cases allowed but not yet issued. Analytics with respect office actions may also be compiled and stored. For example success of allowance after a first office action response a second response etc. may be stored in analytics database . Additional prosecution analytics may include allowance rate e.g. 10 after a telephone interview allowance after an in person interview percentage of interviews with response number and type of rejection average time in prosecution e.g. in months average time to file a response and average time to next office action. Further the list of recently allowed cases recently appeal cases stalled cases and recently abandoned cases may also be stored for each portfolio and family in analytics database .

In various embodiments data stored in the database for group of matters in a portfolio or family is analyzed to determine the top e.g. ten most cited patents the top most cited inventors top most cited prior art owners e.g. according to assignment documents or the face of the patent newly e.g. within the last 60 days cited prior art owners and top most cited prior art inventors. This information may be stored in analytics database .

In various embodiments annuity cost information regarding cost projections for both US issued patents and international patents may also be stored. Upcoming foreign filing deadlines with respect to annuities may also be stored in analytics database .

In various embodiments the results of keyword analysis on one or more matters and or prior art references may be stored in analytics database . The keyword analysis may be based on the occurrences of the keywords in the matter or references to derive a score or keyword overlap.

In various embodiments input module receives data from multiple sources where it may be further processed by one or more other modules and stored in one or more of databases . For example input module may be configured to utilize one or more APIs to data from one or more patent data stores e.g. public PAIR private PAIR INPADOC foreign patent offices patent docketing systems portfolio management systems etc . The data may include published patent documents patent applications office actions or other patent office correspondence prior art references claim mappings dockets dates and annuity payment data.

In various embodiments input module is configured to receive input from one or more user interface elements. For example the management system may present multiple user interfaces to users. These user interfaces may enable users to input data directly into databases instruct the management system to retrieve data from patent data stores and instruct the management system to perform various operations on the data in databases .

Additionally input module may be configured to determine the selection of one or more user interface elements by a user and initiate the action associated with the selected user interface element. For example user interface element may include a drop down menu to select a portfolio. Input module may be configured to receive a selection of the portfolio and a drop down menu. Then input module may pass the selection to one or more other modules for further processing. For example display module may update the drop down menu to indicate the selection of a portfolio.

In various embodiments parsing module takes the data that has initially been inputted by input module and formats it according to the data fields of databases as discussed above. For example consider a patent publication that is been inputted by input module . Parsing module may use a combination of automatic image recognition and text analysis to determine the filing date issue date title abstract and claims of the patent. In some embodiments parsing module may flag certain pieces of data that had been determined to be potentially inaccurate e.g. a number could not be read . A user of management system may then examine the flagged data and manually enter in the information.

The resulting data that has been parsed by parsing module may then be entered as an entry in one or more of databases . This may be accomplished by for example formulating an SQL query with the parsed information. In various embodiments parsing module may parse multiple piece of information before generating a database entry. For example input module may receive a docket number for an issued patent. The docket number may be combined with the information parse from the issued patent to form an entry in matter database .

In various embodiments analytics module is configured to examine and run calculations on the data stored in the databases to generate the analytics discussed previously. For example analytics module may formulate an SQL query that retrieves the number of times that a prior art reference has been cited within a portfolio. This query may be run for each prior art cited within the portfolio to determine a list of the most cited e.g. the top ten prior art references with a portfolio. In an embodiment the queries are formulated and run as requested by a user. In an embodiment once the analytics information has been determined it is stored within analytics database . In various embodiments queries are formulated and run on a period basis e.g. nightly and entries in analytics database may be updated to reflect any changes.

In various embodiments the analytics module is configured to receive input identifying a pool of keywords for a first patent matter in matter database and associated prior art documents in matter database . The term keyword is intended to include individual keywords as well as a number of keywords grouped together making up a key phrase for example. The module may be further configured to perform a keyword analysis on the first patent matter and associated prior art documents based on occurrences of the keywords in the first patent matter and associated prior art documents. The module may be further configured to identify based on the analysis keywords occurring uniquely in the first patent matter. In view of their uniquely occurring nature these keywords may be regarded as claim elements potentially differentiating the claim set or statement of invention over the disclosures contained in the one or more prior art documents.

The analytics module may be further configured to perform the keyword analysis automatically on the first patent matter and the one or more prior art documents simultaneously. Prior art button shown in may be selected by a portfolio manager to enter further user displays and start the automatic keyword analysis. The analytics module may be further configured to receive synonyms of the keywords to add to the pool of identified keywords. In this way the keyword analysis may be enhanced.

The analytics module may be further configured to automatically rank the prior art documents based on the degree of differentiation between the first patent matter and the one or more prior art documents based on the keyword analysis. The analytics module may be further configured to rank the prior art document with the highest degree of differentiation as lowest ranked in potential relevance to the claim set or statement of invention of the first patent matter. Similarly the analytics module may be further configured to rank the prior art document with the lowest degree of differentiation as highest ranked in potential relevance to the claim set or statement of invention of the first patent matter.

The analytics module may be further configured to derive a keyword differentiation score based on the keyword analysis for the one or more prior art documents. The analytics module may be further configured to derive a keyword overlap score based on the keyword analysis for the one or more prior art documents.

The analytics module may be further configured to identify the cited inventors or assignees of the prior art documents and automatically rank the prior art documents by inventor or assignee having the most keywords occurring in one or more of the prior art documents.

In an embodiment display module is configured to display user interfaces and information retrieved from one or more databases . For example display module may generate user interface of . If a user is accessing management system remotely e.g. through a web browser display module may be configured to transmit data representing a user interface through a network to a user terminal.

The display module may be further configured to provide in the user interface a visual indication of the ranking in a time line.

The display module may be further configured to visually provide in the user interface a time line representing the priority date of the first patent matter and the priority or publication dates of the or each prior art document. The display module may be further configured to provide a visual indication of the degree of differentiation of the one or more prior documents in the time line.

The display module may be further configured to provide in the user interface a visual indication of the technology class and or subclass of the first patent matter and the one or more prior art documents. In an example embodiment the display module may be further configured to provide in the user interface a time line or chart indicating when one or more of the identified keywords first appeared in one or more of the prior art documents.

In various embodiments filtering module is configured to filter a set of matters according to a user preference. For example a user may activate a check box that indicates only pending matters should be shown in a user interface. Filtering module may formulate a query consistent with retrieving only pending matters. The results of the query may then be shared with display module where the user interface may be updated.

In various embodiments mapping module is configured to receive or generate mappings from a product to a matter. This may be accomplished for example by receiving a selection of a product by user and a matter by the user. In various embodiments mapping module is configured to present an automated mapping of the product to a matter for user to confirm or deny. For example mapping module may present a claim chart for an issued patent to a user. As discussed the claim chart includes one or more scope concepts that one or more the claims of the patent are limited to. In conjunction with input module mapping module may receive selections of the user of one or more of the scope concepts that are potentially affiliated with the product. Thus a comparison may be made between what the claims are limited to and what the product may be. For example if a product as defined by the selection of one or more scope concepts by the user is affiliated toward scope concepts A B and C and claim of the patent has been mapped to scope concepts A B and C the mapping module may present an option to map the product to the patent. In various embodiments the user may override this recommendation and select to not map the product to the patent. Similarly a user may indicate that a product is affiliated with the patent even if the scope concepts do not match.

In various embodiments the mapping module is configured to receive or generate mappings from prior art to a matter. This may be accomplished for example by receiving a selection of prior art and a matter by the user. The selection of the prior art may be based on cited references or though other external prior art search. The selections may be conducted manually by a user or automatically by analytics module for example. In various embodiments mapping module is configured to present an automated mapping of the prior art to a matter for user to review. In various embodiments the mapping module can be configured to carry out any of the keyword analysis described above in relation to analytics module .

In an embodiment once the product or prior art mapping information has been determined it is stored within analytics database or matter database . In various embodiments queries are formulated and run on a period basis e.g. nightly and entries in analytics database or matter database may be updated to reflect any changes.

In various embodiments payment module is configured to receive selections by the user of which annuities to pay for matters in a portfolio.

Certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of components modules or mechanisms. Modules may constitute either software modules e.g. code embodied 1 on a non transitory machine readable medium or 2 in a transmission signal or hardware implemented modules. A hardware implemented module is tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments one or more computer systems e.g. a standalone client or server computer system or one or more processors may be configured by software e.g. an application or application portion as a hardware implemented module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.

In various embodiments a hardware implemented module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example a hardware implemented module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured e.g. as a special purpose processor such as a field programmable gate array FPGA or an application specific integrated circuit ASIC to perform certain operations. A hardware implemented module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry e.g. as encompassed within a general purpose processor or other programmable processor that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware implemented module mechanically in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry or in temporarily configured circuitry e.g. configured by software may be driven by cost and time considerations.

Accordingly the term hardware implemented module should be understood to encompass a tangible entity be that an entity that is physically constructed permanently configured e.g. hardwired or temporarily or transitorily configured e.g. programmed to operate in a certain manner and or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which hardware implemented modules are temporarily configured e.g. programmed each of the hardware implemented modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example where the hardware implemented modules comprise a general purpose processor configured using software the general purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware implemented modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor for example to constitute a particular hardware implemented module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware implemented module at a different instance of time.

Hardware implemented modules can provide information to and receive information from other hardware implemented modules. Accordingly the described hardware implemented modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware implemented modules exist contemporaneously communications may be achieved through signal transmission e.g. over appropriate circuits and buses that connect the hardware implemented modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware implemented modules are configured or instantiated at different times communications between such hardware implemented modules may be achieved for example through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware implemented modules have access. For example one hardware implemented module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware implemented module may then at a later time access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware implemented modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices and can operate on a resource e.g. a collection of information .

The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed at least partially by one or more processors that are temporarily configured e.g. by software or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured such processors may constitute processor implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may in some example embodiments comprise processor implemented modules.

Similarly the methods described herein may be at least partially processor implemented. For example at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or processors or processor implemented modules. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors not only residing within a single machine but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments the processor or processors may be located in a single location e.g. within a home environment an office environment or as a server farm while in other embodiments the processors may be distributed across a number of locations.

The one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a cloud computing environment or as a software as a service SaaS . For example at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers as examples of machines including processors these operations being accessible via a network e.g. the Internet and via one or more appropriate interfaces e.g. Application Program Interfaces APIs . 

Example embodiments may be implemented in digital electronic circuitry or in computer hardware firmware software or in combinations of them. Example embodiments may be implemented using a computer program product e.g. a computer program tangibly embodied in an information carrier e.g. in a machine readable medium for execution by or to control the operation of data processing apparatus e.g. a programmable processor a computer or multiple computers.

A computer program can be written in any form of programming language including compiled or interpreted languages and it can be deployed in any form including as a stand alone program or as a module subroutine or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.

In example embodiments operations may be performed by one or more programmable processors executing a computer program to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. Method operations can also be performed by and apparatus of example embodiments may be implemented as special purpose logic circuitry e.g. a field programmable gate array FPGA or an application specific integrated circuit ASIC .

The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client server relationship to each other. In embodiments deploying a programmable computing system it will be appreciated that that both hardware and software architectures require consideration. Specifically it will be appreciated that the choice of whether to implement certain functionality in permanently configured hardware e.g. an ASIC in temporarily configured hardware e.g. a combination of software and a programmable processor or a combination of permanently and temporarily configured hardware may be a design choice. Below are set out hardware e.g. machine and software architectures that may be deployed in various example embodiments.

In some example embodiments a machine is shown in the example form of a computer system within which instructions for causing the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein may be executed. In alternative embodiments the machine operates as a standalone device or may be connected e.g. networked to other machines. In a networked deployment the machine may operate in the capacity of a server or a client machine in server client network environment or as a peer machine in a peer to peer or distributed network environment. The machine may be a personal computer PC a tablet PC a set top box STB a Personal Digital Assistant PDA a cellular telephone a web appliance a network router switch or bridge or any machine capable of executing instructions sequential or otherwise that specify actions to be taken by that machine. Further while only a single machine is illustrated the term machine shall also be taken to include any collection of machines that individually or jointly execute a set or multiple sets of instructions to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein.

The example computer system may include a processor e.g. a central processing unit CPU a graphics processing unit GPU or both a main memory and a static memory which communicate with each other via a bus. The computer system may further include a video display unit e.g. a liquid crystal display LCD or a cathode ray tube CRT . The computer system may also include an alphanumeric input device e.g. a keyboard a user interface UI navigation device e.g. a mouse a disk drive unit a signal generation device e.g. a speaker and a network interface device.

The term machine readable medium may include a single medium or multiple media e.g. a centralized or distributed database and or associated caches and servers that store the one or more instructions or data structures. The term machine readable medium shall also be taken to include any tangible medium that is capable of storing encoding or carrying instructions for execution by the machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present invention or that is capable of storing encoding or carrying data structures utilized by or associated with such instructions. The term machine readable medium shall accordingly be taken to include but not be limited to solid state memories and optical and magnetic media. Specific examples of machine readable media include non volatile memory including by way of example semiconductor memory devices e.g. Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory EPROM Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory EEPROM and flash memory devices magnetic disks such as internal hard disks and removable disks magneto optical disks and CD ROM and DVD ROM disks.
