The present application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61 892 632 filed on Oct. 18 2013 the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

The cost of health care has risen to unsustainable levels. In the United States approximately 5 of the population utilizes 49 of all health care resources and many of these patients have multiple comorbidities and suffer from chronic conditions. It has been estimated by the Institute of Medicine that 690 billion or roughly one third of the United States health care budget represents wasted spending. From a financial perspective the United States health care system is evolving from a fee for service system to a quality system based primarily on patient outcomes. One of the keys to this evolving global payment system is preventing unnecessary spending including avoiding costly hospital admissions and readmissions.

A formidable underlying issue affecting health care delivery is early symptom recognition associated with suboptimal communication between patients and their health care providers. Inordinate delays in reporting symptomatic changes can interfere with efficient diagnosis proper evaluation and effective treatment. Symptom exacerbations not detected in the early stages and resultant reporting delays to physicians or care coordination teams can result in higher levels of disease severity and costly hospital admissions and readmissions.

Population health management strategies focus on caring for individuals within a community based continuous care no charge system. Care extends seamlessly from in patient hospitalization through rehabilitation long term care and into home environments. Patient monitoring is important throughout these phases of care yet can be especially challenging cumbersome and expensive while also not being sufficiently effective. For example fall alert monitoring systems can provide valuable information about a patient s condition. However these systems are designed for after the fact episodes such as after the patient has already fallen and potentially sustained injuries and are therefore ineffective at predicting a patient fall in advance.

In response to the issues described above the inventor has recognized a need to provide a health care early warning system among other enhanced tools strategies and techniques that can help health care providers and other practitioners to monitor patient condition and to maximize patient care.

In various embodiments the invention offers tools strategies and techniques for remote early detection of disease onset or exacerbation based on deviations from established patterns of patient movement or other activity. The invention may use a variety of analytical tools such as neural networking or machine learning algorithms to generate a movement pattern or activity signature for a patient. Once established a patient activity signature can be compared to observed patient behavior to detect unacceptable or unexpected deviations from the activity signature. Deviation from a patient movement signature can be detected and can cause an alert or other notification to be generated or communicated to a physician for example or other appropriate health care providers.

The inventor has discovered many different scenarios in which it is useful to apply a predictive analysis with a patient activity signature such as to facilitate intervention on the patient s behalf to provide health care. For example a patient with poorly controlled diabetes will walk less due to hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic changes that result in gait instability and or dizziness. Patients with conditions such as worsening CHF or COPD will awaken more frequently at night. In another example a patient with an exacerbation or nuance of pneumonia will tend to stay in bed longer. A person with CVD who is experiencing exertional dyspnea might take shorter walks. A person on dialysis with fluid overload or electrolyte imbalance will likely take more frequent naps. In another example a person experiencing medication side effects such as fatigue will tend to go to bed earlier in the evening. Also in still another example a patient who suffers a hip fracture secondary to a fall often experiences gait instability with changes in ambulation prior to the fall. In each of these scenarios a proper predictive analysis can be useful to provide an advance warning to health care providers of changing or deteriorating patient conditions.

With reference to a patient engages in movement or other activity associated with different locations or positions . An activity detection device may be operatively associated with the patient and may be programmed to collect various data representative of the movement or activity of the patient . The device may be embodied as a low energy drain rechargeable wearable data collection device for example. The device can be worn on the neck arm wrist or other convenient location on the body of the patient . In various embodiments the device may include a plurality of sensors such as motion sensors tilt sensors inertia sensors global positioning systems GPS accelerometers and or many others. In certain embodiments other types of sensors e.g. non motion sensors may be used to augment the accuracy of the motion signature deviation data. Such other types of sensors may include heart rate sensors blood pressure sensors breathing or oxygen sensors or other kinds of sensors which detect and transmit signals representative of the physiological condition of the patient for example.

In certain embodiments the device may be a smart phone mobile phone electronic tablet or another type of wireless enabled device. The device may include a wireless transmitter for example for collecting and sending data to a relay station for performing Internet data uploads to a data analysis system . The relay station may be located in an environment around the patient and may be programmed to receive data from the device with subsequent transfer via the Internet of secure encrypted data to analytic software algorithms and other processes of the system . In certain embodiments the device may communicate collect data and or transmit data with or without assistance from the relay station .

In the example shown the system may include a web server programmed to receive communicated patient data and or to host one or more web sites. One or more websites configured generated and or displayed by the web server may be based on a LAMP stack i.e. a combination of components derived from Linux Apache MySQL and PHP for example. The system may also include an application server programmed to process transactions associated with receiving accessing or storing patient activity or patient movement data. In various embodiments the system may include various modules A E programmed for executing computer based instructions for directing a processor or computer system to perform different tasks or functions within the system . A data analytics module A may be programmed for receiving and processing data associated with patient activity or movement related data including generating various patient activity signatures for example. The data analytics module A may work in connection with a machine learning module B to assist with the process of determining patterns associated with patient behavior that can be converted into predictive models such as patient activity signatures. A patient activity monitoring module C may be programmed for comparing generated patient activity signatures against actual patient activity movement or motion data to determine whether a deviation from the patient activity signature has occurred for example. An alert notification module D may be programmed to generate notifications such as when actual patient movement data is outside standard tolerances for a given patient activity signature for example. Also other modules E may be provided in the system to perform other types of tasks functions and or data analyses. In various embodiments one or more databases or other types of data storage media may be provided in the system for storing and retrieving patient activity data and or patient activity signature data for example.

With reference to communicated raw data can be received deciphered and processed by the data analysis system at step using a plurality of statistical methods and algorithms. Motion can be quantified and analyzed in terms of magnitude duration frequency and temporal occurrence among other factors. Motion can be detected and converted to the degree of movement in specified intervals e.g. hourly daily weekly weekdays weekends or specific intervals such as sleep or wake periods. Data may be collected and analyzed in response to temporal occurrence including determining specifically when the motion occurs e.g. time of morning upon awakening or sleeping sleep interruption etc. The data analytics module A and the machine learning module B can be programmed to refine patterns progressively over time at step with the development of an epoch based personalized activity signature or patient activity signature for each patient . An example of a graphical representation of a patient activity signature is shown in .

In various embodiments motion can be plotted e.g. mathematically superimposed via machine learning for example over time to create an evolving progressively refined spectrum of activity e.g. by magnitude frequency and or duration . As the spectrum becomes refined the data can be analyzed and deviations can be statistically determined by the patient activity monitoring module C at step for example to refine the patient activity signature and or to signal a change in patient condition at step . As illustrated in the example of tolerance bands can be established around one or more aspects of a patient activity signature to determine deviations from the patient activity signature . In the tolerance bands have been established with respect to deviations from an acceptable degree of movement by a patient e.g. as measured quantitatively along the y axis direction . For example can be used as a tool to understand whether the patient has moved an inordinate distance in the relevant time period. In another example illustrates how tolerance bands can be established with respect to deviations from an acceptable degree of the temporal aspects of movement e.g. as quantified along the x axis in terms of hours days day parts or another time measurement . can be used as a tool to understand whether the patient has initiated movement at a time that is earlier than expected or later than expected such as movement occurring at 12 00 am instead of at 6 00 am when the patient normally rises from sleep for example.

Deviations from individualized patterns can be detected and utilized to refine the evolving signature and or to report significant departures from the progressively refined signature. The degree to which data matches or deviates from a progressively refined patient activity signature can be represented by green amber or red dashboard notifications for example through operation of the alert notification module D. For example a green indicator may mean patient activity is within one standard deviation of an expected activity level an amber indicator may mean patient activity is within two standard deviations of an expected activity level and a red indicator may mean patient activity exceeds two standard deviations from expected activity level. Z scores and other statistical methods can be utilized by the data analytics module A and or the activity monitoring module C for example to determine significant deviations from progressively established patterns. At step intervention action may be taken by a physician or other health care providers in response to deviation in actual or observed patient movement or other activity from the patient activity signature.

In various embodiments the sensitivity for alert generation and reporting purposes can be tunable and adjustable through tools provided within the system such as the alert notification module D. For example warnings or other alerts associated with patient activity or movement can be presented to a user with dashboard screens. Dashboards can be reviewed and monitored on a periodic basis for example and may present key indicators for each subject or patient such as a deviation in overall activity deviation in timing of activity and or deviation in other life activity patterns e.g. sleep interruptions . In the dashboard example shown in a first column includes a patient list and other columns may be colored respectively green for low risk amber for medium risk or red for high risk corresponding to a current alert level for each patient. In certain embodiments accessing alert data in the dashboard may launch a secondary screen that explains the nature of or reason for the alert display patient contact information or demographic data and or display special notes e.g. see column . A clinician can respond to the alert by selecting check boxes on the dashboard screen for example corresponding to an appropriate action or intervention e.g. call patient call physician etc. The clinician can also be allowed to type documentation notes into the dashboard screen. Once the clinician completes the screen an indicator such as column can be configured to display what action has been scheduled or ordered. In certain embodiments the clinician may also have the option to select a false positive status that enables the system to perform a progressive adjustment to the personalized patient activity signature.

In various embodiments one or more different types of users may access or communicate with the system through a variety of access devices. Examples of such access devices may include without limitation desktop computers laptops notebooks mobile devices e.g. phones smart phones tablets etc. or many other types of computing devices or computer systems. Communications which occur between or among the system patients and or various other users may be conducted through one or more kinds of communication media such as networked media A wireless media B and or wireline connections C.

In various embodiments of the invention it can be seen that a combination of a wearable multi sensor motion detection device and data analytics may be utilized to provide early detection or warning of new symptoms or disease exacerbation through analysis of deviations in progressively refined patterns of motion embodied as a personalized activity signature.

In one example of the application of certain embodiments of the invention a 39 year old diabetic woman typically walks approximately one to two miles each afternoon between 1 00 p.m. and 3 00 p.m. as part of her routine exercise regimen. During the day she normally walks another half mile total. This morning she is not feeling well. After awakening at 10 00 a.m. typically 8 30 a.m. she fails to walk during the afternoon and only travels back and forth to the bathroom four times that day. Various aspects of the present system can be programmed to detect a multi variable deviation from her motion signature profile or patient activity signature in terms of time of awakening total distance traveled and failure to walk during the afternoon. This triggers a warning on a networked based disease exacerbation dashboard and as a result the care coordination team calls to check on her that afternoon. She is prompted to take a glucometer reading and her blood glucose level is noted to be 495. Instructions are provided to the patient and a home health assessment is arranged.

In another example of the application of certain embodiments of the invention during a routine follow up a 67 year old patient with congestive heart failure CHF tells his physician that he is following his diet and is limiting salt intake. Three days later he experiences worsening dyspnea difficulty breathing and cannot lie flat in bed. While he normally awakens twice during sleep to urinate he awakens and walks to his living room four times that evening. He returns to bed at 5 00 a.m. and awakens for the day at 6 30 a.m. He normally walks the distance of his driveway to pick up the morning newspaper but fails to do so this morning. His ankles are swollen yet he does not alert his healthcare team. The present system can be programmed to detect a multi variable deviation from his motion signature profile or patient activity signature in terms of multiple night time awakenings early morning awakening and failure to walk the length of his driveway to pick up the newspaper. This triggers a warning on the dashboard and as a result his care coordination nurse calls and discovers that his ankles are swollen he has gained 11 pounds of fluid and that he cannot catch his breath. This triggers an urgent visit to his home where intravenous diuretics are administered for a CHF exacerbation.

In another example of the application of certain embodiments of the invention a 47 year old woman with end stage renal disease presents to dialysis three times each week Monday Wednesday and Friday . On those days she is routinely less active. On the weekend she typically visits her grandchildren and walks with them in the neighborhood park. This Sunday however she awakens at 10 00 a.m. typically 8 00 8 30 a.m. and does not leave her bedroom more than once. The present system can be programmed to detect a multi variable deviation from her motion signature profile or patient activity signature in terms of late awakening and diminished ambulation. This triggers a warning on the dashboard and a call from her care coordinator elicits from her that she is feeling dizzy. She also reports not having visited her grandchildren. She is prompted to visit a local urgent care facility and an element of confusion is noted. Multiple electrolyte abnormalities are detected and she subsequently receives dialysis treatment.

In another example of the application of certain embodiments of the invention a 78 year old man never misses his exercise class held on Tuesdays and Thursdays. This morning he awakens at 8 00 a.m. prepares breakfast and walks around the block as he does each morning. Half way though his walk his gait slows considerably. He does not show up for the exercise class. The present system can be programmed to detect a multi variable deviation from his motion signature profile or patient activity signature in terms of ambulatory slowing and no exercise registered between the hours of 10 30 11 30 a.m. when he otherwise routinely participates in his exercise class. This prompts a call from his care coordinator who notes slurring of speech. She immediately calls 911 an ambulance is dispatched and the patient is admitted to the hospital with an acute stroke.

In another example of the application of certain embodiments of the invention it is 11 00 a.m. and a 74 year old woman with rheumatoid arthritis has not arisen from bed. She normally eats breakfast at 8 00 a.m. No motion has been detected after 3 00 a.m. when she normally awakens to urinate. The present system can be programmed to detect a deviation from her motion signature profile or patient activity signature in terms of no evidence of movement three hours past her typical time of awakening. This prompts a call from her care coordinator but the patient does not answer the phone. The ambulance crew finds her on the floor in her bedroom unable to ambulate. The patient fell experienced a hip fracture and could not reach the phone.

In each of these scenarios an alert is provider to a care coordinator who calls the patient and discovers a health challenge that might otherwise be undetected. While false positives may occur the cost of a phone call is outweighed by the significant potential for early intervention. By developing an individualized motion signature profile or patient activity signature through a progressive series of machine learning algorithms it becomes apparent that simple changes in multiple activity patterns can serve as an early warning system for disease exacerbation or a change in health status. As a direct result care can be instituted with potential life saving impact and improved care experiences can be realized and often at a lower cost than other approaches.

Various embodiments of the systems and methods described herein may employ one or more electronic computer networks to promote communication among different components transfer data or to share resources and information. Such computer networks can be classified according to the hardware and software technology that is used to interconnect the devices in the network such as optical fiber Ethernet wireless LAN HomePNA power line communication or G.hn. The computer networks may also be embodied as one or more of the following types of networks local area network LAN metropolitan area network MAN wide area network WAN virtual private network VPN storage area network SAN or global area network GAN among other network varieties.

For example a WAN computer network may cover a broad area by linking communications across metropolitan regional or national boundaries. The network may use routers and or public communication links. One type of data communication network may cover a relatively broad geographic area e.g. city to city or country to country which uses transmission facilities provided by common carriers such as telephone service providers. In another example a GAN computer network may support mobile communications across multiple wireless LANs or satellite networks. In another example a VPN computer network may include links between nodes carried by open connections or virtual circuits in another network e.g. the Internet instead of by physical wires. The link layer protocols of the VPN can be tunneled through the other network. One VPN application can promote secure communications through the Internet. The VPN can also be used to separately and securely conduct the traffic of different user communities over an underlying network. The VPN may provide users with the virtual experience of accessing the network through an IP address location other than the actual IP address which connects the access device to the network.

The computer network may be characterized based on functional relationships among the elements or components of the network such as active networking client server or peer to peer functional architecture. The computer network may be classified according to network topology such as bus network star network ring network mesh network star bus network or hierarchical topology network for example. The computer network may also be classified based on the method employed for data communication such as digital and analog networks.

Embodiments of the methods and systems described herein may employ internetworking for connecting two or more distinct electronic computer networks or network segments through a common routing technology. The type of internetwork employed may depend on administration and or participation in the internetwork. Non limiting examples of internetworks include intranet extranet and Internet. Intranets and extranets may or may not have connections to the Internet. If connected to the Internet the intranet or extranet may be protected with appropriate authentication technology or other security measures. As applied herein an intranet can be a group of networks which employ Internet Protocol web browsers and or file transfer applications under common control by an administrative entity. Such an administrative entity could restrict access to the intranet to only authorized users for example or another internal network of an organization or commercial entity. As applied herein an extranet may include a network or internetwork generally limited to a primary organization or entity but which also has limited connections to the networks of one or more other trusted organizations or entities e.g. customers of an entity may be given access an intranet of the entity thereby creating an extranet .

Computer networks may include hardware elements to interconnect network nodes such as network interface cards NICs or Ethernet cards repeaters bridges hubs switches routers and other like components. Such elements may be physically wired for communication and or data connections may be provided with microwave links e.g. IEEE 802.12 or fiber optics for example. A network card network adapter or NIC can be designed to allow computers to communicate over the computer network by providing physical access to a network and an addressing system through the use of MAC addresses for example. A repeater can be embodied as an electronic device that receives and retransmits a communicated signal at a boosted power level to allow the signal to cover a telecommunication distance with reduced degradation. A network bridge can be configured to connect multiple network segments at the data link layer of a computer network while learning which addresses can be reached through which specific ports of the network. In the network the bridge may associate a port with an address and then send traffic for that address only to that port. In various embodiments local bridges may be employed to directly connect local area networks LANs remote bridges can be used to create a wide area network WAN link between LANs and or wireless bridges can be used to connect LANs and or to connect remote stations to LANs.

In various embodiments a hub may be employed which contains multiple ports. For example when a data packet arrives at one port of a hub the packet can be copied unmodified to all ports of the hub for transmission. A network switch or other devices that forward and filter OSI layer 2 datagrams between ports based on MAC addresses in data packets can also be used. A switch can possess multiple ports such that most of the network is connected directly to the switch or another switch that is in turn connected to a switch. The term switch can also include routers and bridges as well as other devices that distribute data traffic by application content e.g. a Web URL identifier . Switches may operate at one or more OSI model layers including physical data link network or transport i.e. end to end . A device that operates simultaneously at more than one of these layers can be considered a multilayer switch. In certain embodiments routers or other like networking devices may be used to forward data packets between networks using headers and forwarding tables to determine an optimum path through which to transmit the packets.

As employed herein an application server may be a server that hosts an API to expose business logic and business processes for use by other applications. Examples of application servers include J2EE or Java EE 5 application servers including WebSphere Application Server.

Also application servers may be provided in accordance with the .NET framework including the Windows Communication Foundation .NET Remoting ADO.NET and ASP.NET among several other components. For example a Java Server Page JSP is a servlet that executes in a web container which is functionally equivalent to CGI scripts. JSPs can be used to create HTML pages by embedding references to the server logic within the page. The application servers may mainly serve web based applications while other servers can perform as session initiation protocol servers for instance or work with telephony networks. Specifications for enterprise application integration and service oriented architecture can be designed to connect many different computer network elements. Such specifications include Business Application Programming Interface Web Services Interoperability and Java EE Connector Architecture.

Embodiments of the methods and systems described herein may divide functions between separate CPUs creating a multiprocessing configuration. For example multiprocessor and multi core multiple CPUs on a single integrated circuit computer systems with co processing capabilities may be employed. Also multitasking may be employed as a computer processing technique to handle simultaneous execution of multiple computer programs.

In various embodiments the computer systems data storage media or modules described herein may be configured and or programmed to include one or more of the above described electronic computer based elements and components or computer architecture.
