This patent specification relates to systems and methods for the monitoring and control of energy consuming systems or other resource consuming systems. More particularly this patent specification relates to control units that govern the operation of energy consuming systems household devices or other resource consuming systems including methods for interfacing with boiler based heating systems.

In European countries thermostats generally use a bimetallic strip to sense temperature and respond to temperature changes in the room. The movement of the bimetallic strip is used to directly open and close an electrical circuit. Power is delivered to an electromechanical actuator usually relay or contactor in the boiler equipment whenever the contact was closed to provide heating and or cooling to the controlled space. Since these thermostats do not require electrical power to operate the wiring connections were very simple. A two wire connection typically runs between the thermostat and the boiler system.

In the following detailed description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments of the present invention. Those of ordinary skill in the art will realize that these various embodiments of the present invention are illustrative only and are not intended to be limiting in any way. Other embodiments of the present invention will readily suggest themselves to such skilled persons having the benefit of this disclosure. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances well known details have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention.

In addition for clarity purposes not all of the routine features of the embodiments described herein are shown or described. One of ordinary skill in the art would readily appreciate that in the development of any such actual embodiment numerous embodiment specific decisions may be required to achieve specific design objectives. These design objectives will vary from one embodiment to another and from one developer to another. Moreover it will be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time consuming but would nevertheless be a routine engineering undertaking for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.

It is to be appreciated that while one or more embodiments are described further herein in the context of typical HVAC system used in a residential home such as single family residential home the scope of the present teachings is not so limited. More generally intelligent thermostat systems according to one or more of the embodiments are applicable for a wide variety of enclosures having one or more HVAC systems including without limitation duplexes townhomes multi unit apartment buildings hotels retail stores office buildings and industrial buildings. Further it is to be appreciated that while the terms user customer installer homeowner occupant guest tenant landlord repair person and or the like may be used to refer to the person or persons who are interacting with the thermostat or other device or user interface in the context of one or more scenarios described herein these references are by no means to be considered as limiting the scope of the present teachings with respect to the person or persons who are performing such actions.

Provided according to one or more embodiments are methods and systems for setting up pairing controlling and or programming one or more of intelligent network connected intelligent thermostat systems. These intelligent thermostat systems may be configured and adapted to be implemented in a smart home environment seamlessly interacting with other devices in the smart home environment. The term intelligent thermostat systems is used herein to represent a particular combination of devices that can be configured to control an HVAC system in an enclosure e.g. a home an office or another structure. However this intelligent thermostat systems may also be capable of controlling other devices controlling non HVAC systems and events e.g. security related events and or working in cooperation with other devices to provide additional features to the smart home environment. Again it is within the scope of the present teachings for embodiments of the intelligent thermostat systems of the present invention to detect measurable characteristics other than environmental conditions e.g. pressure flow rate height position velocity acceleration capacity power loudness and brightness and monitor and or respond to one or more measurable characteristics of one or more physical systems.

It is to be appreciated that smart home environments may refer to smart environments for homes such as a single family house but the scope of the present teachings is not so limited the present teachings being likewise applicable without limitation to duplexes townhomes multi unit apartment buildings hotels retail stores office buildings industrial buildings and more generally any living space or work space having one or more smart hazard detectors.

It is to be further appreciated that while the terms user customer installer homeowner occupant guest tenant landlord repair person and the like may be used to refer to the person or persons who are interacting with the smart hazard detector or user interface in the context of some particularly advantageous situations described herein these references are by no means to be considered as limiting the scope of the present teachings with respect to the person or persons who are performing such actions. Thus for example the terms user customer purchaser installer subscriber and homeowner may often refer to the same person in the case of a single family residential dwelling because the head of the household is often the person who makes the purchasing decision buys the unit and installs and configures the unit and is also one of the users of the unit. However in other scenarios such as a landlord tenant environment the customer may be the landlord with respect to purchasing the unit the installer may be a local apartment supervisor a first user may be the tenant and a second user may again be the landlord with respect to remote control functionality. Importantly while the identity of the person performing the action may be germane to a particular advantage provided by one or more of the embodiments for example the password protected hazard detection functionality described further herein may be particularly advantageous where the landlord holds the sole password and can control hazard detection via the hazard detection device such identity should not be construed in the descriptions that follow as necessarily limiting the scope of the present teachings to those particular individuals having those particular identities.

The detailed description includes two subsections 1 an overview of smart home device networks and capabilities and 2 a detailed description of an intelligent thermostat system for controlling boiler based heating systems. The first subsection provides a description of the capabilities of the smart home devices. The second subsection provides a detailed description an intelligent thermostat system comprising a head unit a backplate and a base unit along with methods for installation setup and or controlling a boiler based heater.

Turning to the figures illustrates an example of a smart home environment within which one or more of the devices methods systems services and or computer program products described further herein can be applicable. The depicted smart home environment includes a structure which can include e.g. a house office building garage or mobile home. It will be appreciated that devices can also be integrated into a smart home environment that does not include an entire structure such as an apartment condominium or office space. Further the smart home environment can control and or be coupled to devices outside of the actual structure . Indeed several devices in the smart home environment need not physically be within the structure at all. For example a device controlling a pool heater or irrigation system can be located outside of the structure .

The depicted structure includes a plurality of rooms separated at least partly from each other via walls . The walls can include interior walls or exterior walls. Each room can further include a floor and a ceiling . Devices can be mounted on integrated with and or supported by a wall floor or ceiling .

In some embodiments the smart home environment of includes a plurality of devices including intelligent multi sensing network connected devices that can integrate seamlessly with each other and or with a central server or a cloud computing system to provide any of a variety of useful smart home objectives. The smart home environment may include one or more intelligent multi sensing network connected thermostats hereinafter referred to as smart thermostats one or more intelligent network connected multi sensing hazard detection units hereinafter referred to as smart hazard detectors and one or more intelligent multi sensing network connected entryway interface devices hereinafter referred to as smart doorbells . According to embodiments the smart thermostat detects ambient climate characteristics e.g. temperature and or humidity and controls a HVAC system accordingly. The smart hazard detector may detect the presence of a hazardous substance or a substance indicative of a hazardous substance e.g. smoke fire or carbon monoxide . The smart doorbell may detect a person s approach to or departure from a location e.g. an outer door control doorbell functionality announce a person s approach or departure via audio or visual means or control settings on a security system e.g. to activate or deactivate the security system when occupants go and come .

In some embodiments the smart home environment of further includes one or more intelligent multi sensing network connected wall switches hereinafter referred to as smart wall switches along with one or more intelligent multi sensing network connected wall plug interfaces hereinafter referred to as smart wall plugs . The smart wall switches may detect ambient lighting conditions detect room occupancy states and control a power and or dim state of one or more lights. In some instances smart wall switches may also control a power state or speed of a fan such as a ceiling fan. The smart wall plugs may detect occupancy of a room or enclosure and control supply of power to one or more wall plugs e.g. such that power is not supplied to the plug if nobody is at home .

Still further in some embodiments the smart home environment of includes a plurality of intelligent multi sensing network connected appliances hereinafter referred to as smart appliances such as refrigerators stoves and or ovens televisions washers dryers lights stereos intercom systems garage door openers floor fans ceiling fans wall air conditioners pool heaters irrigation systems security systems and so forth. According to embodiments the network connected appliances are made compatible with the smart home environment by cooperating with the respective manufacturers of the appliances. For example the appliances can be space heaters window AC units motorized duct vents etc. When plugged in an appliance can announce itself to the smart home network such as by indicating what type of appliance it is and it can automatically integrate with the controls of the smart home. Such communication by the appliance to the smart home can be facilitated by any wired or wireless communication protocols known by those having ordinary skill in the art. The smart home also can include a variety of non communicating legacy appliances such as old conventional washer dryers refrigerators and the like which can be controlled albeit coarsely ON OFF by virtue of the smart wall plugs . The smart home environment can further include a variety of partially communicating legacy appliances such as infrared IR controlled wall air conditioners or other IR controlled devices which can be controlled by IR signals provided by the smart hazard detectors or the smart wall switches .

According to embodiments the smart thermostats the smart hazard detectors the smart doorbells the smart wall switches the smart wall plugs and other devices of the smart home environment are modular and can be incorporated into older and new houses. For example the devices are designed around a modular platform consisting of two basic components a head unit and a backplate which is also referred to as a docking station. Multiple configurations of the docking station are provided so as to be compatible with any home such as older and newer homes. However all of the docking stations include a standard head connection arrangement such that any head unit can be removably attached to any docking station. Thus in some embodiments the docking stations are interfaces that serve as physical connections to the structure and the voltage wiring of the homes and the interchangeable head units contain all of the sensors processors user interfaces the batteries and other functional components of the devices.

Many different commercial and functional possibilities for provisioning maintenance and upgrade are possible. For example after years of using any particular head unit a user will be able to buy a new version of the head unit and simply plug it into the old docking station. There are also many different versions for the head units such as low cost versions with few features and then a progression of increasingly capable versions up to and including extremely fancy head units with a large number of features. Thus it should be appreciated that the various versions of the head units can all be interchangeable with any of them working when placed into any docking station. This can advantageously encourage sharing and re deployment of old head units for example when an important high capability head unit such as a hazard detector is replaced by a new version of the head unit then the old head unit can be re deployed to a backroom or basement etc. According to embodiments when first plugged into a docking station the head unit can ask the user by 2D LCD display 2D 3D holographic projection voice interaction etc. a few simple questions such as Where am I and the user can indicate living room kitchen and so forth.

The smart home environment may also include communication with devices outside of the physical home but within a proximate geographical range of the home. For example the smart home environment may include a pool heater monitor that communicates a current pool temperature to other devices within the smart home environment or receives commands for controlling the pool temperature. Similarly the smart home environment may include an irrigation monitor that communicates information regarding irrigation systems within the smart home environment and or receives control information for controlling such irrigation systems. According to embodiments an algorithm is provided for considering the geographic location of the smart home environment such as based on the zip code or geographic coordinates of the home. The geographic information is then used to obtain data helpful for determining optimal times for watering such data may include sun location information temperature due point soil type of the land on which the home is located etc.

By virtue of network connectivity one or more of the smart home devices of can further allow a user to interact with the device even if the user is not proximate to the device. For example a user can communicate with a device using a computer e.g. a desktop computer laptop computer or tablet or other portable electronic device e.g. a smartphone . A webpage or app can be configured to receive communications from the user and control the device based on the communications and or to present information about the device s operation to the user. For example the user can view a current setpoint temperature for a device and adjust it using a computer. The user can be in the structure during this remote communication or outside the structure.

As discussed users can control the smart thermostat and other smart devices in the smart home environment using a network connected computer or portable electronic device . In some examples some or all of the occupants e.g. individuals who live in the home can register their device with the smart home environment . Such registration can be made at a central server to authenticate the occupant and or the device as being associated with the home and to give permission to the occupant to use the device to control the smart devices in the home. An occupant can use their registered device to remotely control the smart devices of the home such as when the occupant is at work or on vacation. The occupant may also use their registered device to control the smart devices when the occupant is actually located inside the home such as when the occupant is sitting on a couch inside the home. It should be appreciated that instead of or in addition to registering devices the smart home environment makes inferences about which individuals live in the home and are therefore occupants and which devices are associated with those individuals. As such the smart home environment learns who is an occupant and permits the devices associated with those individuals to control the smart devices of the home.

In some instances guests desire to control the smart devices. For example the smart home environment may receive communication from an unregistered mobile device of an individual inside of the home where said individual is not recognized as an occupant of the home. Further for example a smart home environment may receive communication from a mobile device of an individual who is known to be or who is registered as a guest.

According to embodiments a guest layer of controls can be provided to guests of the smart home environment . The guest layer of controls gives guests access to basic controls e.g. a judicially selected subset of features of the smart devices such as temperature adjustments but it locks out other functionalities. The guest layer of controls can be thought of as a safe sandbox in which guests have limited controls but they do not have access to more advanced controls that could fundamentally alter undermine damage or otherwise impair the occupant desired operation of the smart devices. For example the guest layer of controls will not permit the guest to adjust the heat pump lockout temperature.

A use case example of this is when a guest is in a smart home the guest could walk up to the thermostat and turn the dial manually but the guest may not want to walk around the house hunting the thermostat especially at night while the home is dark and others are sleeping. Further the guest may not want to go through the hassle of downloading the necessary application to their device for remotely controlling the thermostat. In fact the guest may not have the home owner s login credentials etc. and therefore cannot remotely control the thermostat via such an application. Accordingly according to embodiments of the invention the guest can open a mobile browser on their mobile device type a keyword such as NEST into the URL field and tap Go or Search etc. In response the device presents the guest with a user interface which allows the guest to move the target temperature between a limited range such as 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. As discussed the user interface provides a guest layer of controls that are limited to basic functions. The guest cannot change the target humidity modes or view energy history.

According to embodiments to enable guests to access the user interface that provides the guest layer of controls a local webserver is provided that is accessible in the local area network LAN . It does not require a password because physical presence inside the home is established reliably enough by the guest s presence on the LAN. In some embodiments during installation of the smart device such as the smart thermostat the home owner is asked if they want to enable a Local Web App LWA on the smart device. Business owners will likely say no home owners will likely say yes. When the LWA option is selected the smart device broadcasts to the LAN that the above referenced keyword such as NEST is now a host alias for its local web server. Thus no matter whose home a guest goes to that same keyword e.g. NEST is always the URL you use to access the LWA provided the smart device is purchased from the same manufacturer. Further according to embodiments if there is more than one smart device on the LAN the second and subsequent smart devices do not offer to set up another LWA. Instead they register themselves as target candidates with the master LWA. And in this case the LWA user would be asked which smart device they want to change the temperature on before getting the simplified user interface for the particular smart device they choose.

According to embodiments a guest layer of controls may also be provided to users by means other than a device . For example the smart device such as the smart thermostat may be equipped with walkup identification technology e.g. face recognition RFID ultrasonic sensors that fingerprints or creates a signature for the occupants of the home. The walkup identification technology can be the same as or similar to the fingerprinting and signature creating techniques descripted in other sections of this application. In operation when a person who does not live in the home or is otherwise not registered with the smart home or whose fingerprint or signature is not recognized by the smart home walks up to a smart device the smart device provides the guest with the guest layer of controls rather than full controls.

As described below the smart thermostat and other smart devices learn by observing occupant behavior. For example the smart thermostat learns occupants preferred temperature set points for mornings and evenings and it learns when the occupants are asleep or awake as well as when the occupants are typically away or at home for example. According to embodiments when a guest controls the smart devices such as the smart thermostat the smart devices do not learn from the guest. This prevents the guest s adjustments and controls from affecting the learned preferences of the occupants.

According to some embodiments a smart television remote control is provided. The smart remote control recognizes occupants by thumbprint visual identification RFID etc. and it recognizes a user as a guest or as someone belonging to a particular class having limited control and access e.g. child . Upon recognizing the user as a guest or someone belonging to a limited class the smart remote control only permits that user to view a subset of channels and to make limited adjustments to the settings of the television and other devices. For example a guest cannot adjust the digital video recorder DVR settings and a child is limited to viewing child appropriate programming.

According to some embodiments similar controls are provided for other instruments utilities and devices in the house. For example sinks bathtubs and showers can be controlled by smart spigots that recognize users as guests or as children and therefore prevent water from exceeding a designated temperature that is considered safe.

In some embodiments in addition to containing processing and sensing capabilities each of the devices and collectively referred to as the smart devices is capable of data communications and information sharing with any other of the smart devices as well as to any central server or cloud computing system or any other device that is network connected anywhere in the world. The required data communications can be carried out using any of a variety of custom or standard wireless protocols Wi Fi ZigBee 6LoWPAN etc. and or any of a variety of custom or standard wired protocols CAT6 Ethernet HomePlug etc. 

According to embodiments all or some of the smart devices can serve as wireless or wired repeaters. For example a first one of the smart devices can communicate with a second one of the smart device via a wireless router . The smart devices can further communicate with each other via a connection to a network such as the Internet . Through the Internet the smart devices can communicate with a central server or a cloud computing system . The central server or cloud computing system can be associated with a manufacturer support entity or service provider associated with the device. For one embodiment a user may be able to contact customer support using a device itself rather than needing to use other communication means such as a telephone or Internet connected computer. Further software updates can be automatically sent from the central server or cloud computing system to devices e.g. when available when purchased or at routine intervals .

According to embodiments the smart devices combine to create a mesh network of spokesman and low power nodes in the smart home environment where some of the smart devices are spokesman nodes and others are low powered nodes. Some of the smart devices in the smart home environment are battery powered while others have a regular and reliable power source such as by connecting to wiring e.g. to 120V line voltage wires behind the walls of the smart home environment. The smart devices that have a regular and reliable power source are referred to as spokesman nodes. These nodes are equipped with the capability of using any wireless protocol or manner to facilitate bidirectional communication with any of a variety of other devices in the smart home environment as well as with the central server or cloud computing system . On the other hand the devices that are battery powered are referred to as low power nodes. These nodes tend to be smaller than spokesman nodes and can only communicate using wireless protocols that requires very little power such as Zigbee 6LoWPAN etc. Further some but not all low power nodes are incapable of bidirectional communication. These low power nodes send messages but they are unable to listen . Thus other devices in the smart home environment such as the spokesman nodes cannot send information to these low power nodes.

As described the smart devices serve as low power and spokesman nodes to create a mesh network in the smart home environment . Individual low power nodes in the smart home environment regularly send out messages regarding what they are sensing and the other low powered nodes in the smart home environment in addition to sending out their own messages repeat the messages thereby causing the messages to travel from node to node i.e. device to device throughout the smart home environment . The spokesman nodes in the smart home environment are able to drop down to low powered communication protocols to receive these messages translate the messages to other communication protocols and send the translated messages to other spokesman nodes and or the central server or cloud computing system . Thus the low powered nodes using low power communication protocols are able send messages across the entire smart home environment as well as over the Internet to the central server or cloud computing system . According to embodiments the mesh network enables the central server or cloud computing system regularly receive data from all of the smart devices in the home make inferences based on the data and send commands back to one of the smart devices to accomplish some of the smart home objectives descried herein.

As described the spokesman nodes and some of the low powered nodes are capable of listening . Accordingly users other devices and the central server or cloud computing system can communicate controls to the low powered nodes. For example a user can use the portable electronic device e.g. a smartphone to send commands over the Internet to the central server or cloud computing system which then relays the commands to the spokesman nodes in the smart home environment . The spokesman nodes drop down to a low power protocol to communicate the commands to the low power nodes throughout the smart home environment as well as to other spokesman nodes that did not receive the commands directly from the central server or cloud computing system .

An example of a low power node is a smart nightlight . In addition to housing a light source the smart nightlight houses an occupancy sensor such as an ultrasonic or passive IR sensor and an ambient light sensor such as a photo resistor or a single pixel sensor that measures light in the room. In some embodiments the smart nightlight is configured to activate the light source when its ambient light sensor detects that the room is dark and when its occupancy sensor detects that someone is in the room. In other embodiments the smart nightlight is simply configured to activate the light source when its ambient light sensor detects that the room is dark. Further according to embodiments the smart nightlight includes a low power wireless communication chip e.g. ZigBee chip that regularly sends out messages regarding the occupancy of the room and the amount of light in the room including instantaneous messages coincident with the occupancy sensor detecting the presence of a person in the room. As mentioned above these messages may be sent wirelessly using the mesh network from node to node i.e. smart device to smart device within the smart home environment as well as over the Internet to the central server or cloud computing system .

Other examples of low powered nodes include battery operated versions of the smart hazard detectors . These smart hazard detectors are often located in an area without access to constant and reliable power and as discussed in detail below may include any number and type of sensors such as smoke fire heat sensors carbon monoxide dioxide sensors occupancy motion sensors ambient light sensors temperature sensors humidity sensors and the like. Furthermore smart hazard detectors can send messages that correspond to each of the respective sensors to the other devices and the central server or cloud computing system such as by using the mesh network as described above.

Examples of spokesman nodes include smart doorbells smart thermostats smart wall switches and smart wall plugs . These devices and are often located near and connected to a reliable power source and therefore can include more power consuming components such as one or more communication chips capable of bidirectional communication in any variety of protocols.

In some embodiments these low powered and spokesman nodes e.g. devices and can function as tripwires for an alarm system in the smart home environment. For example in the event a perpetrator circumvents detection by alarm sensors located at windows doors and other entry points of the smart home environment the alarm could be triggered upon receiving an occupancy motion heat sound etc. message from one or more of the low powered and spokesman nodes in the mesh network. For example upon receiving a message from a smart nightlight indicating the presence of a person the central server or cloud computing system or some other device could trigger an alarm provided the alarm is armed at the time of detection. Thus the alarm system could be enhanced by various low powered and spokesman nodes located throughout the smart home environment . In this example a user could enhance the security of the smart home environment by buying and installing extra smart nightlights .

In some embodiments the mesh network can be used to automatically turn on and off lights as a person transitions from room to room. For example the low powered and spokesman nodes e.g. devices and detect the person s movement through the smart home environment and communicate corresponding messages through the mesh network. Using the messages that indicate which rooms are occupied the central server or cloud computing system or some other device activates and deactivates the smart wall switches to automatically provide light as the person moves from room to room in the smart home environment . Further users may provide pre configuration information that indicates which smart wall plugs provide power to lamps and other light sources such as the smart nightlight . Alternatively this mapping of light sources to wall plugs can be done automatically e.g. the smart wall plugs detect when a light source is plugged into it and it sends a corresponding message to the central server or cloud computing system . Using this mapping information in combination with messages that indicate which rooms are occupied the central server or cloud computing system or some other device activates and deactivates the smart wall plugs that provide power to lamps and other light sources so as to track the person s movement and provide light as the person moves from room to room.

In some embodiments the mesh network of low powered and spokesman nodes can be used to provide exit lighting in the event of an emergency. In some instances to facilitate this users provide pre configuration information that indicates exit routes in the smart home environment . For example for each room in the house the user provides a map of the best exit route. It should be appreciated that instead of a user providing this information the central server or cloud computing system or some other device could automatically determine the routes using uploaded maps diagrams architectural drawings of the smart home house as well as using a map generated based on positional information obtained from the nodes of the mesh network e.g. positional information from the devices is used to construct a map of the house . In operation when an alarm is activated e.g. when one or more of the smart hazard detector detects smoke and activates an alarm the central server or cloud computing system or some other device uses occupancy information obtained from the low powered and spokesman nodes to determine which rooms are occupied and then turns on lights e.g. nightlights wall switches wall plugs that power lamps etc. along the exit routes from the occupied rooms so as to provide emergency exit lighting.

Further included and illustrated in the exemplary smart home environment of are service robots each configured to carry out in an autonomous manner any of a variety of household tasks. For some embodiments the service robots can be respectively configured to perform floor sweeping floor washing etc. in a manner similar to that of known commercially available devices such as the ROOMBA and SCOOBA products sold by iRobot Inc. of Bedford Mass. Tasks such as floor sweeping and floor washing can be considered as away or while away tasks for purposes of the instant description as it is generally more desirable for these tasks to be performed when the occupants are not present. For other embodiments one or more of the service robots are configured to perform tasks such as playing music for an occupant serving as a localized thermostat for an occupant serving as a localized air monitor purifier for an occupant serving as a localized baby monitor serving as a localized hazard detector for an occupant and so forth it being generally more desirable for such tasks to be carried out in the immediate presence of the human occupant. For purposes of the instant description such tasks can be considered as human facing or human centric tasks.

When serving as a localized thermostat for an occupant a particular one of the service robots can be considered to be facilitating what can be called a personal comfort area network for the occupant with the objective being to keep the occupant s immediate space at a comfortable temperature wherever that occupant may be located in the home. This can be contrasted with conventional wall mounted room thermostats which have the more attenuated objective of keeping a statically defined structural space at a comfortable temperature. According to one embodiment the localized thermostat service robot is configured to move itself into the immediate presence e.g. within five feet of a particular occupant who has settled into a particular location in the home e.g. in the dining room to eat their breakfast and read the news . The localized thermostat service robot includes a temperature sensor a processor and wireless communication components configured such that control communications with the HVAC system either directly or through a wall mounted wirelessly communicating thermostat coupled to the HVAC system are maintained and such that the temperature in the immediate vicinity of the occupant is maintained at their desired level. If the occupant then moves and settles into another location e.g. to the living room couch to watch television the localized thermostat service robot proceeds to move and park itself next to the couch and keep that particular immediate space at a comfortable temperature.

Technologies by which the localized thermostat service robot and or the larger smart home system of can identify and locate the occupant whose personal area space is to be kept at a comfortable temperature can include but are not limited to RFID sensing e.g. person having an RFID bracelet RFID necklace or RFID key fob synthetic vision techniques e.g. video cameras and face recognition processors audio techniques e.g. voice sound pattern vibration pattern recognition ultrasound sensing imaging techniques and infrared or near field communication NFC techniques e.g. person wearing an infrared or NFC capable smartphone along with rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence techniques that draw useful conclusions from the sensed information e.g. if there is only a single occupant present in the home then that is the person whose immediate space should be kept at a comfortable temperature and the selection of the desired comfortable temperature should correspond to that occupant s particular stored profile .

When serving as a localized air monitor purifier for an occupant a particular service robot can be considered to be facilitating what can be called a personal health area network for the occupant with the objective being to keep the air quality in the occupant s immediate space at healthy levels. Alternatively or in conjunction therewith other health related functions can be provided such as monitoring the temperature or heart rate of the occupant e.g. using finely remote sensors near field communication with on person monitors etc. . When serving as a localized hazard detector for an occupant a particular service robot can be considered to be facilitating what can be called a personal safety area network for the occupant with the objective being to ensure there is no excessive carbon monoxide smoke fire etc. in the immediate space of the occupant. Methods analogous to those described above for personal comfort area networks in terms of occupant identifying and tracking are likewise applicable for personal health area network and personal safety area network embodiments.

According to some embodiments the above referenced facilitation of personal comfort area networks personal health area networks personal safety area networks and or other such human facing functionalities of the service robots are further enhanced by logical integration with other smart sensors in the home according to rules based inferencing techniques or artificial intelligence techniques for achieving better performance of those human facing functionalities and or for achieving those goals in energy conserving or other resource conserving ways. Thus for one embodiment relating to personal health area networks the air monitor purifier service robot can be configured to detect whether a household pet is moving toward the currently settled location of the occupant e.g. using onboard sensors and or by data communications with other smart home sensors along with rules based inferencing artificial intelligence techniques and if so the air purifying rate is immediately increased in preparation for the arrival of more airborne pet dander. For another embodiment relating to personal safety area networks the hazard detector service robot can be advised by other smart home sensors that the temperature and humidity levels are rising in the kitchen which is nearby to the occupant s current dining room location and responsive to this advisory the hazard detector service robot will temporarily raise a hazard detection threshold such as a smoke detection threshold under an inference that any small increases in ambient smoke levels will most likely be due to cooking activity and not due to a genuinely hazardous condition.

The above described human facing and away functionalities can be provided without limitation by multiple distinct service robots having respective dedicated ones of such functionalities by a single service robot having an integration of two or more different ones of such functionalities and or any combinations thereof including the ability for a single service robot to have both away and human facing functionalities without departing from the scope of the present teachings. Electrical power can be provided by virtue of rechargeable batteries or other rechargeable methods with illustrating an exemplary out of the way docking station to which the service robots will automatically dock and recharge its batteries if needed during periods of inactivity. Preferably each service robot includes wireless communication components that facilitate data communications with one or more of the other wirelessly communicating smart home sensors of and or with one or more other service robots e.g. using Wi Fi Zigbee Z Wave 6LoWPAN etc. and one or more of the smart home devices of can be in communication with a remote server over the Internet. Alternatively or in conjunction therewith each service robot can be configured to communicate directly with a remote server by virtue of cellular telephone communications satellite communications 3G 4G network data communications or other direct communication method.

Provided according to some embodiments are systems and methods relating to the integration of the service robot s with home security sensors and related functionalities of the smart home system. The embodiments are particularly applicable and advantageous when applied for those service robots that perform away functionalities or that otherwise are desirable to be active when the home is unoccupied hereinafter away service robots . Included in the embodiments are methods and systems for ensuring that home security systems intrusion detection systems and or occupancy sensitive environmental control systems for example occupancy sensitive automated setback thermostats that enter into a lower energy using condition when the home is unoccupied are not erroneously triggered by the away service robots.

Provided according to one embodiment is a home automation and security system e.g. as shown in that is remotely monitored by a monitoring service by virtue of automated systems e.g. cloud based servers or other central servers hereinafter central server that are in data communications with one or more network connected elements of the home automation and security system. The away service robots are configured to be in operative data communication with the central server and are configured such that they remain in a non away service state e.g. a dormant state at their docking station unless permission is granted from the central server e.g. by virtue of an away service OK message from the central server to commence their away service activities. An away state determination made by the system which can be arrived at i exclusively by local on premises smart device s based on occupancy sensor data ii exclusively by the central server based on received occupancy sensor data and or based on received proximity related information such as GPS coordinates from user smartphones or automobiles or iii any combination of i and ii can then trigger the granting of away service permission to the away service robots by the central server. During the course of the away service robot activity during which the away service robots may continuously detect and send their in home location coordinates to the central server the central server can readily filter signals from the occupancy sensing devices to distinguish between the away service robot activity versus any unexpected intrusion activity thereby avoiding a false intrusion alarm condition while also ensuring that the home is secure. Alternatively or in conjunction therewith the central server may provide filtering data such as an expected occupancy sensing profile triggered by the away service robots to the occupancy sensing nodes or associated processing nodes of the smart home such that the filtering is performed at the local level. Although somewhat less secure it would also be within the scope of the present teachings for the central server to temporarily disable the occupancy sensing equipment for the duration of the away service robot activity.

According to another embodiment functionality similar to that of the central server in the above example can be performed by an on site computing device such as a dedicated server computer a master home automation console or panel or as an adjunct function of one or more of the smart home devices of . In such an embodiment there would be no dependency on a remote service provider to provide the away service OK permission to the away service robots and the false alarm avoidance filtering service or filter information for the sensed intrusion detection signals.

According to other embodiments there are provided methods and systems for implementing away service robot functionality while avoiding false home security alarms and false occupancy sensitive environmental controls without the requirement of a single overall event orchestrator. For purposes of the simplicity in the present disclosure the home security systems and or occupancy sensitive environmental controls that would be triggered by the motion noise vibrations or other disturbances of the away service robot activity are referenced simply as activity sensing systems and when so triggered will yield a disturbance detected outcome representative of the false trigger for example an alarm message to a security service or an arrival determination for an automated setback thermostat that causes the home to be heated or cooled to a more comfortable occupied setpoint temperature . According to one embodiment the away service robots are configured to emit a standard ultrasonic sound throughout the course of their away service activity the activity sensing systems are configured to detect that standard ultrasonic sound and the activity sensing systems are further configured such that no disturbance detected outcome will occur for as long as that standard ultrasonic sound is detected. For other embodiments the away service robots are configured to emit a standard notification signal throughout the course of their away service activity the activity sensing systems are configured to detect that standard notification signal and the activity sensing systems are further configured such that no disturbance detected outcome will occur for as long as that standard notification signal is detected where the standard notification signal comprises one or more of an optical notifying signal an audible notifying signal an infrared notifying signal an infrasonic notifying signal a wirelessly transmitted data notification signal e.g. an IP broadcast multicast or unicast notification signal or a notification message sent in an TCP IP two way communication session .

According to some embodiments the notification signals sent by the away service robots to the activity sensing systems are authenticated and encrypted such that the notifications cannot be learned and replicated by a potential burglar. Any of a variety of known encryption authentication schemes can be used to ensure such data security including but not limited to methods involving third party data security services or certificate authorities. For some embodiments a permission request response model can be used where any particular away service robot requests permission from each activity sensing system in the home when it is ready to perform its away service tasks and does not initiate such activity until receiving a yes or permission granted message from each activity sensing system or from a single activity sensing system serving as a spokesman for all of the activity sensing systems . One advantage of the described embodiments that do not require a central event orchestrator is that there can optionally be more of an arms length relationship between the supplier s of the home security environmental control equipment on the one hand and the supplier s of the away service robot s on the other hand as it is only required that there is the described standard one way notification protocol or the described standard two way request permission protocol to be agreed upon by the respective suppliers.

According to still other embodiments the activity sensing systems are configured to detect sounds vibrations RF emissions or other detectable environmental signals or signatures that are intrinsically associated with the away service activity of each away service robot and are further configured such that no disturbance detected outcome will occur for as long as that particular detectable signal or environmental signature is detected. By way of example a particular kind of vacuum cleaning away service robot may emit a specific sound or RF signature. For one embodiment the away service environmental signatures for each of a plurality of known away service robots are stored in the memory of the activity sensing systems based on empirically collected data the environmental signatures being supplied with the activity sensing systems and periodically updated by a remote update server. For another embodiment the activity sensing systems can be placed into a training mode for the particular home in which they are installed wherein they listen and learn the particular environmental signatures of the away service robots for that home during that training session and thereafter will suppress disturbance detected outcomes for intervals in which those environmental signatures are heard.

For still another embodiment which is particularly useful when the activity sensing system is associated with occupancy sensitive environmental control equipment rather than a home security system the activity sensing system is configured to automatically learn the environmental signatures for the away service robots by virtue of automatically performing correlations over time between detected environmental signatures and detected occupancy activity. By way of example for one embodiment an intelligent automated nonoccupancy triggered setback thermostat such as the Nest Learning Thermostat can be configured to constantly monitor for audible and RF activity as well as to perform infrared based occupancy detection. In particular view of the fact that the environmental signature of the away service robot will remain relatively constant from event to event and in view of the fact that the away service events will likely either a themselves be triggered by some sort of nonoccupancy condition as measured by the away service robots themselves or b occur at regular times of day there will be patterns in the collected data by which the events themselves will become apparent and for which the environmental signatures can be readily learned. Generally speaking for this automatic learning embodiment in which the environmental signatures of the away service robots are automatically learned without requiring user interaction it is more preferable that a certain number of false triggers be tolerable over the course of the learning process. Accordingly this automatic learning embodiment is more preferable for application in occupancy sensitive environmental control equipment such as an automated setback thermostat rather than home security systems for the reason that a few false occupancy determinations may cause a few instances of unnecessary heating or cooling but will not otherwise have any serious consequences whereas false home security alarms may have more serious consequences.

According to embodiments technologies including the sensors of the smart devices located in the mesh network of the smart home environment in combination with rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence provided at the central server or cloud computing system are used to provide a personal smart alarm clock for individual occupants of the home. For example user occupants can communicate with the central server or cloud computing system via their mobile devices to access an interface for the smart alarm clock. There occupants can turn on their smart alarm clock and input a wake time for the next day and or for additional days. In some embodiments the occupant may have the option of setting a specific wake time for each day of the week as well as the option of setting some or all of the inputted wake times to repeat . Artificial intelligence will be used to consider the occupant s response to these alarms when they go off and make inferences about the user s preferred sleep patterns over time.

According to embodiments the smart device in the smart home environment that happens to be closest to the occupant when the occupant falls asleep will be the device that transmits messages regarding when the occupant stopped moving from which the central server or cloud computing system will make inferences about where and when the occupant prefers to sleep. This closest smart device will as be the device that sounds the alarm to wake the occupant. In this manner the smart alarm clock will follow the occupant throughout the house by tracking the individual occupants based on their unique signature which is determined based on data obtained from sensors located in the smart devices. For example the sensors include ultrasonic sensors passive IR sensors and the like. The unique signature is based on a combination of walking gate patterns of movement voice height size etc. It should be appreciated that facial recognition may also be used.

According to an embodiment the wake times associated with the smart alarm clock are used by the smart thermostat to control the HVAC in an efficient manner so as to pre heat or cool the house to the occupant s desired sleeping and awake temperature settings. The preferred settings can be learned over time such as by observing which temperature the occupant sets the thermostat to before going to sleep and which temperature the occupant sets the thermostat to upon waking up.

According to an embodiment a device is positioned proximate to the occupant s bed such as on an adjacent nightstand and collects data as the occupant sleeps using noise sensors motion sensors e.g. ultrasonic IR and optical etc. Data may be obtained by the other smart devices in the room as well. Such data may include the occupant s breathing patterns heart rate movement etc. Inferences are made based on this data in combination with data that indicates when the occupant actually wakes up. For example if on a regular basis the occupant s heart rate breathing and moving all increase by 5 to 10 twenty to thirty minutes before the occupant wakes up each morning then predictions can be made regarding when the occupant is going to wake. Other devices in the home can use these predictions to provide other smart home objectives such as adjusting the smart thermostat so as to pre heat or cool the home to the occupant s desired setting before the occupant wakes up. Further these predictions can be used to set the smart alarm clock for the occupant to turn on lights etc.

According to embodiments technologies including the sensors of the smart devices located throughout the smart home environment in combination with rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence provided at the central server or cloud computing system are used to detect or monitor the progress of Alzheimer s Disease. For example the unique signatures of the occupants are used to track the individual occupants movement throughout the smart home environment . This data can be aggregated and analyzed to identify patterns indicative of Alzheimer s. Oftentimes individuals with Alzheimer s have distinctive patterns of migration in their homes. For example a person will walk to the kitchen and stand there for a while then to the living room and stand there for a while and then back to the kitchen. This pattern will take about thirty minutes and then the person will repeat the pattern. According to embodiments the remote servers or cloud computing architectures analyze the person s migration data collected by the mesh network of the smart home environment to identify such patterns.

Although in some examples provided herein the devices and services platform communicates with and collects data from the smart devices of smart home environment of it should be appreciated that the devices and services platform communicates with and collects data from a plurality of smart home environments across the world. For example the central server or cloud computing system can collect home data from the devices of one or more smart home environments where the devices can routinely transmit home data or can transmit home data in specific instances e.g. when a device queries the home data . Thus the devices and services platform routinely collects data from homes across the world. As described the collected home data includes for example power consumption data occupancy data HVAC settings and usage data carbon monoxide levels data carbon dioxide levels data volatile organic compounds levels data sleeping schedule data cooking schedule data inside and outside temperature humidity data television viewership data inside and outside noise level data etc.

The central server or cloud computing architecture can further provide one or more services . The services can include e.g. software updates customer support sensor data collection logging remote access remote or distributed control or use suggestions e.g. based on collected home data to improve performance reduce utility cost etc. . Data associated with the services can be stored at the central server or cloud computing system and the central server or the cloud computing system can retrieve and transmit the data at an appropriate time e.g. at regular intervals upon receiving a request from a user etc. .

As illustrated in an embodiment of the extensible devices and services platform includes a processing engine which can be concentrated at a single server or distributed among several different computing entities without limitation. The processing engine can include engines configured to receive data from devices of smart home environments e.g. via the Internet or a hubbed network to index the data to analyze the data and or to generate statistics based on the analysis or as part of the analysis. The analyzed data can be stored as derived home data .

Results of the analysis or statistics can thereafter be transmitted back to the device that provided home data used to derive the results to other devices to a server providing a webpage to a user of the device or to other non device entities. For example use statistics use statistics relative to use of other devices use patterns and or statistics summarizing sensor readings can be generated by the processing engine and transmitted. The results or statistics can be provided via the Internet . In this manner the processing engine can be configured and programmed to derive a variety of useful information from the home data . A single server can include one or more engines.

The derived data can be highly beneficial at a variety of different granularities for a variety of useful purposes ranging from explicit programmed control of the devices on a per home per neighborhood or per region basis for example demand response programs for electrical utilities to the generation of inferential abstractions that can assist on a per home basis for example an inference can be drawn that the homeowner has left for vacation and so security detection equipment can be put on heightened sensitivity to the generation of statistics and associated inferential abstractions that can be used for government or charitable purposes. For example processing engine can generate statistics about device usage across a population of devices and send the statistics to device users service providers or other entities e.g. that have requested or may have provided monetary compensation for the statistics .

According to some embodiments the home data the derived home data and or another data can be used to create automated neighborhood safety networks. For example in the event the central server or cloud computing architecture receives data indicating that a particular home has been broken into is experiencing a fire or some other type of emergency event an alarm is sent to other smart homes in the neighborhood. In some instances the central server or cloud computing architecture automatically identifies smart homes within a radius of the home experiencing the emergency and sends an alarm to the identified homes. In such instances the other homes in the neighborhood do not have to sign up for or register to be a part of a safety network but instead are notified of an emergency based on their proximity to the location of the emergency. This creates robust and evolving neighborhood security watch networks such that if one person s home is getting broken into an alarm can be sent to nearby homes such as by audio announcements via the smart devices located in those homes. It should be appreciated that this can be an opt in service and that in addition to or instead of the central server or cloud computing architecture selecting which homes to send alerts to individuals can subscribe to participate in such networks and individuals can specify which homes they want to receive alerts from. This can include for example the homes of family members who live in different cities such that individuals can receive alerts when their loved ones in other locations are experiencing an emergency.

According to some embodiments sound vibration and or motion sensing components of the smart devices are used to detect sound vibration and or motion created by running water. Based on the detected sound vibration and or motion the central server or cloud computing architecture makes inferences about water usage in the home and provides related services. For example the central server or cloud computing architecture can run programs algorithms that recognize what water sounds like and when it is running in the home. According to one embodiment to map the various water sources of the home upon detecting running water the central server or cloud computing architecture sends a message an occupant s mobile device asking if water is currently running or if water has been recently run in the home and if so which room and which water consumption appliance e.g. sink shower toilet etc. was the source of the water. This enables the central server or cloud computing architecture to determine the signature or fingerprint of each water source in the home. This is sometimes referred to herein as audio fingerprinting water usage. 

In one illustrative example the central server or cloud computing architecture creates a signature for the toilet in the master bathroom and whenever that toilet is flushed the central server or cloud computing architecture will know that the water usage at that time is associated with that toilet. Thus the central server or cloud computing architecture can track the water usage of that toilet as well as each water consumption application in the home. This information can be correlated to water bills or smart water meters so as to provide users with a breakdown of their water usage.

According to some embodiments sound vibration and or motion sensing components of the smart devices are used to detect sound vibration and or motion created by mice and other rodents as well as by termites cockroaches and other insects collectively referred to as pests . Based on the detected sound vibration and or motion the central server or cloud computing architecture makes inferences about pest detection in the home and provides related services. For example the central server or cloud computing architecture can run programs algorithms that recognize what certain pests sound like how they move and or the vibration they create individually and or collectively. According to one embodiment the central server or cloud computing architecture can determine the signatures of particular types of pests.

For example in the event the central server or cloud computing architecture detects sounds that may be associated with pests it notifies the occupants of such sounds and suggests hiring a pest control company. If it is confirmed that pests are indeed present the occupants input to the central server or cloud computing architecture confirms that its detection was correct along with details regarding the identified pests such as name type description location quantity etc. This enables the central server or cloud computing architecture to tune itself for better detection and create signatures or fingerprints for specific types of pests. For example the central server or cloud computing architecture can use the tuning as well as the signatures and fingerprints to detect pests in other homes such as nearby homes that may be experiencing problems with the same pests. Further for example in the event that two or more homes in a neighborhood are experiencing problems with the same or similar types of pests the central server or cloud computing architecture can make inferences that nearby homes may also have such problems or may be susceptible to having such problems and it can send warning messages to those homes to help facilitate early detection and prevention.

In some embodiments to encourage innovation and research and to increase products and services available to users the devices and services platform expose a range of application programming interfaces APIs to third parties such as charities governmental entities e.g. the Food and Drug Administration or the Environmental Protection Agency academic institutions e.g. university researchers businesses e.g. providing device warranties or service to related equipment targeting advertisements based on home data utility companies and other third parties. The APIs are coupled to and permit third party systems to communicate with the central server or the cloud computing system including the services the processing engine the home data and the derived home data . For example the APIs allow applications executed by the third parties to initiate specific data processing tasks that are executed by the central server or the cloud computing system as well as to receive dynamic updates to the home data and the derived home data .

For example third parties can develop programs and or applications such as web or mobile apps that integrate with the central server or the cloud computing system to provide services and information to users. Such programs and application may be for example designed to help users reduce energy consumption to preemptively service faulty equipment to prepare for high service demands to track past service performance etc. or to perform any of a variety of beneficial functions or tasks now known or hereinafter developed.

According to some embodiments third party applications make inferences from the home data and the derived home data such inferences may include when are occupants home when are they sleeping when are they cooking when are they in the den watching television and when do they shower. The answers to these questions may help third parties benefit consumers by providing them with interesting information products and services as well as with providing them with targeted advertisements.

In one example a shipping company creates an application that makes inferences regarding when people are at home. The application uses the inferences to schedule deliveries for times when people will most likely be at home. The application can also build delivery routes around these scheduled times. This reduces the number of instances where the shipping company has to make multiple attempts to deliver packages and it reduces the number of times consumers have to pick up their packages from the shipping company.

For example shows processing engine as including a number of paradigms . Processing engine can include a managed services paradigm that monitors and manages primary or secondary device functions. The device functions can include ensuring proper operation of a device given user inputs estimating that e.g. and responding to an instance in which an intruder is or is attempting to be in a dwelling detecting a failure of equipment coupled to the device e.g. a light bulb having burned out implementing or otherwise responding to energy demand response events or alerting a user of a current or predicted future event or characteristic. Processing engine can further include an advertising communication paradigm that estimates characteristics e.g. demographic information desires and or products of interest of a user based on device usage. Services promotions products or upgrades can then be offered or automatically provided to the user. Processing engine can further include a social paradigm that uses information from a social network provides information to a social network for example based on device usage and or processes data associated with user and or device interactions with the social network platform. For example a user s status as reported to their trusted contacts on the social network could be updated to indicate when they are home based on light detection security system inactivation or device usage detectors. As another example a user may be able to share device usage statistics with other users. In yet another example a user may share HVAC settings that result in low power bills and other users may download the HVAC settings to their smart thermostat to reduce their power bills.

The processing engine can include a challenges rules compliance rewards paradigm that informs a user of challenges competitions rules compliance regulations and or rewards and or that uses operation data to determine whether a challenge has been met a rule or regulation has been complied with and or a reward has been earned. The challenges rules or regulations can relate to efforts to conserve energy to live safely e.g. reducing exposure to toxins or carcinogens to conserve money and or equipment life to improve health etc. For example one challenge may involve participants turning down their thermostat by one degree for one week. Those that successfully complete the challenge are rewarded such as by coupons virtual currency status etc. Regarding compliance an example involves a rental property owner making a rule that no renters are permitted to access certain owner s rooms. The devices in the room having occupancy sensors could send updates to the owner when the room is accessed.

The processing engine can integrate or otherwise utilize extrinsic information from extrinsic sources to improve the functioning of one or more processing paradigms. Extrinsic information can be used to interpret data received from a device to determine a characteristic of the environment near the device e.g. outside a structure that the device is enclosed in to determine services or products available to the user to identify a social network or social network information to determine contact information of entities e.g. public service entities such as an emergency response team the police or a hospital near the device etc. to identify statistical or environmental conditions trends or other information associated with a home or neighborhood and so forth.

An extraordinary range and variety of benefits can be brought about by and fit within the scope of the described extensible devices and services platform ranging from the ordinary to the profound. Thus in one ordinary example each bedroom of the smart home environment can be provided with a smart wall switch a smart wall plug and or smart hazard detectors all or some of which include an occupancy sensor wherein the occupancy sensor is also capable of inferring e.g. by virtue of motion detection facial recognition audible sound patterns etc. whether the occupant is asleep or awake. If a serious fire event is sensed the remote security monitoring service or fire department is advised of how many occupants there are in each bedroom and whether those occupants are still asleep or immobile or whether they have properly evacuated the bedroom. While this is of course a very advantageous capability accommodated by the described extensible devices and services platform there can be substantially more profound examples that can truly illustrate the potential of a larger intelligence that can be made available. By way of perhaps a more profound example the same bedroom occupancy data that is being used for fire safety can also be repurposed by the processing engine in the context of a social paradigm of neighborhood child development and education. Thus for example the same bedroom occupancy and motion data discussed in the ordinary example can be collected and made available properly anonymized for processing in which the sleep patterns of schoolchildren in a particular ZIP code can be identified and tracked. Localized variations in the sleeping patterns of the schoolchildren may be identified and correlated for example to different nutrition programs in local schools.

In this portion of the disclosure an intelligent thermostat system for boiler based heating systems will be presented. As used herein the term intelligent thermostat system may refer to an environmental control system that is configured to measure and regulate a temperature within an enclosure by controlling one or more operations associated with a boiler based heating system. In some embodiments an intelligent thermostat system may include multiple components or devices that are distributed throughout an enclosure. For example an intelligent thermostat system may include a head unit a backplate the base unit and or a reflective stand. Each of these components or combination of components may be distributed in different locations throughout the enclosure and may communicate using wired and or wireless communication techniques.

Heated water or water vapor from the boiler may be circulated throughout the enclosure into one or more radiators . In some homes each room may be equipped with its own radiator to provide localized heat. In other homes radiators may be strategically placed throughout the enclosure to optimally heat the surrounding environment. Each radiator may operate as a heat exchanger used to transfer thermal energy from the heated water provided from the boiler into the air within the enclosure . Single type radiators are usually configured to work with either heated steam or water vapor while double type radiators are usually configured to work with both heated steam and heated water. Pump systems not shown may be co located with the boiler in order to continuously pump water through the radiators during times when the boiler is instructed to provide heat to the enclosure . Water can be pumped from the boiler to the radiator through a hot water line . As heat is exchanged between the radiator and the environment of the enclosure the water exiting the radiator may have cooled substantially. The cooled water can exit the radiator and return to the boiler through a cold water return line .

Each of the radiators may be provided with a means for exercising local control over the amount of heat provided by the radiator . Some radiators may include a control valve on the radiator that is configured to regulate the flow of heated water through the radiator . As the valve is opened the heated water flow through radiator will increase thereby causing the radiator to heat the room more effectively. Conversely as the valve is closed the heated water flow through the radiator will decrease thereby causing the radiator to heat the room less effectively. It may be useful to consider the control valve as analogous to local vent controls on a forced air system that would be found in the United States. Just as vent controls allow users to regulate the flow of heated air into a particular room in a forced air system each control valve allows users to regulate the heat of the radiator . In some cases the control valve may comprise a thermostatic radiator control valve TRV that automatically regulates the pressure in the radiator according to a desired temperature that is mechanically specified using a dial or knob on the control valve . The TRV could also have electromechanical control which in various embodiments may facilitate advanced features such as scheduling or remote control to be controlled by an intelligent thermostat system. The TRV can then detect the local air temperature and regulate the flow of hot water steam through the radiator depending on the temperature of the room.

In addition to the local temperature control provided by a control valve additional controls may be located throughout the enclosure including at or near the boiler . The simplest boiler control is an on off switch for the boiler . Turning on the boiler on off switch can activate a heating function and begin heating water steam. For example the boiler can ignite a gas based burner to begin heating water within its reservoir. In other boilers turning on the boiler on off switch can place the boiler in a standby mode to await a command from a programmer . Some boilers also include separate temperature controls for controlling the temperature of the water steam. This allows the user to control the temperature of the water steam as it leaves the boiler to supply heat to the enclosure . Generally the temperature controls for the boiler will be set hotter in the winter and cooler in the summer.

In order to conserve energy the programmer may act as a gateway device that automatically controls the times during which the boiler will actively heat water steam. In some embodiments a homeowner may wish to automatically turn off the boiler during the day when the enclosure is unoccupied. The homeowner may also desire to automatically activate the boiler during times when the enclosure is expected to be occupied. For example the programmer may comprise a timer that automatically turns the boiler off between the hours of 9 00 AM and 4 00 PM. Thus when a homeowner returns from work at approximately 5 00 PM the boiler will be on and ready to supply heated water steam to the enclosure . The programmer may be as simple as mechanical timer or complex enough to set heating schedules for individual days.

The boiler shown in may provide both heated water steam to the enclosure for heating the environment as well as providing a reservoir of heated water for direct use such as showering washing dishes providing bathwater and or the like. This direct use may be referred to demand hot water or DHW. A boiler that acts as both an environmental heater and a water heater may be referred to as a combination boiler or combi boiler. When a combination boiler is installed the programmer may be configured to regulate one or both of the environmental heating function and or the water heating function. A combi boiler may use a single channel programmer that provides outputs to control both calls for heat and DHW commands with the same function.

In some cases the programmer may provide the primary means by which a user may regulate the temperature within the enclosure . For example the user may set the programmer to activate the boiler for a few hours in order to keep the enclosure warm. In some embodiments this may be done at regularly scheduled intervals according to a schedule programmed manually for the enclosure . However this method of controlling the operation of the boiler is very coarse at best and is not generally a reliable method of environmental temperature control particularly as seasons change and outdoor weather effects affect the enclosure differently throughout the year.

In order to provide more fine grained control for heating the enclosure one or more thermostats may be provided that are communicatively coupled to the programmer and or the boiler . In the configuration illustrated by thermostat is coupled to the programmer via a wired connection . Thermostat may receive power from the programmer . The thermostat may be comprised of a bimetallic coil strip that can be adjusted according to a desired temperature. Power can be provided to both the boiler and or the programmer through a mains AC power source. The mains AC power source may comprise any suitable power output. For example in England the mains AC power source may comprise a 220 VAC power outlet. Typically the 220 VAC signal may be propagated through one line of the wired connection and returned to the other line of the wire connection when the thermostat calls for a heating function. Therefore the thermostat acts as a switch that determines when heated water steam should be circulated through the radiators . It should be noted that many different wiring configurations are possible due to the number of different makes models and or installation scenarios for boiler based heating systems. Although not shown explicitly in the boiler may receive AC power from the mains AC power source through the programmer . Thus the programmer may operate as a power switch for the boiler determining when power should be connected in order to actively heat the water steam. As known in the art the mains AC power supplied to the boiler most often does not constitute the actual fuel source for the heating process itself which is usually natural gas oil or other high energy density fuel source but rather this mains AC power is used for powering the electrical electronic components of the boiler and furthermore serving as a signaling means for instantiating the heating function. In other configurations the mains AC power source may be connected independently to the boiler and or the programmer . The programmer may act as a gatekeeper between the thermostat and the boiler . Thus the programmer may control when the boiler is allowed to accept and respond to a call for heat command from the thermostat .

The thermostat may be connected directly to the programmer as illustrated in . Alternatively the thermostat may be connected to one or more zone valves not shown in which are then in turn coupled through the programmer to the boiler . Zone valves can be used to independently control different radiators such as radiator throughout the enclosure . Valves may include switches motors conduits and or the like that can be opened and closed to allow heated water steam to flow therethrough and when at the end of the opening process cause a mains line voltage received from the thermostat to be passed through to the boiler to instantiate the heating process. Different models of the programmer may be configured to control multiple valves using multiple thermostat inputs. The thermostat may be routed through the programmer or may be connected directly to one or more of the valve controls. In other cases the thermostat may also be connected directly to the boiler . The various wiring configurations will vary depending on the particular system and or installation.

In some configurations each zone may be equipped with its own thermostat . Typically a thermostat will be hardwired to the programmer using wires that are hidden within the walls of the enclosure and or within conduit attached to the walls. By providing a thermostat with power from the mains AC power source the thermostat can both be powered by and communicate through the wired connection . Although not as common some boiler based heating systems may also utilize wireless communications between a thermostat and the programmer . A thermostat communicating with the programmer via a wireless connection is not connected to the programmer via a wired connection. Therefore the thermostat must receive power from an alternative power source such as a local power outlet or primary cell batteries. A detailed description of an enclosure with multiple zones and corresponding zone valves will be provided below in relation to . The boiler based heating system in can be interpreted to represent a boiler system without zone valves that has only a single output or to represent a boiler system with one or more internally integrated zone valves.

While the simple system described in may be adequate for modestly sized enclosures with low comfort expectations many consumers are beginning to demand more intelligent environmental control systems. Concern for the environment is prompting many home and building owners to demand a more finely tuned control system for regulating when the boiler actively heats water steam and when the heated water steam is circulated throughout the enclosure . Additionally many European countries have much higher utility rates than those in the United States. Therefore many home and building owners may be motivated for monetary reasons to more efficiently control the temperature within and thus the energy consumption of the enclosure .

One problem with the embodiment illustrated in is the bifurcation of the boiler control functions between the programmer and the thermostat . In order to adjust the boiler schedule the user needs to adjust the schedule on the programmer . Because the programmer is usually co located with the boiler the user is less likely to adjust the programmer when their daily schedule changes which can lead to wasted energy if the programmer enables the heat maintenance function of the thermostat boiler while the dwelling is unoccupied. Additionally wire connections are often required for many legacy thermostats and involve high voltage transmissions. As illustrated by the wired connection between the thermostat and the programmer carries a 220 VAC signal. Therefore the embodiments described herein implement an intelligent thermostat system in order to overcome these and many other problems with existing systems.

Generally the base unit may be co located with the boiler and may be used to interface directly with the boiler controls. In contrast the intelligent thermostat may be configured to perform advanced scheduling algorithms time to temperature algorithms environmental control algorithms sunlight compensation algorithms occupancy detection algorithms and or the like. The intelligent thermostat may also be configured to communicate with the smart home system described herein comprising hazard detectors and other devices within a smart home environment. The intelligent thermostat may also be configured to perform the functions of the programmer in controlling when the boiler is actively heating water steam.

In the configuration of a programmer is still present. Occasionally the programmer may be built into the boiler such that its removal is not practical. In other cases where a combi boiler is not used the programmer may still be needed to control a hot water heating function for showers laundry and or the like. In configurations such as this where the programmer is still connected to the boiler the base unit may communicate with the programmer and or directly with the boiler not shown . Similarly the mains AC power supply may be connected to any combination of the programmer the base unit and or the boiler in series or in parallel depending on the particular installation. In order to operate with the base unit the programmer may be set such that the programmer is always on. In one embodiment an installation manual included with the intelligent thermostat system may include a sticker provided for the user to place on the programmer . The sticker may include instructions notifications or warnings that indicate to the user that the programmer should be left on such that the intelligent thermostat system may operate as intended. In some embodiments the base unit could have separate control channels for heating and hot water thus comprising all functionality of the previous programmer and allowing a configuration as shown in . In other words some embodiments of the base unit can also replace the hot water function of the programmer for use with combi boilers.

Generally when an intelligent thermostat system includes a base unit as described herein the programmer can be bypassed or otherwise neutralized with respect to the central heating CH function. The programmer can either be disconnected and removed from the boiler based heating system or wiring connections can be made such that the programmer simply passes signals through from the base unit to the boiler . For example many modern combi boilers include an integrated programmer that cannot be simply removed from the system. In these embodiments the programmer can be wired or configured such that the programmer is always in an on state. This can include shorting actual wired connections and or manipulating settings on the programmer .

In cases where the programmer does not control a hot water heater for laundry bathing some embodiments will remove the programmer during installation of the intelligent thermostat system. In this case the base unit can communicate directly with the boiler and in some cases can regulate the flow of power from the mains AC power source to the boiler . The base unit can be configured with one or more switches such as relays triacs and or power FETs to switch the 220 VAC signals required to control the boiler . The base unit can also be configured to convert and regulate the 220 VAC signals for use in other parts of the system e.g. it may be configured to convert the signals into lower voltage DC signals that can be used to power the intelligent thermostat . Therefore user interactions may mainly involve the intelligent thermostat . In contrast the base unit can operate largely independent of user interactions by receiving instructions from the intelligent thermostat . Thus the user can control the operation of the boiler without having to adjust the programmer if the programmer is still connected. The programmer functions can instead be implemented using the intelligent thermostat .

As illustrated in thermostat is communicatively coupled to zone valve . When thermostat determines that a call for heat is required a signal can be sent to zone valve that causes zone valve to open and allow heated water steam to flow through radiator . It will be understood that the same process can be followed for other zones. For example thermostat can cause zone valve to open and thereby allow heated steam water to flow through radiator . Although only two zones are shown in other embodiments may have more or fewer zones without restriction within the enclosure .

As described above combi boiler systems combine the provisioning of demand hot water DHW destined for domestic use and the provisioning of call for heat CH hot water destined for radiators into the same physical boiler system. By way of contrast the embodiment of illustrates a separate domestic water reservoir often termed a cylinder that stores water for DHW purposes. For example the cylinder can supply water for dishwashers water faucets washing machines and or the like. In embodiments such as these a dual channel programmer may be used to separately control the boiler in conjunction with the cylinder for DHW commands and the boiler in conjunction with the zone valves for CH commands.

In this embodiment the zone valves are shown as being separate for the cylinder and each of the zones. However in some embodiments one or more of the zone valve may be combined into a single multifunction unit. For example a mid position valve not shown can be used that will provide multiple flow configurations. One midposition valve can allow heated steam water to flow to 1 a radiator in a particular zone 2 to the cylinder or 3 to both the particular radiator and the cylinder simultaneously.

The wiring illustrated in will be understood to be simplified for illustrative purposes. In actual systems many different wiring configurations are possible. For example one embodiment may accept a mains line power supply 220 VAC from the enclosure through the dual channel programmer . The power signal can be routed from the dual channel programmer to the zone valves . The zone valves can then provide power to the thermostats and the thermostats can provide a signal that controls the open closed setting of the valves . When the thermostats send a signal that causes the valves to open power can then be connected through the valves to the boiler by way of the dual channel programmer . Providing power to the boiler may also power one or more pumps not shown that force heated steam water to circulate through the boiler based heating system via the hot water line and returning through the cold water return . This configuration allows the dual channel programmer to regulate when the thermostats are allowed to actuate the zone valves and provide power to the boiler . When the dual channel programmer is off the thermostats may be unable to activate the zone valves or the boiler .

It should also be noted that many boiler based heating systems use a junction box into which all of the wiring connections illustrated by can be routed. During installation a technician can then make connections between the thermostats the dual channel programmer the zone valves and or the boiler all in a single location. For illustrative purposes the junction box is not shown explicitly in in order to clearly show the locations of various system elements and the communication therebetween. It should also be understood that the locations of system elements such as the thermostats the radiators the zone valves the dual channel programmer and or the boiler may be relocated throughout the enclosure depending on various factors. For example the zone valves may be co located with the boiler or they may be distributed throughout the enclosure such as in the floor in a closet and or the like.

Another advantage gained by a modular intelligent thermostat system involves ease of installation. During installation and after removal of the old thermostat two wires will generally be exposed protruding from the wall of the enclosure. These wires can be inserted into the wire connections of the backplate through the center hole. The backplate can then be screwed to the wall and the head unit can then be secured to the backplate . The base unit can be installed in close proximity to the boiler and attached to an existing wired connection and or wirelessly paired with the head unit .

This modular design also allows the high power 220 VAC signals from the mains AC power source to be isolated near the boiler . This eliminates the need for high voltages to run through wires within the home thus eliminating a possible fire hazard. Additionally the lower voltage sent to the wire connection by the base unit will pose less of a danger to the installer of the thermostat comprising the backplate and the head unit . The base unit can take the 220 VAC power supply and regulate reduce it to a safer DC level such as 12 VDC. This allows the head unit and the backplate to operate at lower DC voltages while the base unit can interact with the boiler at higher AC voltages.

In order to understand the operation in the interaction between each of the three modules of the intelligent thermostat system the head unit the backplate and the base unit each of these modules will be discussed individually below. A description of the intelligent thermostat comprised of the head unit and the backplate will be described first followed by individual descriptions of the head unit the backplate and then the base unit .

By rotation of the outer ring or ring rotation and inward pushing of the outer ring or inward click the intelligent thermostat can receive some or all of the necessary information from the user for basic setup and operation. The outer ring is mechanically mounted in a manner that provides a smooth yet viscous feel to the user for further promoting an overall feeling of elegance while also reducing spurious or unwanted rotational inputs. To summarize the intelligent thermostat may be operable to recognize a variety of user inputs such as 1 ring rotate left 2 ring rotate right and 3 inward click. In other implementations more complex fundamental user inputs can be recognized such as double click or triple click inward presses along with speed sensitive or acceleration sensitive rotational inputs.

Although being formed from a single lens like piece of material such as polycarbonate the cover has two different regions or portions including an outer portion that is painted or smoked and a central portion that is visibly clear so as to facilitate viewing of an electronic display disposed thereunder. According to one embodiment in which the diameter of the intelligent thermostat is about 80 mm the diameter of the electronic display is about 45 mm. A second downwardly tilted PIR sensor is provided to detect an approaching user i.e. a person who is close enough that they may be intending to physically interact with the intelligent thermostat and or may be intending to read the electronic display . The proximity sensor can be used to detect proximity in the range of about one meter so that the intelligent thermostat can initiate waking up when the user is approaching the thermostat. Such use of proximity sensing is useful for enhancing the user experience by being ready for interaction or viewing as soon as or very soon after the user is ready to interact with or view the thermostat. Further the wake on proximity functionality also allows for energy savings within the thermostat by allowing the electronic display and certain of its internal components to sleep when no user interaction or viewing is taking place or about to take place.

The intelligent thermostat further includes a processing system not shown in a display driver not shown in and a wireless communication system not shown in . The processing system is configured and programmed to carry out the governance of the operation of intelligent thermostat including various user interface features. The processing system is further programmed and configured to carry out other operations as described further herein and or in other ones of the commonly assigned incorporated applications such as but not limited to automated self programming of an HVAC schedule based on user temperature setting inputs and other factors automated and optimally timed determination based on historical occupancy statistics that the house is likely unoccupied and corresponding automated temperature setback to reduce energy use during those times automated prediction of an estimated time to reach a target temperature and corresponding displayed advisory on the user interface automated data logging and uploading of data logs to a central cloud based server automated and optimized control of particular HVAC equipment based on current and historical operating statistics and current and forecasted outside weather automated gradual schedule migration with informed user consent to lower energy settings over selected periods of time such that users are less likely to feel uncomfortable at the lower energy temperature setpoints automated generation and continuous updating of a home thermal model and HVAC characteristics for improved HVAC control automated and optimized cooperation with informed user consent with utility demand response event notifications by computation and continual updating of optimal temperature setpoint trajectories to maximize selected metrics of energy time shifting while also minimizing selected metrics of user discomfort and a variety of other useful and energy saving comfort producing functionalities. In furtherance of these objectives the wireless communications system is used to communicate with devices such as home wireless routers other thermostats or HVAC system components or other smart home devices with such communications being for example peer to peer communications communications through one or more servers located on a private network and or communications through a cloud based service.

Battery assembly includes a rechargeable Lithium Ion battery which for one preferred embodiment has a nominal voltage of 3.7 volts and a nominal capacity of 560 mAh. To extend battery life however the battery is normally not charged beyond 450 mAh by the thermostat battery charging circuitry. Moreover although the battery is rated to be capable of being charged to 4.2 volts the thermostat battery charging circuitry normally does not charge it beyond 3.95 volts. Battery assembly also includes connecting wires and a battery mounting film that is attached to battery using a strong adhesive and to the rear shielding can of head unit PCB using a relatively weaker adhesive. By using a weaker adhesive to mount the film of battery assembly to shielding can of the PCB subsequent replacement of battery assembly including battery is facilitated. According to some embodiments the battery assembly is user replaceable.

Also visible in is Fresnel lens that operates in conjunction with the two PIR motion sensors and see supra that are mounted on a PIR mini board which in turn attaches to the back side i.e. the wall facing side of PCB .

In addition to physical divisions within the thermostat that simplify the installation process the thermostat may also be divided functionally between the head unit and the backplate. illustrates a simplified functional block diagram for a head unit according to one embodiment. The functions embodied by block diagram are largely self explanatory and may be implemented using one or more processing functions. As used herein the term processing function may refer to any combination of hardware and or software. For example a processing function may include a microprocessor a microcontroller distributed processors a lookup table digital logic logical arithmetic functions implemented in analog circuitry and or the like. A processing function may also be referred to as a processing system a processing circuit or simply a circuit.

In this embodiment a processing function on the head unit may be implemented by an ARM processor. The head unit processing function may interface with the electronic display an audio system and a manipulation sensor as a part of a user interface . The head unit processing function may also facilitate wireless communications by interfacing with various wireless modules such as a Wi Fi module and or a ZigBee style module . Furthermore the head unit processing function may be configured to control the core thermostat operations such as operating the HVAC system. The head unit processing function may further be configured to determine or sense occupancy of a physical location and to determine building characteristics that can be used to determine time to temperature characteristics. Using the occupancy sensing the processing function on the head unit may also be configured to learn and manage operational schedules such as diurnal heat and cooling schedules. A power management module may be used to interface with a corresponding power management module on the backplate and or base unit the rechargeable battery and a power control circuit .

Additionally the head unit processing function may include and or be communicatively coupled to one or more memories. The one or more memories may include one or more sets of instructions that cause the processing function to operate as described above. The one or more memories may also include a sensor history and global state objects . The one or more memories may be integrated with the processing function such as a flash memory or RAM memory available on many commercial microprocessors. The head unit processing function may also include a cloud management interface configured to interface with a cloud management system and may also operate to conserve energy and or facilitate gaming wherever appropriate. An interface to a backplate processing function may also be included and may be implemented using a hardware connector.

One particularly advantageous feature of the head unit is its ability to operate with different types of backplates. For example the head unit described above can be coupled with a backplate that is configured to accept wire connections from a forced air HVAC system. The head unit can be coupled to a backplate that accepts connections from an HVAC system comprising an air conditioner a humidifier a forced air heating system a radiant flooring system and or the like. This particular backplate may also be configured to harvest power from an HVAC system by stealing power from an HVAC call relay wire. Additionally or alternatively the backplate may be configured to operate using a common C wire from the HVAC system.

In the intelligent thermostat system for boiler based systems the head unit can be coupled to a backplate that is simpler than the backplate described above for forced air HVAC systems. illustrate front and rear perspective views of a backplate of an intelligent thermostat according to some embodiments. only illustrate the external form factor and features of the backplate the internal circuitry and functional operational are described below. To provide for easy installation the backplate may include wire insertion points configured to receive a two wire connection from the base unit. In this embodiment screws may be used to secure wires into the insertion points after they are inserted. Screws may be advantageous because the wires inserted into the insertion points will typically be from an old installation. Therefore these wires will generally be large gauge wires that were suitable for carrying 220 VAC. In other embodiments mechanical insertion devices may include a finger pressable tab that allows wire to be inserted when pressed and secures the wire therein when released. During installation the user can slide the exposed wires through the opening in the center of the backplate insert the wires into the insertion points and secure the wires using the screws . A groove is formed in the back of the backplate and configured to allow the wires to run through the groove from the insertion points and out the bottom side of the backplate such that the backplate can be mounted flush to a wall.

After installation of the wires connecting the backplate to the base unit the backplate can be mounted to for example a wall of the enclosure. The backplate can be mounted through screw holes on the sides of the backplate . The opening for the screw holes on the front side of the backplate may be large enough to accommodate a mounting screw head. In contrast the opening for the screw holes in the backside of the backplate may be tapered or shelved to catch the mounting screw head. Additionally the screw holes may be vertically oversized or oval shaped such that once the screws are inserted into the screw holes and partially screwed into the wall the backplate can still be rotated around a center axis in order to ensure a level installation. A bubble level is built into the backplate such that a user can visually determine when the backplate is correctly mounted to the wall.

In some installations the backplate will not be connected to a base unit via a wired connection. Therefore the base unit cannot provide power to the backplate through the insertion points . In order to receive power the backplate can include a USB port that can accept a micro USB connector that provides power to the backplate and head unit. The micro USB connector can be wired to a USB power converter brick that is well known in the art which can in turn be inserted into a traditional AC outlet. As with the two wire installation the wire for the USB connector can be routed through the groove in the backside of the backplate .

Once the backplate is mounted to the wall the head unit can be connected to the backplate. Connecting the backplate to the head unit can include connecting a connector on the head unit shown in to a connector on the backplate . The connector can communicate between microprocessors on the backplate and microprocessors in the head unit as well as provide power from the backplate to the head unit to operate circuitry or charge the rechargeable battery. Connecting the backplate to the head unit can also include a physical connection using recesses in the backplate to accept corresponding tabs in the head unit. The tab connection can provide an additional mechanical resistance to separating the head unit from the backplate .

To maximize the amount of time for which the relatively high powered head unit processor can remain in a low power sleep state the relatively low powered backplate processor microcontroller may control and poll not only the sensors contained in the backplate but also control and poll most of the sensors contained in the head unit. For one embodiment in addition to controlling and polling a temperature humidity sensor chip contained on the backplate circuit board the backplate processor microcontroller can also control and poll any or all sensors contained in the head unit with the possible exception of the optical finger navigation OFN module in some embodiments. As such the backplate processor microcontroller controls and polls the following components of the head unit the first temperature sensor the second temperature sensor the ambient light sensor ALS the forward facing occupancy detecting PIR detector and the diagonally downward facing proximity detecting PIR detector. Electrical connectivity between the backplate processor microcontroller and the subject head unit sensors is achieved using a 20 pin connector along with one or more port expanders on the head unit circuit board by which the electrical connections are established when the head unit is mated to the backplate. Backplate circuit board may further comprise a timing crystal chip that may provide for example a 32.768 kHz signal that may be used by the backplate processor microcontroller for timing reference purposes. In other embodiments an internal oscillator in the backplate processor microcontroller may be used instead of the timing crystal chip . The backplate processor microcontroller performs in addition to the controlling and polling of the various sensors sensing for mechanical wire insertion at installation alerting the head unit regarding current vs. setpoint temperature conditions and other functions such as looking for appropriate signals on the inserted HVAC wires at installation and thereafter.

Backplate circuit board further comprises the combined temperature humidity sensor chip positioned near a lower periphery thereof. The temperature humidity sensor chip can comprise by way of example and not by way of limitation a Sensirion SHT20 module. Thermal isolation of the temperature humidity sensor chip from the rest of the backplate circuit board is facilitated by virtue of a through hole . Further disposed on the backplate circuit board in an arcuate arrangement neararound a peripheral portion of the center cutout wire connectors that may include integrated mechanical wire insertion sensing capability in some embodiments.

In backplate circuit boards used to directly control the HVAC functions in intelligent thermostats used in countries such as the United States encapsulated transformer diode circuits can be used for transformer based isolation of the control and logic circuitry from the HVAC connection and switching circuitry. Disposed on the back side of the backplate circuit board not shown are field effect transistor FET switches not shown that perform the HVAC switching functionality and that are electrically disposed on the isolated HVAC connection and switching circuitry side of the transformer diode circuits not shown . The FET switches perform inter alia the basic closing and opening between the requisite HVAC terminals according to the desired HVAC function. One or more of the FET switches not shown are also judiciously configured and controlled to facilitate power stealing during active HVAC cycles for circumstances in which there is no C wire available to power the thermostat. The use of FETs in the switching circuitry allows for active power stealing i.e. taking power during the HVAC ON cycle by briefly diverting power from the HVAC relay circuit to the reservoir capacitors for a very small interval such as 100 micro seconds. This time is small enough not to trip the HVAC relay into the OFF state but is sufficient to charge up the reservoir capacitors. The use of FETs allows for this fast switching time 100 micro seconds which would be difficult to achieve using relays which stay on for tens of milliseconds . Also such relays would readily degrade with fast switching and they would also make audible noise. In contrast the FETs operate with essentially no audible noise.

In the backplate circuit board illustrated in the HVAC switching circuitry and power stealing circuitry described in the previous paragraph can be omitted. Because power is provided directly to both power the thermostat and charge the rechargeable battery no power stealing circuitry is required. If power is provided from an external source such as the base unit describe below or the micro USB connector the power will be in the form of a constant DC voltage. Additionally the backplate circuit board is configured to operate with a base unit and the HVAC interaction and switching circuitry described above can be moved from the backplate circuit board to the base unit as will be described below.

Power can be received from a micro USB connector such as the molex micro USB B receptacle with mid mount and through hole solder tab Molex 47642 1001 . Additionally or alternatively DC power can be received from the base unit through the wire connectors .

Backplate circuit board further comprises various other DC power regulation circuitry for providing power that is used by the backplate processor microcontroller the environmental sensors controlled thereby the various other backplate circuit board components and for providing a DC power rail voltage e.g. 4.4 VDC that is input to the battery charging circuitry of the head unit. Such DC power generation circuitry includes for example bootstrap and primary LDO circuitry.

Bridge rectifier circuitry may include for example a 0.5 A SBR bridge super barrier rectifier Diodes Inc. part no. SBR05M100BLP such that the user need not be concerned with matching wires between the wire connector at the base unit with the corresponding wire connectors on the backplate . A high voltage buck converter circuit may use for example a 3 17 V 0.5 A step down converter e.g. TPS62170 from Texas Instruments for generating a converted voltage output such as 4.704 V nominal output. A low dropout LDO regulator circuit mounted on the back side of the backplate circuit board not shown may utilize for example a Ricoh three mode 150 mA regulator with reverse current protection R1163x Series and or R1191x series to filter the output of the high voltage buck converter circuit and generate for example a 4.4 V output. A similar LDO regulator circuit may utilize similar components to generate a regulated power supply for the backplate processor microcontroller . The backplate circuit board may further comprise wired communications circuitry for communicating with the base unit described below a slew rate limiting circuit bootstrap and primary LDO circuitry a sensor power control circuit that allows the backplate processor microcontroller to power cycle all of the sensors a reset and boot loading circuit and a debug connection circuit to allow JTAG UART programming.

The backplate processor microcontroller may also include a sensor polling interface to interface with a plurality of sensors. In this particular embodiment the plurality of sensors may include temperature sensors a humidity sensor PIR sensors a proximity sensor an ambient light sensor and or other sensors not specifically listed. This list is not meant to be exhaustive. Other types of sensors may be used depending on the particular embodiment and application such as sound sensors flame sensors smoke detectors and or the like. The sensor polling interface may be communicatively coupled to a sensor reading memory . The sensor reading memory can store sensor readings and may be located internally or externally to a microcontroller or microprocessor.

Finally the backplate processing function can include a power management unit that is used to control various digital and or analog components integrated with the backplate and used to manage the power system of the thermostat. Although one having skill in the art will recognize many different implementations of a power management system the power management system of this particular embodiment can include the functions described above in relation to such as a bootstrap regulator a buck converter a battery controller and or various voltage regulation circuits.

Having described the connection between the head unit and the backplate the intelligent thermostat can be assembled and powered as described above. For convenience during installation and operation multiple installation configurations are possible depending upon the particular type of enclosure the preference of the homeowner and or the condition of existing thermostat circuitry within the enclosure. illustrate different installation configurations of an intelligent thermostat according to some embodiments.

Additionally or alternatively the intelligent thermostat may use a wireless connection to communicate with the base unit. In some embodiments the wired connection may be considered a primary connection while the wireless connection may be used as a backup connection. Various configurations are possible. In one embodiment both the wired connection and the wireless connection may operate in parallel transmitting the same information. In another embodiment the wired connection may be active during times when the wireless connection is unavailable for example due to interference low power situations or situations where the intelligent thermostat is out of wireless range for the radio. In another embodiment the wired connection may transmit signals that determine when the boiler should supply heated water steam to the area monitored by the intelligent thermostat while the wireless connection transmits more advanced diagnostic information such as user occupancy patterns collocated schedules and or the like for storage or analysis in the base unit. The base unit may also communicate information back to the thermostat such as wireless signal strength input power relay state temperature time since last successful RF communication number of onboard power cycles since last successful RF communication and or other diagnostic data.

In some embodiments the intelligent thermostat may include a first radio and a second radio. The first radio may be configured for high data rate communications such as those that take place with a local Wi Fi network. The second radio may be configured for relatively low data rate communications such as communications between the thermostat and the base unit. The second radio may be compatible with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard and may use a ZigBee protocol or a similar protocol. The second radio on the thermostat may be compatible with a third radio on the base unit that is also configured for relatively low data rate communications. While the second radio is communicating control signals for the boiler system to the third radio on the base unit the first radio may transmit auxiliary communications to a local Wi Fi network. For example the first radio may transmit sensor data occupancy data user commands and other such auxiliary information to a cloud based server or network.

Turning now to a detailed description of the base unit illustrate front and rear views of a base unit of an intelligent thermostat system according to some embodiments. The base unit may include a front cover that is designed to both protect the internal circuitry and provide for a sleek and elegant visual appearance that can blend in with its surroundings. The front cover hides the internal complexity of the base unit in order to provide users with a comforting interface that can inspire confidence and user friendliness as well as isolate the user from the high voltage wires beneath.

In some embodiments at least one external control may be accessible through the front cover . For example a button may be provided such that a user can easily provide a limited set of commands to the base unit without a programming interface. The button may be large such that is easily identifiable and may include a logo or trademark of a manufacturer such as Nest. The button may include a click mechanism such that the user can readily determine when depressing the button has registered a command to the internal circuits of the base unit .

The button may be used to provide a plurality of commands. In order to immediately call for heat regardless of the temperature schedule and or commands from the intelligent thermostat a user can depress the button . This can close internal relays of the base unit and activate the boiler system such that heated water steam is circulated throughout radiators in the enclosure. Similarly a second depression of the button can deactivate a call for heat regardless of whether the original heating command was provided from the button or from the intelligent thermostat. Additionally pressing button and holding it for a duration such as 3 seconds 5 seconds or 10 seconds may be used to reset the internal circuitry of the base unit in cases where the user believes a software malfunction has occurred. In some embodiments other input patterns with button may be used such as double clicks triple clicks etc. and button depressions lasting for varying time intervals. These additional input patterns may provide commands that cause the base unit to wirelessly pair with an intelligent thermostat commands the cause the base unit to call for heat for a specified period of time and or any other commands that would normally be provided from the intelligent thermostat.

The front cover can connect to a back cover of the base unit . The base unit can be mounted flush to the boiler to a wall near the boiler and or to any other surface in proximity to the boiler. Alternatively the base unit may be placed on a surface in proximity to the boiler. The base unit may be mounted through screw holes that are visible through the back of the back cover yet covered by the front cover . The front cover may be coupled to the rest of the base unit by way of tabs near the top of the front cover not shown and secured in place using a screw mechanism .

The button may be accessible through a recess in the body of the base unit . Next to the button a light pipe may direct light from an LED such that light emitted from the LED is visible through the front cover . The button may also be mechanically adjacent to a corresponding button on the base unit circuit board such that depressing the button actuates the button on the base unit circuit board . The base unit circuit board may include circuitry for switching and or connecting HVAC functions associated with the boiler system processor circuitry wireless and wired communications circuitry and wire insertion terminals . The base unit circuit board will be described in greater detail below. The base unit circuit board can be secured to the back cover through screw holes in the base unit circuit board and the body and button can be secured to the back cover . As described above the front cover can be secured to the body using a combination of the tabs at the top of the body and a screw mechanism not visible at the bottom of the body .

The base unit circuit board may also include a button that can interface with the button accessible through the front cover . For example the button may be a 4.2 mm 3.2 mm 2.5 mm tactile switch available from Alps SKRPABE010 . The base unit circuit board may also include a power regulation circuit that is configured to take the 220 VAC line power input and convert it to DC voltage levels. In this embodiment a flyback converter may be a suitable converter type for these power levels although other suitable converters may alternatively be used. As will be understood by one having skill in the art a flyback converter includes a first phase that charges up a storage element and a second phase that converts power from the storage element into a regulated DC voltage. Many different flyback converter designs are possible. One particular flyback converter design implemented in an embodiment uses a transformer T multiple inductors L L L etc. for filtering and emissions reduction multiple storage capacitors C C C C etc. and a high performance AC DC controller designed to drive an external power bipolar junction transistor BJT for peak mode flyback power supplies such as the iW1707 digital controller available from iWatt . Additionally the power regulation circuit may include DC conversion circuits and filtering circuits configured to provide the DC voltage for the wired connection to the intelligent thermostat through the wire connectors as well as power for the base unit microcontroller and radio. This may include a 4.4 V converter a 1.8 V buck converter e.g. TPS62170 available from Texas Instruments one or more single slew rate controlled load switches e.g. AP from Diodes Inc. a 6LoWPAN Pi Filter and a 6LoWPAN FEM load switch. The base unit circuit board may also include a USB connector e.g. Molex 105133 0031 . The USB connector can be used to program the base unit processor microcontroller and or base unit radio and power the associated circuitry during such programming.

The base unit processor microcontroller may be any available microcontroller or microprocessor. For example in this embodiment the base unit processor microcontroller uses a 32 bit microcontroller based on the ARM Cortex M4 core which includes high speed USB 2.0 flash memory and integrated ADC such as the Kinetis K60 family of microcontrollers from Freescale Semiconductor. The base unit processor microcontroller may be programmed through a JTAG UART debug ZIF connector. Additionally the base unit circuit board may include a radio in order to establish wireless communications with the radio in the head unit of the intelligent thermostat. For example the base unit circuit board may include a wireless integrated 802.15.4 compatible radio such as the EM357 chip available from Silicon Labs . The radio may operate in conjunction with a wireless front end module such as the SE2432L RF front end module by Skyworks . In order to isolate the digital noise from the base unit processor microcontroller and to isolate RF noise generated by the radio and front end module the base unit circuit board may include metal shielding around each of these components. The base unit may also include one or more temperature sensor which may comprise a discrete thermistor a thermocouple and or an integrated circuit. The temperature sensor s may or may not include an integrated humidity sensor. The temperature sensor s may be integrated into a microcontroller or radio IC. A temperature measured by the temperature sensor s may be reported back to the head unit periodically and or upon the occurrence of an anomalous condition.

The radio communications may operate using an IEEE 802.15.4 protocol compliant communication scheme. In some embodiments the ZigBee standard which is built on top of the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol may be used in communication. In one embodiment a proprietary communication scheme may be used that is built on top of the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol yet avoids the ZigBee specific features. For example the Thread protocol developed by Nest Labs Inc. of Palo Alto Calif. may be used for wireless communication between the base unit and the intelligent thermostat as described in U.S. Ser. No. 13 926 312 Ref. No. NES0310 US supra. This particular communication protocol requires that the radio in the base unit be paired with the radio in the intelligent thermostat. This pairing may be done before the intelligent thermostat system is sold to a consumer. The pairing may also be done after installation using an electronic device interface such as a smart phone interface the button on the backplate and or any of the USB terminals on the intelligent thermostat or base unit. In some embodiments a mixed protocol may be used that utilizes the Thread communication scheme but also operates as a mixed protocol where paired devices can also communicate with a larger network of smart home devices.

The base unit circuit board also includes a pair of diversity antennas . In this particular embodiment the diversity antennas are made of a raised stamped metal that sits above the base unit circuit board . It is been discovered by the inventors that mounting the base unit directly to a boiler often involves mounting the base unit to a large piece of sheet metal. The sheet metal of the boiler often causes interference with antenna reception. Therefore the diversity antennas were raised off the circuit board in order to prevent this type of interference and improve the radiation pattern. The raised nature of the diversity antennas can be seen in . Note that the diversity antennas are oriented with one 90 rotated from the other. If one of the diversity antennas does not receive a signal clearly the other of the diversity antennas should have better reception based on this antenna orientation. The base unit circuit board may include a large ground plane within a layer of the base unit circuit board located behind the diversity antennas in order to increase their performance.

In order to interface with the boiler system a relatively large relay circuit is used to make connections between the satisfied common and call for heat wire connections. A power PCB relay such as the RTB7D012 available from Tyco Electronics can be used in conjunction with an inductive load driver such as the NUD3124 from On Semiconductor to selectively make connections between these wire connections. The power PCB relay may operate with the regulated 12 VDC output from the flyback converter.

Having described the physical assembly the circuit components and the functional operation of the base unit the various wiring configurations for coupling the base unit to a boiler system will now be described. illustrates a terminal wiring diagram of a base unit according to some embodiments. The base unit may include seven wire connectors. The neutral connector and live connector may generally be used to connect a power supply for the base unit such as the flyback converter described above to a 220 VAC mains power line protected by 3A fuse. Various configurations may also connect the neutral connector and or the live connector to a corresponding input on the boiler system.

A second bank of wire connectors may include a satisfied connector a common connector and a call for heat connector . Each of these three wire connectors may be coupled to the base unit relay which may correspond to the power PCB relay described above. The base unit relay may short the common connector to the satisfied connector the common connector to the call for heat connector and or open connections between these three wire connectors .

A third set of wire connectors may include a pair of connectors that provide power from the base unit to the intelligent thermostat. In installations where a wired connection exists or can be installed between the base unit and the intelligent thermostat the wires may be inserted into the pair of connectors at the base unit and the corresponding wire insertion points on the intelligent thermostat backplate. The power supply for the thermostat may come from the regulated power supply in the base unit and provide for example 12 VDC to the intelligent thermostat. Note that in installations where no wires are present the pair of connectors can remain unconnected.

Note that in this configuration as well as the other configurations that will be discussed below the neutral and live mains power lines are connected to the neutral and live inputs of the base unit. This provides input power to the flyback converter of the base unit that is used to power the base unit and converted into DC voltages to power the other components of the intelligent thermostat system. Additionally each of these configurations may connect the two terminals T T to the backplate of the intelligent thermostat to provide power and or communications if such wires are present.

As described above the two wire connection between the intelligent thermostat backplate and the base unit can be used to provide power such as 12 VDC from the base unit to the intelligent thermostat. Additionally the two wire connection between the base unit and the backplate can also be used to communicate a call for heat command from the intelligent thermostat to the base unit. Special circuitry can be implemented in the backplate to send voltage current pulses to the base unit to call for heat.

It will be understood by one having skill in the art that many different signaling methodologies may be used to transmit a signal through the two wire connection from the thermostat to the base unit. Using a current pulse train is advantageous because small pulses may reduce the amount of heat generated by the thermostat and may reduce the power required by the intelligent thermostat system as a whole. However other embodiments may generate sinusoids step functions and or any other type of waveform that could be detected by the base unit in order to effectively communicate a call for heat. Therefore the current pulse train is merely exemplary and not meant to be limiting. It is also possible to use a variety of modulation demodulation schemes to transmit information across the wire pair.

In order to reduce the self heating effect of generating current pulses each current pulse may have a relatively small duty cycle and width. For example each current pulse could have a 1 duty cycle with a 10 ms width. The rise and fall time on the edges can be large enough to avoid EMI issues.

In current trace begins at a baseline current that is drawn from the base unit by the thermostat when the head unit is in a higher state of activity. For example the rechargeable battery can be recharging the user interface can be activated and or a Wi Fi burst may be sent from the thermostat to a home LAN. In this case the steady state level of current draw will be higher than when the head unit is in a lower state of activity. Note that the current waveform remains the same but is shifted up by the amount of additional current drawn by the head unit. In particular the shape of the current pulses are the same as current pulses . In order to detect current pulses in the inactive state as well as current pulses in the active state a reference level can be chosen such the current drawn of the head unit in either the active state or the inactive state during normal operation will not trip the reference level while the current pulses in either state will trip the reference level . Although not shown explicitly in another embodiment may allow the current draw of the head unit in the active state to cross the reference level . In order to detect the current pulses the circuitry may detect a sequence of negative positive negative positive crossings of the reference level with an expected timing pattern. To prevent needing to adjust the reference level and to prevent needing excessive energy while providing the pulse in the active state a guard band can be inserted around each pulse where the current used by the head unit is temporarily limited. This would bring the current draw back down below the reference level during a time interval surrounding each pulse. The first negative crossing would signal the beginning of the guard band the first positive and second negative crossings would signal the rise and fall of the pulse and the final positive crossing would signal the end of the guard band.

In order to detect a train of current pulses signifying a call for heat from the thermostat the base unit is able to detect when the thermostat draws more current using a current shunt monitor . The current shunt monitor can be used to sense current changes across the shunt independent of the supply voltage. In one embodiment the INA199 family of current shunt monitors available from Texas Instruments may be used. The output from the current shunt monitor can be fed into one of the ADC inputs of the base unit processor microcontroller. A reference level can be established for the current shunt monitor using resistors organized in series as a voltage divider . By sampling the ADC input the MCU can then detect instances when the current pulses occur. If a differential ADC input stage is used the output of current shunt monitor will be measured relative to the reference set by voltage divider . This may prevent the amplifier from saturating at its negative input rail and allow accurate calibration and measurement of signals close to zero current. The microcontroller may set a comparator reference level in the ADC circuitry to provide an interrupt when the level has been crossed.

One having skill in the art will readily recognize that changing the characteristics of the pulses can be used to encode many different types of information and messages from the thermostat to the base unit. Additionally signaling circuitry could be placed in the base unit and detection circuitry could be placed in the thermostat in order to achieve bidirectional communication on the power lines. The height of the current pulses may be set to a level that is not normally crossed during regular operation in order to reduce false positive detections. The height of the current pulses may also be set to a level that is above a noise level that is commonly experienced on the power lines. In some embodiments the thermostat may sample the characteristics of the current on the power line and dynamically adjust the height of the current pulses to be above the noise level while minimizing the power draw by the thermostat communications.

However users may often walk by the thermostat without intending to interact with it. In these cases it may be advantageous for the thermostat to remain inactive so as not to waste power or distract a user who walks by the thermostat . In order to distinguish between users who are simply near the thermostat and users who intend to interact with the thermostat the first proximity detector and the second proximity detector may be directed in different angles. In this embodiment the first proximity detector may be angled towards the floor while the second proximity detector may be directed outward from the thermostat .

The dual proximity detector configuration described above works well when the thermostat is mounted to a wall of the enclosure. Both proximity detectors are able to readily view the area directly in front of the intelligent thermostat . However when the thermostat is mounted on a stand and set on a desk table bookshelf and or the like as illustrated by the field of view for the first proximity detector may be obscured by the surface upon which the thermostat rests. In this case the thermostat would have a difficult time distinguishing between users simply walking by the thermostat and users who intend to interact with the thermostat because zone as seen by the first proximity detector would be obscured by the desk table bookshelf etc.

In order to overcome this problem in desktop mounting configurations a special intelligent thermostat stand has been designed. illustrate perspective side and rear views respectively of an intelligent thermostat stand according to some embodiments. The intelligent thermostat stand includes mounting holes that are aligned with the screw holes in the backplate of the intelligent thermostat. The mounting holes may include metal threaded inserts that are configured to accept mounting screws extending through the backplate. In order to help align the intelligent thermostat as it is being installed in the intelligent thermostat stand protrusions may be included that are aligned with screw holes in the back of the backplate. Therefore a user can set the backplate in the mounting stand in perfect alignment using the protrusions and then install the mounting screws through the mounting holes . The intelligent thermostat stand may also include a cavity through which the two wire connection can be inserted or alternatively or additionally through which a USB connection can be inserted and coupled to the USB port of the backplate to provide power.

The intelligent thermostat stand also includes a reflective surface at the base of the stand. Reflective surface is able to reflect energy from the surrounding environment into the first proximity detector that would otherwise not be visible to the first proximity detector. This allows both proximity detectors to have a view of the surrounding environment and be used to detect occupancy patterns and user approach scenarios that indicate a user is likely to interact with the intelligent thermostat. In some embodiments the thermostat may be secured to the thermostat stand such that the thermostat is tilted upwards forming an angle of between 90 and 110 with the reflective base . The slight tilt may allow for a better reflective pattern and allow more energy to be detected by the first proximity detector. Reflective base may be constructed using a reflective material. In one embodiment the reflective base may be constructed to include a stainless steel or metallic finish. Other embodiments may use any other smooth reflective surface that reflects energy rather than absorbs energy. One embodiment of the thermostat uses passive infrared PIR sensors as the proximity detectors. Another embodiment may also use an active infrared sensor or microwave sensor to detect proximity. Each of the sensor types may be configured to work best with a particular type of reflective material that corresponds to the sensor s used.

Algorithms were previously developed that use the responses of the two proximity detectors to detect occupancy patterns and or approaching users intent on interacting with the thermostat. When set on a surface as illustrated in the same algorithms would generally not provide reliable results without the reflective surface . However using the reflective surface on the thermostat stand the same or similar algorithms can be used to detect occupancy and or imminent interactions with nearly the same efficiency. Algorithms for detecting occupancy patterns and or imminent interactions with the thermostat are more fully described in U.S. Ser. No. 13 632 112 Ref. No. NES0157 US supra and U.S. Ser. No. 13 632 070 Ref. No. NES0234 US supra.

During the installation of the intelligent thermostat system the method may include determining whether the thermostat should act as a programmer . This determination may be made using a sequence of user interface displays presented to the user on a user interface of the intelligent thermostat. In some embodiments the installation process may include an interview style series of questions that the user can answer by rotating the outer wheel of the head unit and clicking to signify an input. One such question may explicitly ask the user whether a programmer was previously installed in the enclosure. A follow up question could then ask the user whether they would like the intelligent thermostat system to act as a programmer and control the heating schedule of the boiler.

In another embodiment determining whether the thermostat should act as a programmer may be made automatically without requiring user input. In configurations where the base unit is connected to the boiler through the programmer the programmer will cut power to the base unit during times when the boiler is scheduled to turn off by the programmer. In sending routine communications to the base unit the thermostat can detect that the base unit is unpowered when communications go unanswered. Alternatively the base unit may detect when it is losing power and may send a message to the thermostat before local power reserves are depleted. Alternatively if the thermostat is wired to the base unit it may detect when the low voltage power is removed indicating power to the base has been removed. If the thermostat detects that the base unit is unpowered it can automatically determine that the user intends to continue using the programmer in series with the intelligent thermostat system and that the intelligent thermostat should not act as a programmer. Alternatively the user could leave the programmer connected to the intelligent thermostat system during a learning period during which the thermostat could monitor the operation of the programmer to learn its schedule. In this case the user could provide input through the user interface of the head unit directing the thermostat to act as a programmer and learn the programmer schedule by monitoring the activity of the existing programmer. The user could then remove the programmer after the learning period is over and the thermostat has detected the programmer schedule.

The method may also include determining a programmer schedule to control the boiler . When the intelligent thermostat system is configured to act as a programmer it must then determine the times when the user wants the boiler to be off and on. In one embodiment the user interface of the head unit can continue with the interview style questions and ask the user about the existing programmer schedule. For example the user could be asked questions about which days the programmer was on or off and the hours during those days during which the programmer instructed the boiler to be active. Very complicated schedules may be designed through this user interview process. illustrate examples of user interface displays that may be presented to a user during the installation process. The information presented and questions asked in each interface display may build on the information received in response to previous questions. In some embodiments the user can enter a plurality of time intervals during which the boiler should be turned off according to the previous programmer schedule.

Turning back to determining the programmer schedule may also be done automatically without requiring user inputs. As described above the existing programmer can be left connected to the base unit during a learning interval. During this time the thermostat can monitor when the programmer cuts power to the base unit and thereby infer times during which the programmer has directed the boiler to turn off. After a predetermined learning interval such as one day one week two weeks and or the like the user may be instructed by the user interface to remove the programmer and connect intelligent thermostat system directly to the boiler system.

After determining the programmer schedule by learning the schedule automatically or receiving the schedule manually from the user the thermostat may begin operating the activity of the boiler according to the schedule. There may be times during the initial operational period of the intelligent thermostat system when the user wishes to manually call for heat during times when the boiler is off according to the programmer schedule implemented by the thermostat. Therefore the method may further include receiving a manual heating command from the user . In some instances the manual heating command may be received through the user interface of the head unit. For example the user may rotate the body of the head unit and adjust a setpoint temperature. In other instances the manual heating command may be received at the base unit. For example the user may press a button accessible on the exterior of the base unit and manually call for heat.

The method may further include determining whether the boiler is on or off according to the programmer schedule . During times when the boiler is on the thermostat may operate normally and cause the boiler to circulate heated water steam through the enclosure for example by opening a valve to a particular zone controlled by the thermostat. During times when the boiler is off according to the programmer schedule implemented by the thermostat the base unit can cause the boiler to actively heat water steam and begin to circulate such through the enclosure. In effect receiving the manual heating command allows the user to override the preset programmer schedule implemented by the thermostat and call for heat at any time.

In addition to causing the boiler to heat provide water steam to the enclosure in response to a manual call for heat other operations of the thermostat may also be affected according to the programmer schedule implemented by the thermostat. The intelligent thermostat system can use a learning algorithm to automatically establish and adjust setpoint temperatures for regulating the temperature within the enclosure. During the initial operational interval of the thermostat after installation the learning algorithm can monitor setpoint temperatures as entered by the user and automatically create and schedule setpoint temperatures that are dynamically adjusted over time to mimic the user s setpoint temperatures that were sent manually. After learning the user schedule the thermostat can automatically adjust the setpoint temperatures based on what it has learned without requiring the user to manually adjust the schedule or manually program the thermostat. One learning algorithm is described in detail in the commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 8 630 740 Ref. No. NES0162 US which is incorporated by reference herein.

Because the learning algorithm uses manual adjustments of the setpoint temperature to create a temperature schedule each interaction with the thermostat is typically used by the learning algorithm. However when the thermostat is also implementing a programmer schedule it is possible that the user will manually call for heat during times when the boiler is off. Some embodiments may disregard the heating command in the learning algorithm when the boiler is off. In these cases there is a conflict between what may be a user implemented programmer schedule and a single interaction with the thermostat. In some embodiments disregarding the heating commands when the boiler is off may only occur during an initial learning interval of the thermostat s operation. For example during the first two weeks after installation manual heating commands may be disregarded by the learning algorithm when the boiler is on but after two weeks these manual commands may be used by the learning algorithm to adjust both the setpoint temperatures and the programmer schedule implemented by the thermostat. After the initial learning interval or during times when the boiler is on the manual heating commands may generally be regarded by the learning algorithm as a valid input and adjust the schedule accordingly .

By using the same schedule as the learning algorithm the learning algorithm can populate the remaining setpoint temperatures based on user interactions with the thermostat. illustrates the same setpoint temperature schedule as that also includes temperature setpoints populated by the learning algorithm. Note that the 9 C. setpoints directing the boiler to turn off have been preserved as the learning algorithm operates. However additional setpoints may be added 18 19 17 etc. as the learning algorithm monitors user behavior. Note that after the learning interval is over and manual heating adjustments while the boiler is off are allowed to affect the temperature setpoint schedule the 9 C. temperature setpoints may also be adjusted.

For clarity of description time intervals for which the now bypassed programmer had previously maintained the boiler in an off state are referenced hereinbelow as previous programmer off time intervals. For further clarity of description the schedule setpoints corresponding to the previous programmer off time intervals such as the 9 degree C. setpoints of are referenced hereinbelow as previous programmer off setpoints. According to one embodiment learning algorithms such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 8 630 740 supra are configured to treat the previous programmer off setpoints as being largely immutable in a manner similar to the way that schedule interface setpoints are treated. Briefly stated according to one or more methods similar to those described in U.S. Pat. No. 8 630 740 supra schedule interface setpoints are setpoints that have been directly entered according to their desired setpoint time and setpoint temperature value by the user using the scheduling facility of the thermostat user interface and or the smartphone tablet browser user interface. In contrast many of the other setpoints in the schedule of the intelligent schedule can be called learned setpoints that are the result of the application of a schedule learning algorithm to immediate control inputs e.g. the user walks up to the dial and changes the current setpoint temperature or uses their smartphone tablet browser to change the current setpoint temperature and or to other sensed or received inputs that could be suggestive of a desirable ambient temperature condition. It being found that most users are more satisfied with the intelligent thermostat when their schedule interface setpoints are maintained regardless of their subsequent behaviors the preferred learning algorithms are designed to maintain schedule interface setpoints until such time as the user actually alters or removes them later using the scheduling facility. Thus according to one embodiment the previous programmer off setpoints are maintained and are not altered by the thermostat s schedule learning algorithms remaining as they are until such time as the user actually goes into the scheduling facility and removes or alters them. According to a different embodiment the previous programmer off setpoints are treated like schedule interface setpoints for a first fixed time period such as two weeks but are then treated as ordinary learned setpoints thereafter by the automated schedule learning algorithms being changeable as a function of user immediate control inputs or other sensed user or household behaviors. In still another embodiment a multiple staged approach is provided wherein the previous programmer off setpoints are treated like schedule interface setpoints for a first fixed time period such a week or two then treated a little bit less like schedule interface setpoints and more like ordinary learned setpoints for a send time period such as a week or two and then treated as ordinary learned setpoints thereafter by the automated schedule learning algorithms. For purposes of description one might think of the learning thermostat s schedule setpoints a having differing degrees of stickiness or resistance to being changed by the schedule learning algorithms with ordinary learned setpoints having a relatively low degree of stickiness and with schedule interface setpoints being extremely sticky. According to still other embodiments the stickiness of the previous programmer off setpoints can be gradually altered over time on a many staged or even continuous basis from being very highly sticky to less sticky as time goes by.

As described above pressing the button on the base unit may direct the intelligent thermostat system to begin heating regardless of the state of the boiler. In some embodiments pressing the button may turn the boiler on and circulate heated water steam for a predetermined time interval such as one hour. In other cases pressing the button may turn the boiler on and circulate heated water steam until a second press of the button directs the intelligent thermostat system to turn the boiler off again. In other cases pressing the button may turn the boiler on and may leave the boiler on until the thermostat directs the boiler to turn off according to the temperature setpoint schedule such as the schedule illustrated in .

As described above an intelligent thermostat system may include many features that rely on gathering user data automatically over time analyzing the user data with specific algorithms and implementing thermostat actions based on the analyzed user data. For example intelligent thermostat systems may use one or more proximity sensors to detect when a home is unoccupied and automatically adjust the temperature accordingly. This feature may be referred to as an auto away feature. Additionally a time to temperature algorithm analyzes the thermal inertia of a room and determines how long it will take to transition the ambient air temperature between temperature setpoints. Other features such as automatic sunlight correction automatic self heating correction sensor confidence algorithms user profiles and or the like may rely on learning algorithms based on collected user data. Also sensor data may measure thermal properties of the enclosure or environmental conditions. User data along with other sensor responses may be referred to herein as parameters. 

The results of the learning algorithms are typically valid as long as the thermostat stays mounted in the same location and may occasionally remain valid so long as the thermostat is in the same room of the enclosure. However when the intelligent thermostat is moved from one room to another room within the enclosure the thermal characteristics of the room may change the ability of sensors to correctly detect occupancy patterns and user interactions may change the effect of other environmental conditions may increase or decrease and or the temperature schedule may no longer be relevant. In short the user data analyzed by the learning algorithms may no longer be valid and the thermostat features based on the analyzed user data may no longer operate as a user expects.

In order to compensate for thermostat movements a method may include determining whether the thermostat has changed locations . Determining whether the thermostat has changed locations may include receiving an indication from a user that the thermostat is moved. For example a menu item on the user display may allow a user to provide input indicating that the thermostat is in a new location. Alternatively or additionally the thermostat may automatically determine when it has moved based on sensor readings. For example the intelligent thermostat may include a GPS receiver or accelerometer that could provide movement data alerting one of the processors on the thermostat that thermostat movement has likely occurred. In another example a radio signal strength may be measured for both the Wi Fi radio and or the radio used to communicate between the base unit and the thermostat. Changes in the strength of the radio signal may indicate that the thermostat has moved. In another embodiment the thermostat can detect a loss of power such as when a user unplugs the thermostat to move the thermostat to a new room. As power is restored to the thermostat the thermostat may automatically infer that it has moved or automatically query the user through the user interface as to whether the thermostat has moved. In another example an increased level of user activity in interacting with the thermostat such as manually adjusting setpoint temperatures may indicate that the environment has changed i.e. users may notice that the thermostat is not operating as desired and manually adjust the temperature more often in the new room. In another example the intelligent thermostat may determine that the thermal characteristics of the surrounding environment have changed. If temperature sensors indicate that the heating time is significantly different from the time predicted by a time to temperature algorithm the thermostat could automatically determine that the thermostat is in a new thermal environment.

It should be noted that detecting changes in the thermal environment can be used in situations where the thermostat has not itself moved but where the thermal characteristics of the room have changed. For example users may install new window coverings users may install new heating options such as radiant flooring or ceiling fans prolonged seasonal changes may have an effect on the thermal characteristics of the enclosure and or the like. In these cases this method may be used to automatically recalibrate the thresholds and time estimates calculated by the learning algorithms.

After determining whether the thermostat has changed locations or determining that the thermal characteristics of the enclosure have changed significantly the method may include invalidating existing location dependent data sets and depending upon the situation different user data sets may be invalidated and in some cases replaced . For example if the new location is in a room similar to the old location the time to temperature data may remain valid. If the new location places the thermostat in view of the old location then the occupancy data may still be valid. In some embodiments the thermostat can continue operating with thresholds set by the old user data in order to determine which data sets are still valid.

After determining which data sets need to be replaced the method may additionally include restarting the learning algorithms and collecting new user data . New occupancy patterns can be detected new thermal characteristics of the enclosure can be determined and or the like.

Some embodiments of the intelligent thermostat system may include other features that may be advantageous in certain circumstances. In some embodiments the base unit may include a temperature humidity sensor that can be used to detect dangerous conditions. For example a temperature sensor in the base unit can be used to detect if the boiler is overheating and becoming a fire risk. A humidity sensor can be used to determine basement flooding conditions and or conditions that may facilitate growth of mold or rot.

Some embodiments may also provide additional antenna options. For example the internal diversity antennas may be used by default in the base unit along with a hidden antenna port to attach an external antenna with a coaxial feed cable. This allows service professionals to install a higher gain directional antenna if the internal antenna signal is not strong enough. Inserting the external antenna could automatically disable the internal antennas through a mechanical sensing fixture. For example the external antenna connector could include a screw down connector that has a mechanical switch to disconnect the pass through path to the diversity antennas when an external antenna is inserted. In other embodiments the external antenna connector may include a small shield segment that is not connected to ground. Once the external antenna is attached the shield will short to ground. This can be detected by the internal processor and the external antenna can be selected. In other embodiments the external antenna can simply short the antenna feed to ground as part of its construction. This allows the base unit to detect that the feed and ground are shorted once the antenna is screwed in place externally. In other embodiments attaching the external antenna will change the impedance as seen by the power amplifier which will change the current consumption of the amplifier. That change could be detected by the internal processor and the external antenna can be selected. In other embodiments the base unit can use the existing wires in the wall as a waveguide to carry wireless signals to the thermostat. For example a 2.4 GHz signal transmitted across the power line has been shown to extend wireless communication range and be compatible with wiring such as thermostat cable or plastic shielded 12AWG Romex power cable. This situation may be particularly advantageous when the building material used to separate floors in the enclosure is particularly thick or causes a high level interference.

The auxiliary antenna may be implemented using many different antenna types. For example the auxiliary antenna may comprise a monopole antenna a dipole antenna a loop antenna and or the like. In some embodiments the auxiliary antenna may comprise a dipole coaxial antenna that is connected to the base unit through a coaxial insertion point. The auxiliary antenna may be connected to the base unit by inserting a jack into a base unit receptacle. The auxiliary antenna may also be connected to the base unit using a mated pair of BNC connectors. In some embodiments the auxiliary antenna may be screwed into a threaded receptacle in the base unit. Note that these examples are listed for illustrative purposes only and not meant to be limiting. Any mechanical connection may be used to connect the auxiliary antenna to the base unit.

Connection of the auxiliary antenna can be detected in many different ways. Some embodiments may employ mechanical sensing systems to mechanically detect a physical connection of the auxiliary antenna to the base unit. For example separation switches or contact switches may be used to detect when the auxiliary antenna is inserted into the base unit screwed to the base unit or otherwise coupled to the base unit. Additionally or alternatively some embodiments may employ electrical sensing systems to electrically detect the presence of an auxiliary antenna. One such electrical sensing system will be described in detail below in relation to .

The method may also include disconnecting an onboard antenna . The onboard antenna may be disconnected by activating a mechanical or electrical switch in order to disconnect the onboard antenna from the base unit wireless communication module including for example the base unit radio and the front end module from . In some embodiments the onboard antenna may be disconnected by instructing the base unit wireless communication module to no longer send or receive communications through the onboard antenna. Therefore disconnecting the onboard antenna may encompass an electrical and or mechanical disconnection.

The method may additionally include transmitting receiving wireless communications through the auxiliary antenna . Transmitting receiving wireless communications through the auxiliary antenna may occur automatically once the onboard antenna is disconnected. In some embodiments the base unit wireless communication module can automatically redirect communications through pins connected to the auxiliary antenna. In some embodiments the base unit wireless communication module can use a single pin to send receive wireless transmissions and electrical mechanical switches outside of the base unit wireless communication module can select between the auxiliary antenna and the onboard antenna.

The method may further include detecting the removal of the auxiliary antenna reconnecting the onboard antenna and transmitting receiving wireless communications through the onboard antenna. Generally the process of switching from the auxiliary antenna back to the onboard antenna may follow the reverse procedure as described above. For example electrical mechanical sensing circuits can detect the removal of the auxiliary antenna and electrical mechanical switches can reconnect to the onboard antenna. The base unit wireless communication module can then again begin transmitting receiving wireless communications through the onboard antenna.

Although this method of switching between an auxiliary antenna and an onboard antenna is described in relation to the intelligent thermostat system of this disclosure all embodiments need not be so limited. In general this method of detecting and switching between antennas could be used in any wireless communication system. For example the smart home depicted in may include many intelligent sensor devices that communicate wirelessly throughout an enclosure. Any of these wireless sensor devices may benefit from this antenna switching method during installation testing and or normal operation.

As described above the pair of diversity antennas may be oriented at 90 angles such that one of the pair of diversity antennas may have better reception than the other. In some embodiments the wireless communication module can select one of the pair of diversity antennas and thereafter communicate through the selected antenna. When switching between an onboard antenna and an auxiliary antenna the wireless communication module can use a switch to disconnect one or both of the pair diversity antennas . The switch can be implemented with a FET switch or a mechanical relay.

In some embodiments the auxiliary antenna may comprise a coaxial dipole antenna . The coaxial dipole antenna can be connected to the base unit circuit board through a BNC connector or any other type of coaxial connector. For purposes of illustration the coaxial dipole antenna connector is expanded to show connectors and for the coaxial dipole antenna that can be mated with the connectors and of the base unit circuit board .

In order to detect the connection of the coaxial dipole antenna connectors and can be connected to pins and of the wireless communication module respectively. Pin can also be connected to a DC voltage such as V. In some embodiments pin can be connected to the voltage through an impedance . Similarly pin can be connected to ground and this connection can be through an impedance in some embodiments. The ground may comprise a backplane ground and or a reflective ground for the pair of diversity antennas . For example the ground may comprise a ground plane on the underside of the base unit circuit board .

When the coaxial dipole antenna is not connected to the base unit circuit board the DC voltage at pin will be approximately ground 0 V . The wireless communication module can read the voltage at pin and if the voltage at pin is approximately ground then the wireless communication module can determine that the coaxial dipole antenna is not connected to the base unit circuit board and therefore that the wireless communication module should transmit receive wireless communications through the pair of diversity antennas through switch .

The coaxial dipole antenna may include a circuit element that connects connector to connector . The circuit element may comprise a wire an inductor or any other conductive material or circuit element. In some embodiments the circuit element can be sized to operate like a quarter wave 4 impedance transformer. For example the circuit element can be sized such that the path from pin through connectors and through circuit element through connectors and to pin is approximately wavelength. For example if the wireless communication module operates at 2.4 GHz corresponding to a wavelength of 12.5 cm then the circuit element can be sized such that the length of the path described above can be approximately 6.25 cm. By sizing the circuit element to operate as a quarter wave impedance transformer the circuit element can provide a DC short between connector and connector . The 4 wave transformer will transform the short circuit into an open circuit which has no effect on the RF signals on the line. Likewise an open circuit can be transformed into a short circuit for RF signals. Therefore the circuit element will look like an open circuit to the RF emissions of the wireless communication module .

When the coaxial dipole antenna is connected to the base unit circuit board the DC voltage at pin will measure a voltage higher than ground. The exact voltage will depend upon the ratio of impedance and impedance . Thus the wirelessly communication module can read the voltage at pin . If this voltage is higher than ground or close to a known voltage determined by the impedance ratio then the wireless communication module can determine that the coaxial dipole antenna is connected to the base unit circuit board . In response the wireless communication module can open switch and thereby disconnect the pair of diversity antennas . Therefore when the coaxial dipole antenna is connected to the base unit circuit board the circuit element will provide a short circuit for DC signals while simultaneously providing an open circuit for RF signals. A single pair of pins and can be used to both send and receive RF transmissions from the wireless communication module and to detect a connection of the coaxial dipole antenna .

The circuit arrangement of may offer several advantages. First the mere connection of the coaxial dipole antenna can automatically cause the wireless communication module to disconnect the pair of diversity antennas . Additionally the number of pins on the wireless communication module required for such operations can be minimized. It will be understood that the circuit arrangement of is merely exemplary and not meant to be limiting. Many other hardware software embodiments of the general method described in relation to will be readily apparent in light of this disclosure.

In circuit diagram pin can be used to detect whether or not the antenna is connected externally. When the antenna is disconnected pin will sense a Vcc voltage pulled up through impedance . When the antenna is connected the antenna will produce a DC ground at pin through impedance and the antenna . As described above the antenna can be configured to produce an RF open circuit between connectors and .

It should be noted that the circuit examples illustrated in are merely exemplary and not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may implement the principle of connecting an external antenna to produce a DC ground or voltage using different circuit elements and or arrangements. For example the Vcc and Gnd signals may be reversed in additional impedances may be added the switch may be combined with the output of pin such that only a single RF output needs to be provided by the wireless communication module and so forth. Many other circuit arrangements would be readily apparent to one having skill in the art in light of this disclosure.

Whereas many alterations and modifications of the present invention will no doubt become apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art after having read the foregoing description it is to be understood that the particular embodiments shown and described by way of illustration are in no way intended to be considered limiting. Therefore reference to the details of the preferred embodiments is not intended to limit their scope.
