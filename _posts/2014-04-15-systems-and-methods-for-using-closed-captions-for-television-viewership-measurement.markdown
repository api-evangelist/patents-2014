title: Systems and methods for using closed captions for television viewership measurement
abstract: To provide audience measurement services without requiring broadcasters to install additional watermarking equipment, a small video capture device may receive a video signal viewed by an audience member, the signal including embedded closed captioning data, and may decode and transmit the closed captioning data to an audience measurement server. The measurement server may receive the data and compare the received data to a database of closed captioning text to identify matches. The database may be populated via one or more additional capture devices receiving local or national broadcast signals, or with data separately provided by broadcasters. When a match is found, the measurement server may determine that the audience member is watching a program having the corresponding closed captioning. Dynamically generated confidence scores may allow for reliable identification of audience members of content, even with very short closed captioning data lengths.

Audiences for content blocks such as broadcast media or online streamed media including commercial advertising are typically measured via single source data panels consisting of individuals or households recording content exposure over time. In one typical system panel members carry a portable pager sized device with a microphone that listens for embedded subaudible codes or watermarks in audio of media programs. The device records the codes it hears indicating that the panel member was present while the program was being shown or played. The device periodically transmits its logs to a measurement server which aggregates logs from a plurality of the devices to determine a total viewership for the program.

As the codes or watermarks used by these devices must be inaudible or psychoacoustically concealed within the program error rates are high and bitrates of data are very low. The device must listen to the audio signal for a substantial duration to be able to collect a complete code reducing its effectiveness for short programs. Additionally because codes must be embedded into the audio signal by the broadcaster each broadcast station or cable provider must have an encoder in the signal chain increasing cost and providing a potential source of failure.

Federal Communications Commission FCC regulations require all United States broadcasters to provide closed captioning for television programs. In analog television broadcasts compliant with National Television System Committee NTSC standards closed captioning is encoded into line 21 of the vertical blanking interval in EIA 608 format developed by the Electronic Industries Alliance EIA and frequently referred to as line 21 captioning . For digital television broadcasts compliant with Advanced Television System Committee ATSC standards closed captioning is provided via three encoded streams two of which provide backward compatibility with NTSC decoders the third providing up to 63 additional captioning streams encoded in EIA 708 format sometimes referred to as CEA 708 format . As the closed captioning is content specific the encoded text may be used to identify specific programs being watched by a viewer and accordingly may be used for audience measurement via the systems and methods disclosed herein. Because each broadcaster already is generating and embedding the captioning these systems and methods do not require any additional encoders to be installed at stations or cable providers.

In some implementations a small monitor or capture device may be installed at a participating panel member s home or other viewing location and may receive the NTSC and or ATSC video signal from a cable or HDTV decoder set top box digital video recorder DVR receiver television output or other such source. The capture device may decode the closed captioning signal e.g. the encoded line 21 signal and or embedded EIA 708 streams and may transmit the decoded text or a hash of the decoded text to an audience measurement server.

The measurement server may receive the text or hash from the capture device and compare the received data to a database of closed captioning text to identify matches. The database may be populated via one or more additional capture devices receiving local or national broadcast signals or with data separately provided by broadcasters. When a match is found the measurement server may determine that the panel member is watching a program having the corresponding closed captioning. Matching may be performed using very short windows as small as 8 words or less allowing quick identification of programming including identification of interstitial advertising during longer programming. Comparisons need not be perfect but may be identified as matching if the match rate exceeds a threshold. For example if the database is populated via a national feed of a program and a panel member s monitor receives a signal including local advertising the closed captioning may match during the program but not match during commercials. In such situations larger matching windows may be used or confidence measures or hysteresis may be applied such that the measurement server may still identify the panel member as watching the program. These systems and methods may be used with time shifted content or content recorded and played via a DVR or by other such devices as well as on demand streamed or downloaded content provided line 21 or EIA 708 captioning is implemented.

One implementation disclosed herein is a method for audience measurement. The method includes receiving by an audience measurement engine executed by a processor of a first device from a remote device a first identification of closed captioning data received by the remote device during playback of an item of content. The method also includes matching by the audience measurement engine the first identification of closed captioning data received by the remote device to a second identification of closed captioning data stored in a database in a storage device of the first device. The method further includes retrieving by the audience measurement engine an identification of the item of content associated in the database with the second identification of closed captioning data responsive to the match. The method also includes adding by the audience measurement engine a device identifier of the remote device to an audience list of the identified item of content stored in the storage device.

In some implementations of the method the first identification of closed captioning data comprises closed captioning text. In other implementations of the method the first identification of closed captioning data comprises a hash of closed captioning text. In one implementation the method includes receiving by the audience measurement engine a second identification of closed captioning data received by a second device and adding the second identification of closed captioning data to the database. In a further implementation the second device is operated on behalf of the audience measurement engine. In another further implementation the method includes receiving an identification of the item of content associated with the second identification of closed captioning data and adding the identification of the item of content to the database with the second identification of closed captioning data.

In some implementations the method includes calculating a hash of the first identification of closed captioning data and identifying within the database an entry identifying an item of content at an index corresponding to the calculated hash the index equal to a result of a hash of the second identification of closed captioning data. In other implementations the method includes receiving by the audience measurement engine from the remote device a second identification of closed captioning data received by the remote device during playback of the item of content. The method also includes matching by the audience measurement engine the second identification of closed captioning data received by the remote device to a third identification of closed captioning data stored in the database. The method also includes retrieving by the audience measurement engine the identification of the item of content associated in the database with the third identification of closed captioning data responsive to the match. The method further includes determining by the audience measurement engine that the device identifier of the remote device is included in the audience list of the identified item of content and increasing by the audience measurement engine a confidence score associated with the device identifier of the remote device in the audience list of the identified item of content. In a further implementation the method includes decreasing by the audience measurement engine the confidence score associated with the device identifier of the remote device in the audience list of the identified item of content responsive to not matching an identification of closed captioning data received by the remote device to a corresponding identification of closed captioning data associated with the item of content stored in the database within a predetermined time period. In another further implementation the method includes incrementing by the audience measurement engine an audience measurement counter for the item of content for each device identifier included in the audience list of the identified item of content having a confidence score greater than a threshold.

Another implementation disclosed herein is a system for audience measurement including a capture device comprising a video input a closed captioning decoder connected to the video input and a first network interface for transmitting a first identification of closed captioning data received by the capture device during playback of an item of content to an audience measurement server. The system also includes an audience measurement server comprising a processor executing a measurement engine and a second network interface for receiving the identification of closed captioning data. The measurement engine is configured for matching the first identification of closed captioning data received by the capture device to a second identification of closed captioning data stored in a database in a storage device of the audience measurement server. The measurement engine is also configured for retrieving an identification of the item of content associated in the database with the second identification of closed captioning data responsive to the match and adding a device identifier of the capture device to an audience list of the identified item of content stored in the storage device.

In some implementations of the system the first identification of closed captioning data comprises closed captioning text. In other implementations of the system the first identification of closed captioning data comprises a hash of closed captioning text. In some implementations the measurement engine is further configured for receiving a second identification of closed captioning data received by a second capture device and adding the second identification of closed captioning data to the database. In a further implementation the second capture device is operated on behalf of the audience measurement engine. In another further implementation the measurement engine is further configured for receiving an identification of the item of content associated with the second identification of closed captioning data and adding the identification of the item of content to the database with the second identification of closed captioning data.

In some implementations the measurement engine is further configured for calculating a hash of the first identification of closed captioning data and identifying within the database an entry identifying an item of content at an index corresponding to the calculated hash the index equal to a result of a hash of the second identification of closed captioning data. In other implementations the measurement engine is further configured for receiving from the capture device a second identification of closed captioning data received by the remote device during playback of the item of content and matching the second identification of closed captioning data received by the capture device to a third identification of closed captioning data stored in the database. The measurement engine is also configured for retrieving the identification of the item of content associated in the database with the third identification of closed captioning data responsive to the match. The measurement engine is further configured for determining that the device identifier of the capture device is included in the audience list of the identified item of content and increasing a confidence score associated with the device identifier of the capture device in the audience list of the identified item of content. In a further implementation the measurement engine is further configured for decreasing the confidence score associated with the device identifier of the capture device in the audience list of the identified item of content responsive to not matching an identification of closed captioning data received by the capture device to a corresponding identification of closed captioning data associated with the item of content stored in the database within a predetermined time period. In another further implementation the measurement engine is further configured for incrementing by the audience measurement engine an audience measurement counter for the item of content for each device identifier included in the audience list of the identified item of content having a confidence score greater than a threshold.

Also disclosed herein is an implementation of a computer readable storage medium storing instructions that when executed by one or more data processors cause the one or more data processors to perform operations including receiving from a remote device a first identification of closed captioning data received by the remote device during playback of an item of content. The operations also include matching the first identification of closed captioning data received by the remote device to a second identification of closed captioning data stored in a database in a storage device. The operations further include retrieving an identification of the item of content associated in the database with the second identification of closed captioning data responsive to the match and adding a device identifier of the remote device to an audience list of the identified item of content stored in the storage device.

These implementations are mentioned not to limit or define the scope of the disclosure but to provide an example of an implementation of the disclosure to aid in understanding thereof. Particular implementations may be developed to realize one or more of the following advantages.

Measurement of an audience of content such as television programming movies commercial advertising or any other type and form of content may be useful for measuring audience size or popularity of content for pricing and selling advertisement placements planning content delivery schedules or other such purposes. In traditional terrestrial or satellite broadcasting a provider may not have direct knowledge of the number of receivers tuned in at any time due to the lack of a back channel or communication pathway from the receiver to the provider. To overcome this limitation some audience measurement systems have used panels of participating individuals who agree to fill out surveys or diaries of content they ve seen or listened to. However this system relies on self reporting which may have decreased accuracy. Another system requires panel participants to wear or carry a portable device that detects content played back in the vicinity via subaudible audio watermarks or codes and records a log for subsequent transmission to the panel provider. However this system requires watermarking encoders to be installed at every broadcast source to be measured as part of the signal chain increasing expense and failure rates. Additionally embedded codes may be distorted or corrupted when data compression is applied such as in digital video recorders or other systems.

Many broadcasters including all television broadcasters in the United States already provide closed captioning for broadcast television programs including programs delivered via terrestrial or satellite broadcasts cable broadcasting video on demand systems or Internet streaming. Many of these systems include closed captioning data encoded in EIA 608 and or EIA 708 formats within the video signal format. The closed captioning data is content specific and accordingly may be used to identify specific programs being watched by a viewer for audience measurement.

Content may be received by a client system at a receiver which may comprise an antenna or satellite dish and demodulator or decoder a cable receiver a digital television DTV decoder a set top box a DVR a computing device or any other type and form of device for receiving content with closed captioning data. The receiver may be connected to a multimedia system such as a television home theater system or any other type and form of device for displaying audio and or video content received and decoded by a receiver . In some implementations the receiver and multimedia system may be combined as in many televisions with attached antennas or included cable demodulators smart or Internet attached televisions or other such devices.

In some implementations a small monitoring or capture device may be installed or deployed at a participating panel member s home or other viewing location and may receive a video signal including closed captioning data e.g. an ATSC or NTSC video signal with embedded closed captioning from a receiver and or multimedia system e.g. cable or HDTV decoder set top box DVR television output multimedia receiver or switcher output or other such source . For example in one implementation the capture device may be physically wired to the receiver or multimedia system while in other implementations the capture device may wirelessly receive the video signal including closed captioning data. For example in one such implementation the receiver and or multimedia system may include a wireless transmitter streaming video content to a display such as a Bluetooth connection to a projector or other such system . In such implementations the capture device may also receive the transmitted video signal. In other implementations the capture device may comprise a receiver and may receive transmissions directly such as terrestrial broadcast television signals. In some such implementations the capture device may be portable and may be carried by the participating panel member. Accordingly installation or deployment of the capture device may refer to physical installation or may refer to the capture device being in a location to receive a video signal with closed captioning data. In any of these implementations the capture device may decode the closed captioning signal e.g. the encoded line 21 signal and or embedded EIA 708 streams and in some implementations may transmit the decoded text or a hash of the decoded text to an audience measurement server discussed in more detail below via a network .

Network may be any form of computer network or combinations of networks that relay information between one or more client capture devices and one or more audience measurement servers as well as other devices not illustrated. For example network may include the Internet and or other types of data networks such as a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN a cellular network satellite network or other types of data networks. Network may also include any number of computing devices e.g. computer servers routers network switches etc. that are configured to receive and or transmit data within network . Network may further include any number of hardwired and or wireless connections. For example a client device may communicate wirelessly e.g. via WiFi cellular radio etc. with a transceiver that is hardwired e.g. via a fiber optic cable a CAT5 cable etc. to other computing devices in network . In some implementations a network may be a virtual network such as a virtual network between a plurality of virtual machines executed by a single physical machine or a abstract network such as an offline transfer of data via physically movable media e.g. a Sneakernet transferring data via tape media CD ROM flash media external hard drives floppy disks etc. . For example in one such implementation a client device may capture and store closed captioning information for subsequent transfer to a computing device via a universal serial bus USB or similar interface to be transmitted by said computing device via a network .

As shown in some implementations a measurement system may also include a receiver which may be similar to a receiver at a client system. Receiver may receive content from a broadcaster via terrestrial or satellite broadcast cable system Internet or any other such means and may output video to a measurement service capture device . In some implementations a receiver may be in the same geographical region as a receiver . For example at least one receiver may be deployed in each city including one or more panel members to capture the same broadcast from a local broadcaster . In other implementations a receiver may be deployed elsewhere and may receive a similar but different broadcast. For example a receiver may receive a national network broadcast via a cable system while a receiver may receive a terrestrial broadcast from a local affiliate of the national network broadcaster. Such local affiliate broadcasts may include similar content but may have different interstitial advertising local newscasts or other inserted or modified content. Although only one receiver is illustrated in some implementations a plurality of receivers may be deployed at a location e.g. one per broadcaster to be measured. In other implementations a receiver may have a plurality of tuners demodulators or sub receivers and may be able to receive and output a plurality of broadcasts simultaneously to a corresponding plurality of measurement service capture devices .

The measurement system may include one or more measurement service capture devices similar to a client capture device . The capture device may decode the closed captioning signal e.g. the encoded line 21 signal and or embedded EIA 708 streams and in some implementations may transmit the decoded text or a hash of the decoded text to an audience measurement server . The transmission may be via a network an internal or local network or via another interface. For example the measurement service capture device may include a USB Bluetooth or serial output for connection to a corresponding input device of an audience measurement server .

Although shown grouped in a measurement system in some implementations a receiver need not be located in geographic proximity to a measurement service capture device and or an audience measurement server . For example a receiver may communicate with a measurement service capture device via a network such as the Internet and or a measurement service capture device may communicate via a network with an audience measurement server . For example in one implementation a receiver and or measurement service capture device may be deployed at a broadcast transmission site or studio and receive a pre transmitter video feed or a feed from a monitoring receiver at the site or studio and may transmit decoded closed captioning data to the audience measurement server via a network .

An audience measurement server may comprise one or more computing devices servers desktop computers rack mount computers workstations or other devices for receiving closed captioning data from client capture devices and measurement service capture devices and for correlating or matching the received data to determine if devices received the same content at a particular time. In some embodiments an audience measurement server may be a virtual machine or machines executed by one or more physical machines such as in a cloud service or server farm. Audience measurement servers may be located in proximity to measurement service capture devices or may be remote from one or more measurement service capture devices and may communicate with the devices over a network .

As shown in some implementations a measurement system may include a database or storage device storing closed captioning data referred to generally as a closed captioning database . Closed captioning data for the database may be received from the measurement service capture device or may be received directly from a broadcaster . For example in one implementation closed captioning data may be intercepted before encoding in the video signal and or decoded via a monitoring output at a broadcast site or studio and may be transmitted via a network for storage in a closed captioning database . In a similar implementation closed captioning data may be provided in non real time from the broadcaster for inclusion in a closed captioning database . For example the broadcaster may separately provide text or data files of closed captioning data to be embedded in a video signal during broadcast of a movie or television program sometimes hours days or weeks in advance of broadcast. Similarly the broadcaster may provide text or data files of closed captioning data for one or more items of content in a VOD library. When a user subsequently requests an item of content from the VOD library and closed captioning data is decoded and transmitted by a client capture device to an audience measurement server the received data may be matched to the text or data files previously received from the broadcaster and stored in database .

Although shown separate from audience measurement server in many implementations closed captioning data may be part of the audience measurement server or maintained by the audience measurement server . Accordingly in such implementations the audience measurement server may receive closed captioning data from broadcaster s and or measurement service capture device s and may store the data in the closed captioning database .

Closed captioning database may comprise a relational database flat file data file or any other type and form of database. In some implementations closed captioning text may be stored in the database as text. In other implementations a portion of closed captioning text e.g. a number of words or characters such as 5 words 8 words 10 words 50 words or any other such value an amount of data in a number of video fields such as closed captioning data from one video field 10 video fields or any other such value or an amount of data within a predetermined period of time such as closed captioning data embedded within 5 seconds of video 10 seconds of video or any other such value may be hashed or used as an input to a hashing algorithm with the result entered into the database or used as an index to an entry in the database. Closed captioning database may also include an identification of an item of content associated with the closed captioning data or portion of the closed captioning data. For example in implementations in which closed captioning data is received in non real time from a broadcaster the data may be explicitly identified as associated with an item of content. In other implementations in which closed captioning data is received via a receiver and decoded by a measurement service capture device the data may be associated with an item of content based on a broadcast schedule embedded metadata or other such information. In still other implementations the data may be associated with a channel and broadcast time that the content was received by a receiver and may be subsequently associated with the item of content based on a broadcast schedule such as during a subsequent step of audience measurement.

The measurement server may receive closed captioning data or a hash of the data from a client capture device and compare the received data to the database of closed captioning data to identify matches. In implementations in which closed captioning data is received and the database stores closed captioning text directly the measurement server may use a search algorithm for a text string including the received text. In implementations in which the captioning data is hashed or stored in hashed form in the database as discussed above the measurement server may determine if an entry exists in the database at an index identified by the hash calculation value such that existence of such entry with an associated identification of a content indicates that the received data from client capture device matches data received from a measurement service capture device or from a broadcaster . Responsive to a match the measurement server may determine that the item of content was received and played by receiver to a multimedia system and presumably was watched by the panel participant accordingly the measurement server may identify the participant as an audience member of the item of content.

In implementations in which a hash is calculated from a string of closed captioning data a sliding window may be used to calculate hashes of closed captioning data for inclusion in the database or for comparison of closed captioning data received from a client capture device . For example if the database is populated via hashes of strings of closed captioning data twenty words in length then in some implementations a comparison of a hash of received data from word number five to word number twenty five may not match a hash of data from word one to word twenty. Accordingly in such implementations a sliding window e.g. 1 20 2 21 3 22 etc. may be used either for comparing hashes of received data from client capture device or for populating the database . Window length may be chosen to reliably identify an item of content with larger windows having greater uniqueness but requiring more data to create a match. To further increase uniqueness of closed captioning strings associated with content older content or closed captioning data may be removed from the database. For example many broadcast programs are presented daily or weekly e.g. nightly newscasts or episodic sitcoms with identical introductions etc. . Closed captioning data from these programs may be removed from the database after a corresponding time period of a day or week eliminating the possibility of data received from a client capture device matching both a current presentation and a previous presentation of the same program.

In other implementations closed captioning data received from a client capture device may be compared to closed captioning data in a database for a best but not perfect match. For example strings of closed captioning data may be compared to find strings that match above a predetermined threshold such as 50 75 90 or any other value. Depending on the threshold and string length this may eliminate the need for a sliding window comparison or allow for a large slide in a window e.g. windows that overlap by 50 such as strings of words 1 20 11 31 21 41 etc. as matching closed captioning strings will always match at a rate above the threshold even if they do not start with the same word or character. With particularly long windows or string lengths longer than typical commercial breaks matches may be detected if a program is the same even if interstitial or local advertising received by the client capture device is different.

As discussed above encoders may receive closed captioning data from one or more sources such as a caption input interface and or a closed captioning data file and may encode or embed the data in EIA 608 and or EIA 708 format or other similar formats. Closed captioning may be inserted for live programming such as live sports or news broadcast events via input interfaces e.g. computing devices keyboards text to speech converters etc. or may be provided by program producers or third party services for pre recorded content such as movies or television programs. Closed captioning data files may be sent to an encoder via automation or other systems for synchronized embedding during playback for on air broadcasting.

In some implementations output of an encoder may be provided to a transmitter such as a satellite transmitter terrestrial transmitter microwave transmitter or cable modulator may be provided to a web server for streamed broadcasting and or may be provided to a VOD server for transfer to a client responsive to a request. In some implementations media content from a source and closed captioning data may be provided separately to a VOD server without embedding or for embedding via a client side interface.

The output of video input or video splitter may be provided to a closed captioning decoder referred to generally as a decoder . Decoder may comprise hardware software or a combination of hardware and software. For example in one implementation decoder may comprise a CMOS integrated circuit IC such as a MC 144144 series IC manufactured by Motorola Inc. of Schaumburg Ill. or an equivalent IC a programmable IC or field programmable gate array FPGA or any other type and form of circuit or combination of circuits. In another implementation the capture device may include a processor and memory device and may execute a software decoder which may read a digital input or output of an analog to digital converter connected to video input .

Decoder may output one or more strings of closed captioning data. For example EIA 608 allows for four channels of information. In some implementations decoder may output a plurality of these channels while in other implementations decoder may output a single channel or be selectively set to output a single channel. Similarly EIA 708 allows for 63 channels plus two backwards compatible EIA 608 channels and decoder may be set to output one or more of the embedded channels.

In some implementations a hash calculator . Hash calculator may comprise hardware software or a combination of hardware and software for performing a hashing calculation on a string of output data from closed captioning decoder . For example hash calculator may comprise an IC PIC FPGA or other hardware programmed to perform a cryptographic or non cryptographic hashing function such as a message digest algorithm MD hash e.g. MD2 MD4 MD5 MD6 etc. secure hash algorithm SHA hash or any other type and form of hashing function. In other implementations a hash calculator may comprise a software algorithm stored in memory and executed by a processor on an output of a decoder . As discussed above a hash calculator may perform a hashing calculation on any number of characters or words and may utilize a sliding window to perform hashing calculations on overlapping data sets output from a decoder .

In some implementations an output of decoder and or hash calculator may be buffered in a buffer such as a First in First out FIFO buffer ring buffer or similar memory structure. As a single field of closed captioning data may be just a few words or characters it may be more efficient to collect a few kilobytes or more of closed captioning data and or hash calculation results before transmitting data over a network. Accordingly in such implementations data may be buffered in buffer for a predetermined period of time or a predetermined amount of data may be buffered for subsequent transmission.

In some implementations an output of a buffer and or decoder or hash calculator may be transmitted or streamed via a network interface to an audience measurement server. A network interface may comprise any type and form of network interface including a wired interface e.g. Ethernet including 10 Base T 100 Base T or 1000 Base T Gigabit a wireless interface e.g. 802.11a 802.11b 802.11g 802.11n 802.11.ac Bluetooth Bluetooth Low Energy Near field Communication NFC a cellular interface or any other type of interface for transmitting data over a network. In some implementations network interface may comprise a parallel or serial interface such as a USB interface an IEEE 1394 Firewire interface an RS 232 interface an RS 485 interface or any other type and form of interface to another computing device. In many implementations a second computing device may serve as an intermediary for communications to an audience measurement server. For example in one such implementation a capture device may communicate via a USB interface with a desktop computer which may transmit captured closed captioning data via an Ethernet interface to a network gateway or switch connected to the Internet for transmission to an audience measurement server. In such implementations network interface may be referred to as a communications interface. In some implementations the capture device may store decoded and or hashed data in a memory for subsequent synchronization or transfer via a computing device connected to a network .

As discussed above in many implementations a capture device may include a processor . Processor may comprise any type and form of processing unit including a microprocessor application specific integrated circuit ASIC FPGA etc. or combinations of these or other processing units. In many implementations processor may be a multi core processor or an array of processors. A capture device may also include memory which may include but is not limited to electronic optical magnetic or any other storage devices capable of providing processor with program instructions. Memory may include a floppy disk CD ROM DVD magnetic disk memory chip ROM RAM EEPROM EPROM flash memory optical media or any other suitable memory from which processor can read instructions and in some implementations to which processor can write decoded or hashed closed captioning data for subsequent transmission via network interface . The instructions may include code from any suitable computer programming language such as but not limited to C C C Java JavaScript Perl HTML XML Python and Visual Basic.

In some implementations a capture device may include a device identifier . Device identifier may be an alphanumeric string data string serial number media access control MAC address internet protocol IP address username or account name globally unique identifier GUID cookie random or pseudorandom number or any other type and form of identifier including combinations of these or other identifiers to identify the capture device . In some implementations the device identifier may be fixed to the device or preconfigured in the device such as a manufacturer serial number or MAC address while in other implementations the device identifier may be dynamically set by a panel provider by the audience measurement server or other entity such as via a cookie or username. In some implementations a unique or new device identifier may be set for each communication to the audience measurement server while in other implementations the device identifier may not be changed or may be changed periodically e.g. hourly daily weekly etc. or at other intervals e.g. on restart of the capture device login to an internet service etc. . Device identifier may be transmitted to the audience measurement server before with or subsequent to a transfer of decoded and or hashed closed captioning data such that the data may be identified as having been captured by the device . For example in one embodiment a capture device may log in or establish an authenticated session with an audience measurement server using the device identifier . In another embodiment the capture device may transmit closed captioning data in the body of a packet with the device identifier included in the header of the packet. For example closed captioning data may be transmitted via a representational state transfer REST protocol hypertext transfer protocol HTTP request e.g. a POST or GET request with captioning data as a parameter value pair or via any other such application session or presentation layer protocol. In other implementations closed captioning data may be transmitted via an options field of a transport layer protocol packet header such as a transport control protocol TCP or user datagram protocol UDP packet. In other implementations closed captioning data may be provided as a serial bit stream.

In some implementations a capture device may include a power supply . Power supply may comprise a battery AC power supply DC power supply USB power supply Power over Ethernet PoE power supply inductive power supply or any other type and form of power supply. Although illustrated internal to a capture device in many implementations a power supply may be external from device such as an external AC to DC converter.

In many implementations a capture device may be very small such as only a few cubic inches in size or less. As many of the features of a capture device may be implemented with small integrated circuits the capture device may be inexpensive to manufacture and may be unobtrusive when installed in a panel participant s home or other viewing location.

An audience measurement server may include one or more storage device or capture device interfaces and one or more network interfaces . As discussed above in many implementations a capture device may communicate with an audience measurement server via a network to a network interface . Network interface may comprise any type and form of network interface such as a wired interface e.g. Ethernet a wireless interface e.g. 802.11a 802.11b 802.11g 802.11n 802.11.ac Bluetooth Bluetooth Low Energy NFC interface etc. a cellular interface or any other type of interface for receiving data from capture devices .

In many implementations as discussed above an audience measurement server may be deployed locally to an audience measurement capture device . In such implementations the capture device may connect via a network interface or via a capture device interface including a parallel or serial interface such as a USB interface an IEEE 1394 Firewire interface an RS 232 interface an RS 485 interface or any other type and form of interface. In many implementations an audience measurement server may connect to one or more storage devices such as hard drives flash drives redundant arrays of independent disks RAID arrays network attached storage NAS devices storage area network SAN devices or any other type and form of storage. Such storage devices may store closed captioning data as discussed above received from one or more broadcasters one or more audience measurement capture devices or other data. For example a storage device may store audience measurement data discussed in more detail below.

An audience measurement server may include one or more processors including one or more microprocessors ASIC circuits FPGAs etc. or combinations of these or other processing units. In many implementations processor may be a multi core processor or an array of processors. In other implementations a processor may comprise a virtual processor executed by a physical processor. Processor may be configured for executing a measurement engine and or hash calculator as well as for communicating with capture devices and or storage devices via network interface and capture device interface .

An audience measurement server may also include memory which may include but is not limited to electronic optical magnetic or any other storage devices capable of providing processor with program instructions. Memory may include a floppy disk CD ROM DVD magnetic disk memory chip ROM RAM EEPROM EPROM flash memory optical media or any other suitable memory from which processor can read instructions and to which processor can write data. As shown in some implementations a closed captioning database may be stored in memory rather than an external storage device.

Memory may include a measurement engine . Measurement engine may comprise an application service server daemon routine subroutine or other executable logic for comparing closed captioning data or an identifier of closed captioning data such as a hash result received from one or more client capture devices with closed captioning data received by a measurement capture device and or stored in a closed captioning database . Measurement engine may execute one or more matching or comparison functions such as a search function a lookup function or any other such function. In some implementations a measurement engine may maintain an audience measurement database . Audience measurement database may comprise any type and form of database including a data file flat file relational database structured database etc. for storing identifications of content and or broadcast channels and time periods and a corresponding set of device identifiers of client capture devices that captured closed captioning data matched to corresponding data for the content captured by measurement capture device or received from broadcasters . A measurement engine may count unique device identifiers associated in the database with an item of content to determine an audience measurement for the content.

In some implementations an audience measurement database may store confidence scores of matches of each device identifier to an item of content. In such implementations device identifiers having low confidence scores may be removed or excluded from the audience measurement count. is a diagram illustrating comparison of captured closed captioning data and generation of a confidence measurement for inclusion of a device in an audience measurement according to one implementation. In some implementations a measurement service capture device may capture closed captioning data embedded in a television program such as a program having segments and . The capture device may also capture closed captioning data embedded in interstitial alternative content such as advertising program promotions breaking newscasts or other such content. This closed captioning data may be associated by an audience measurement server with program and content based on a broadcast schedule or metadata received from a broadcaster .

A client capture device may also receive video for the broadcast program but may receive different alternative content. For example as discussed above the measurement service capture device may receive a national network feed from the broadcaster while the client capture device may receive a local affiliate feed with local advertising weather news etc. Closed captioning data captured by the client capture device may be identical or highly similar to captioning data captured by the measurement service capture device during program segments A and B but may be different during alternative content segments 

For live audience measurements it may be useful to determine the number of panel participants or capture devices that are receiving a particular program at a specific time but to prevent false positives from panel participants who quickly flip through different channels to determine what to watch captured data may be filtered using a confidence measure . The confidence measure may increase for each matched segment of closed captioning data during a program and may decrease for unmatched segments. For example as shown in the graph of the audience measurement server may increase confidence measure throughout time t during which closed captioning data captured by capture device matches that captured by capture device or received from a broadcaster for the program . During times tand t the audience measurement server may decrease confidence measure due to matching closed captioning data not being identified. Through time t the audience measurement server may again increase the confidence measure as matches are identified. Once the confidence measurement exceeds a threshold n the audience measurement server may increment an audience counter for the program and or add a device identifier of the client capture device to a confirmed audience list for the program. Although discussed in terms of television program segments and interstitial advertising typically around 10 minutes and 3 minutes in length respectively times tmay be of any duration. For example a program segment may refer to a two minute news segment during a broadcast or an act of a movie. Rates of confidence measure increase and decrease and threshold n may be configured to confirm audience membership based on any desired cumulative viewing time.

As shown in some implementations an audience measurement server may apply hysteresis or pause for a predetermined time period before decreasing a confidence measure e.g. at time t. This may allow for temporary differences in closed captioning content that do not indicate that the panel participant is viewing a different program e.g. emergency alert system EAS alerts or tests broadcast by a local affiliate during a national feed of a program short station identifiers etc. . If no matches are identified by expiration of the predetermined time period e.g. expiration of a timer set to the time period etc. then the audience measurement server may begin decrementing the confidence measure .

Still referring to and in more detail at step a capture device such as a client capture device or a measurement service capture device may receive a video signal. The capture device may receive a signal from a receiver such as a receiver connected at a panel participant s home or other viewing location or at a measurement service data center or office or may receive a video signal from a switcher monitoring output or other source at a broadcast studio transmitter site or other such location. The video signal may comprise an analog NTSC or digital ATSC signal a phase alternating line PAL video signal a sequential color with memory SECAM signal a digital video broadcasting DVB signal or any other type and form of signal having one or more channels of embedded closed captioning data such as data in an EIA 608 and or EIA 708 format. The capture device may receive the signal via an input port such as a composite component RF baseband HDMI or other video input interface and in some implementations may split the signal to a closed captioning decoder and simultaneous output interface for connection to a recorder television or other device.

At step the capture device may decode the closed captioning data in the video signal. In some implementations the capture device may decode a plurality of channels or strings of data such as a first channel for a first language and second channel for a second language while in other implementations the capture device may decode only a first default or predetermined channel. In some implementations the capture device may decode only text data while in other implementations the capture device may decode command data e.g. font style or color options placement options etc. . Such command data may further provide unique data to improve matching.

At step in some implementations the capture device may transmit the decoded closed captioning data to an audience measurement server. In many implementations the capture device may collect a predetermined amount of closed captioning data and may transmit the data periodically such as via a FIFO buffer or ring buffer or any other type of buffer as discussed above. Periodic transmissions may be based on a time period such as five seconds ten seconds one minute or any other such period or may be based on collection of a set amount of data such as 1 kilobyte 5 kilobytes 30 kilobytes etc. In some implementations transmission frequency may be dynamically set responsive to network conditions. For example higher frequencies may be set for low latency high bandwidth connections to a measurement server such as those on a Local Area Network LAN while lower frequencies may be set for high latency low bandwidth or heavily congested connections. Transmission of the data may be via any suitable protocol such as a RESTful application layer protocol such as via HTTP parameter value messages a simple mail transfer protocol SMTP a file transfer protocol or any other such protocol via raw data encapsulated in a transport layer protocol such as TCP or UDP packet or network layer protocol such as IP or via any other such protocol. In many implementations the protocol may be a lossless protocol however in other implementations particularly utilizing dynamic confidence measurements discussed above a lossy protocol may be used to reduce overhead. To avoid dropped packets resulting in lower confidence measurements hysteresis time periods may be configured to allow at least one subsequent transmission to be received before a measurement is decreased.

In some implementations transmission of decoded data at step may include transmission of a device identifier of the capture device. As discussed above the device identifier may be provided with the decoded data such as in an options field of a packet header as a cookie in a session identifier as a parameter value pair or any other such means. In other implementations the device identifier may log in or authenticate itself to the audience measurement server before transmitting decoded data. For example the capture device may establish an authenticated session with an audience measurement server and identify itself with its device identifier before sending decoded data or may connect to an audience measurement server or authentication server with its device identifier and may receive a cookie for use in subsequent data transfers. In still other implementations log in and or authentication may be provided by another device such as an Internet gateway deployed as an intermediary between the capture device and audience measurement server.

In some implementations decoded closed captioning data may be hashed at step . The capture device may perform any type and form of hashing algorithm on the closed captioning data including a cryptographic or non cryptographic hashing algorithm or one substantially free of hash collisions. In other implementations particularly with dynamic confidence measures as discussed above a hashing algorithm with some collisions may be acceptable provided collisions result in a low level of false positive matches. Hash results may be transmitted to the audience measurement server at step using any of the methods discussed above in connection with step . As discussed above in many implementations the hash results may be buffered for a predetermined time period or size of data collected prior to transmission.

At step the audience measurement engine may determine if the data was received from a broadcaster or service provider such as via a file transfer. If so then the data may include a content identification in metadata such as a file header file name or other data field. The content identification may identify the source of the content the content type a name of the content a day or time of day of broadcast of the content or any combination of these or other information. At step the audience measurement engine may receive the content identification and or extract the content identification from the received data. The audience measurement engine may determine that the data was received from the broadcaster or service provider responsive to the inclusion or presence of the metadata responsive to a method of receipt e.g. file transfer via a network attachment via email etc. or responsive to other such indicators e.g. data file size being above a threshold equivalent to a maximum buffer size in a capture device etc. .

At step in some implementations the audience measurement engine may calculate a hash of the received closed captioning data or a portion of the data. For example the measurement engine may select a window of data such as 20 words 120 characters 150 bytes 500 bytes or any other size window of closed captioning data and may calculate a hash value of the data. The hash result may be used as an index to a closed captioning database and the content identifier may be stored at the corresponding database entry at step . In some implementations a sliding window algorithm may be used and overlapping portions of closed captioning data may be hashed. For example the measurement engine may receive a large closed captioning data set from the broadcaster or service provider. In some such implementations the measurement engine may break the received set up into a plurality of portions or windows for separate hashing and indexing such as windows of 10 words 20 words 100 bytes etc. In such implementations steps may be repeated iteratively for each successive window or portion until all of the received data is hashed and indexed.

In still other implementations the closed captioning data may be used as the index value directly in such implementations step may be skipped. The closed captioning data may still be broken up or apportioned into a plurality of shorter windows for subsequent comparison. In yet still other implementations the closed captioning data may be stored as a data file or array associated with the content identification and may be searched directly for data matching received phrases in subsequent matching steps. Accordingly in such implementations step may be skipped.

If the closed captioning data is not received from the broadcaster or service provider then at step the measurement engine may determine if the data is received from an audience measurement service capture device. The measurement engine may determine that the measurement service capture device is the source responsive to a device identifier received with the closed captioning data corresponding to a known device identifier of the capture device via the connection type e.g. a serial connection over USB rather than a TCP connection via the Internet or any other such means. Responsive to identifying the measurement service capture device as the source of the closed captioning data the measurement engine may retrieve a corresponding content identification at step . The content identification may be retrieved from a broadcast schedule such as published television listings for a channel monitored by the capture device. In other implementations the measurement engine may transmit a request to a broadcaster for an identification of currently playing content and may receive a corresponding content identification. As discussed above the received closed captioning data may in some implementations be hashed at step and or may be added to a closed captioning database. In some implementations such as where a broadcaster has previously provided closed captioning data for a program and the measurement capture device receives identical closed captioning data the measurement engine may confirm that the content identification associated with each set of data is identical. If the content identifications are identical the measurement engine may discard the latter set of data. If the identifications are not identical the measurement engine may replace an earlier received content identification with a later received content identification to update the closed captioning database with new information.

In many implementations and as discussed above the measurement engine may receive a large closed captioning data set from the measurement capture device. In some such implementations the measurement engine may break the received set up into a plurality of portions or windows for separate hashing and indexing such as windows of 10 words 20 words 100 bytes etc. In such implementations steps may be repeated iteratively for each successive window or portion until all of the received data is hashed and indexed.

If closed captioning data was not received from a broadcaster or measurement capture device then at step it may be determined that the data was received from a client device. In some implementations the measurement engine may receive a device identifier of the client device at step . As discussed above the device identifier may be received with the closed captioning data prior to receipt of the closed captioning data e.g. during an authentication session establishment or login process or subsequent to receipt of the closed captioning data.

At step in some implementations the measurement engine may calculate a hash of the received closed captioning data or a portion of the data. At step the measurement engine may determine if a content identifier exists at a corresponding hash index value entry in the closed captioning database. If no entry exists then an identical set of closed captioning data or a portion of the data has not been previously received by the measurement engine at least within a time period before removal of old entries from the closed captioning database as discussed above and the hash result may be discarded.

In many implementations a sliding window algorithm may be used and steps may be iteratively repeated for each new position of the window until a match is identified. In a further implementation the sliding window algorithm may only need to be performed in a first round of iterations for received closed captioning data. For example if a set of closed captioning data from a client capture device is identical to a set of data received from a measurement device but starting five words later then steps may need to be repeated only five times advancing the window one word at a time until a match is identified. For example given a window length of 20 words windows may be compared of words 1 20 2 21 3 22 4 23 5 24 and 6 25 at which point a match may be identified. Once a match is identified then to identify additional matching data within the received data set the window may be advanced by its full length e.g. matching words 6 25 then 26 45 46 65 etc. Thus once synchronized confirmation of matching of large identical closed captioning data sets may be performed very quickly.

In other implementations as discussed above closed captioning data may be used as the index of the closed captioning database directly and accordingly may not need to be hashed. In such implementations step may be skipped. Step may still be repeated as discussed above for iterations of a sliding window algorithm on subsequent portions of the closed captioning data without hashing.

When a match is identified then at step the measurement engine may identify an associated item of content and determine if the device identifier of the client device is in an audience database entry for the item of content. As discussed above each entry in the closed captioning database may include a corresponding identification of content added at step . Accordingly when the measurement engine looks up an index entry corresponding to a hash or portion of the data if an entry exists and a match is found then the measurement engine may simply retrieve the associated content identifier. Each content identifier may also be associated with an audience database or array of device identifiers of devices identified as having received the corresponding content. Upon identifying a match at step at step the measurement engine may determine if the device identifier of the client device exists within the array or database for the associated content identifier. If the device identifier does not exist within the array then at step the measurement engine may add the device identifier to the array or database. In a further implementation the measurement engine may add a default or starting confidence score for the device identifier being part of the audience to the array. If the device identifier does exist within the array then the device has previously been identified as having received the content accordingly in some implementations at step the measurement engine may increase a confidence score for the device identifier in the array associated with the content.

In a similar implementation the measurement engine may maintain a database or array of content associated with a device identifier in addition to or instead of a database or array of device identifiers associated with an item of content. For example rather than maintaining a list or array of devices identified as being part of the audience for a particular show the measurement engine may maintain a list or array of shows identified as having been received by a particular device. In some such implementations the measurement engine may subsequently search through a plurality of arrays associated with devices for a content identifier of an item of content to determine how many devices were part of the audience. In a similar implementation the arrays may be provided to a third party such as a panel provider for analysis and or audience measurement.

As discussed above in implementations in which the measurement engine receives a large closed captioning data set from the client capture device and breaks the received set up into a plurality of portions or windows for separate hashing and indexing steps may be repeated iteratively for each successive window or portion until all of the received data is hashed and indexed.

As discussed above in some implementations the measurement engine may decrease a confidence score for a client device identifier and previously matched item of content if a match is not identified at step in a subsequent iteration. For example in one such implementation the measurement engine may retain an identification of a device identifier and a previously matched item of content. The measurement engine may retain the identification for a predetermined period of time such as a minute five minutes an hour or any other such period. Responsive to determining that a portion of closed captioning data received from the client does not match any entries in the closed captioning database the measurement engine may decrement a confidence score associated with the client device identifier in an audience array for the item of content. In some implementations the confidence score may be decreased at a slower rate than it was increased at step e.g. the confidence score may be incremented by two points per match but decremented by one point per non match or any other such values . In other implementations as discussed above the measurement engine may not decrease the confidence score until a predetermined period of time has passed since the last matched closed captioning data such as 15 seconds 30 seconds 1 minute or any other such value. This may provide hysteresis for short local content in an otherwise identical broadcast program.

In some implementations audience measurement may be performed in real time incrementing a counter for each device identifier added to an audience array for an item of content and decrementing the counter and possibly removing a device identifier responsive to a confidence measure for the device identifier falling below a threshold. In other implementations audience measurement may be performed responsive to a request for an audience measurement or responsive to the end of an item of content being broadcast. is a flow diagram of the steps taken in one implementation of a process for measuring an audience of an item of content by an audience measurement server according to one implementation. At step the measurement engine may receive a request for an audience measurement for an item of content. The request may be received from a broadcaster advertiser producer panel provider marketer analyst or other entity. The request may identify one or more items of content and in some implementations may include a confidence measure threshold to utilize for the measurement.

At step in some implementations the measurement engine may determine if the item of content is still be broadcast or is over. If the content is still being broadcast then in some implementations the measurement engine may wait and repeat step until the item of content is over. The measurement engine may determine that the item of content is still being broadcast based on a published broadcast schedule responsive to metadata received from a broadcaster including program start and end times or based on other similar information. In other implementations step may be skipped for example for live audience measurements during a program.

At step the measurement engine may retrieve a first device identifier and in some implementations a confidence score or measure associated with the device identifier from an audience array or database for the item of content. At step in some implementations the measurement engine may determine if the confidence score is above a threshold n such as a predetermined threshold or a threshold received at step . If the confidence score is greater than the threshold n then at step an audience counter for the item of content may be incremented. If the confidence score is less than the threshold then step may be skipped. At step the audience measurement engine may repeat steps for each additional device identifier in the audience array until a total audience measurement for the item of content is generated. In implementations not utilizing a confidence score step may be skipped and the audience counter may be a direct count of the number of device identifiers in the audience array. At step the audience measurement may be output or provided as a response to the request for audience measurement.

Closed captioning databases and audience measurement databases or arrays may be periodically purged. For example device identifiers and confidence scores may be removed from an audience array after a program is complete and a measurement is generated. In other implementations the device identifiers and confidence scores may be removed from the array after an hour a day a week or any other amount of time. This may allow for aggregation of audience measurements including live audiences as well as audience members who record and time shift the program for later watching. Closed captioning databases may also be purged with entries removed after a predetermined amount of time such as prior to a next episode of a program or simply periodically.

As the systems and methods discussed herein utilize a capture device installed in series or parallel with a panel participant s television such panel participants must typically sign up or agree to participate in data collection. As only device identifiers and closed captioning data are transmitted from client capture devices privacy and anonymity of panel participants may be protected. To further enhance privacy in some implementations the device identifiers and or closed captioning data may be encrypted for transmission to the audience measurement server. Panel participants may also stop transmitting measurement data by removing a video input network connection and or power connection from the capture device and may resume at any time by reattaching said connection or connections.

In some implementations the panel participant may be provided with an opportunity to control whether or how to transmit measurement data to the audience measurement server. For example the client capture device may be configured to be disabled during certain times of day or with certain program material e.g. specified channels or responsive to the presence of specified V chip parental rating codes embedded within the video . Thus the panel participant may have control over how information is collected about him or her and used by the audience measurement servers panel providers and content providers.
