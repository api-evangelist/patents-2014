These and other features will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and claims.

It should be understood at the outset that although illustrative implementations of one or more embodiments are illustrated below the disclosed systems and methods may be implemented using any number of techniques whether currently known or not yet in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations drawings and techniques illustrated below but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.

With the rapid development of media creation and content distribution via wireless communication networks through cloud computing systems Cloud concerns are rising over security throughout the cloud systems. For example content distribution through cloud computing systems may be unsecure and unsafe. When confidential privacy related and or premium content related services are delivered through a cloud computing system safe and secure services may be desirable. Some of these services may not desire as high security as financial transactions medical records or the like but may desire higher level of secure execution than normal applications. For example charged online gaming services premium media streaming services web album services or the like may desire some level of secure services across the cloud computing systems.

Mobile communication devices with a trusted security zone hardware partition may perform secure execution of applications with server computers maintained by a wireless communications service provider or a wireless carrier that is a home carrier for the mobile communication device. However electronic devices other than mobile communication devices may not be equipped with a trusted security zone hardware partition. Those electronic devices may not be able to perform secure execution of applications or data exchange especially with server computers maintained by a non home carrier. The present disclosure teaches a system and method for installing a temporary trust enablement application on an electronic device for secure execution of trusted applications.

For example a provisioning status of trusted security subzone s on an electronic device may be examined by a server trusted security zone on the server or by a trusted application in the server trusted security zone on the server when the electronic device requests services from the server where those services desire secure execution or data exchange. The electronic device and the server may communicate with each other through a wired network a wireless network or some combination of the two. The server may be maintained by a home carrier of the electronic device or not. Based on whether or not a non provisioned trusted security subzone is detected on the electronic device the server may perform a variety of actions.

For example when no trusted security zone hardware partition has been found on the electronic device an encrypted key may be generated by the server. The encrypted key may be transmitted to the electronic device by the server. At the electronic device the encrypted key may be compared with a plurality of stored trust keys by a kernel of an operating system of the electronic device or by a relevant application in the operating system of the electronic device to determine the trustworthiness of the encrypted key. The plurality of stored trust keys may have been generated and transmitted to the electronic device before the electronic device requested the service. The kernel of the operating system may be requested by the server to perform a variety of action for secure execution of a trusted application related to the service the electronic device requested from the server. When the encrypted key is determined by the electronic device to be trustworthy a temporary trust enablement application may be installed by the server on the electronic device. The temporary trust enablement application may be a software application and may be executed by a processor of the electronic device. The trusted application may be transmitted by the server through an encrypted channel to the temporary trust enablement application on the electronic device.

The trusted application may be executed in the temporary trust enablement. The trusted application may be restricted to a subset of application programming interfaces APIs and hardware peripherals of the electronic device. Access to at least part of the processor may be blocked to other untrusted applications while the trusted application is executed. The at least part of the processor that was blocked while the trusted application was executed may be released when the trusted application execution is completed for example when the premium media streaming is completed. The trusted application the temporary trust enablement and the encrypted key may be removed when the trusted application is completed.

On the other hand when the electronic device requests services from the server wherein those services desire secure execution and when at least one trusted security subzone that has not been provisioned is found on the electronic device a temporary trust token may be generated by the server. The electronic device may comprise more than one trusted security subzone wherein some of the trusted security subzone may have been provisioned. When at least one trusted security subzone that has not been provisioned is found a temporary trust token may be generated by the server. The temporary trust token may be transmitted to the electronic device after the temporary trust token has been generated by the server. The temporary trust token may be compared by a trusted security zone installer on the electronic device with a plurality of stored trust tokens to determine the trustworthiness of the temporary trust token. The plurality of stored trust keys may have been generated and transmitted to the electronic device before the electronic device requested the service. When the temporary trust token is determined to be trustworthy by the trusted security zone installer the trusted security zone installer may transmit a notification to the server indicating that the trusted security subzone is ready to be provisioned. The server may then provision the non provisioned trusted security subzone to be a temporary trust enablement for example by transmitting a notification to the trusted security zone installer requesting the trusted security zone installer to provision the non provisioned trusted security subzone into a temporary trust enablement.

After the non provisioned trusted security subzone is provisioned with the temporary trust enablement the trusted security zone installer may transmit a message or notification to the server indicating the temporary trust enablement is ready to receive a trusted application relevant to the service the electronic device requested. The server may then transmit the trusted application through an encrypted channel to the temporary trust enablement. The trusted application may be executed in the temporary trust enablement in a way similar to how a trusted application is executed in a trusted security zone except that the trusted application has restricted access to a subset of APIs and hardware peripherals of the electronic device. The trusted application the temporary trust enablement and the temporary trust token may be removed when the trusted application is completed.

Turning now to a communication system is described. In an embodiment the communication system comprises a plurality of electronic devices a data store and a server . The server may comprise a server trusted security zone . The electronic device may comprise a processor an operating system and a memory . The memory may comprise a trusted security zone portion and a permissive sector . The trusted security zone may be a trusted security subzone . Said in other words the memory may comprise more than one trusted security subzone instead of only one trusted security zone . The trusted security zone may comprise a plurality of trusted applications and a plurality of trust keys . The permissive sector may comprise a plurality of non trusted applications . The electronic device may be configured to establish a wireless or wired communication link with a network . The server and the data store may also have access to the network . The network may comprise any combination of private and public networks.

It is understood that the system may comprise any number of electronic devices any number of data stores and any number of servers . The electronic device may be any of a server computer a desktop computer a laptop computer a notebook computer a tablet computer a mobile phone a personal digital assistant PDA a media player a headset computer a wearable computer a game console an Internet digital media streaming device a television or another network communications capable device. The server and the data store may be server computers. The server and the data store may locate in one computer for example a server computer in two different computers for example a server computer for the server and another computer for the data store in multiple different computers for example multiple server computers for the server and other multiple computers for the data store or in some other combination of computers. When the server and the data store do not locate in one computer the server and the data store may share the same wired or wireless local area network.

Non trusted applications are normal applications in the electronic device . When trusted applications are executed in the trusted security zone or a temporary trust enablement of the electronic device peripherals and data of the electronic device may not be accessible to the non trusted applications . The non trusted applications may be stored in a permissive sector in the memory . The permissive sector of the memory is the normal partition in the memory . When the memory is not partitioned into trusted security zone s and a permissive sector the non trusted applications may be stored in the memory . Additionally non secure resources may be stored in the permissive sector in the memory .

The server trusted security zone may be stored in a memory of the server . The server trusted security zone may communicate manage and or manipulate the trusted security zone on the electronic device . For example the server trusted security zone may provision the trusted security zone to be a temporary trust enablement under predefined circumstances. After the trusted security zone is provisioned to be the temporary trust enablement the server trusted security zone may communicate with relevant application s on the electronic device and or manage the temporary trust enablement.

For example a security monitor on the electronic device may ask the server trusted security zone about the trustworthiness of the temporary trust enablement. The server trusted security zone or a trusted application in the server trusted security zone may communicate with the security monitor on the electronic device to assure that the temporary trust enablement is trusted or deny that the temporary trust enablement is trusted based on the trustworthiness of the temporary trust enablement. When the temporary trust enablement is determined to be trustworthy the server trusted security zone may transmit a trusted application to the electronic device . During the execution of the trusted application on the electronic device the server trusted security zone and or the security monitor may monitor the status of the trusted application and communicate with each other about the status of the trusted application .

In an embodiment the trusted security zone is more than just a segment of memory. The trusted security zone may also have a dimension of processing. The trusted security zone may be enabled but not provisioned at the original equipment manufacturer OEM . When provisioned for example at the OEM the trusted security zone may provide the secure execution environment for trusted applications where only trusted applications may operate safe from attacks. The trusted security zone may be implemented by partitioning both hardware and software resources of the electronic device into two partitions a secure partition and a normal partition. The secure partition may be implemented by a distinct separate or dedicated physical processor usually the first processor from the processor by which the normal partition may be implemented usually the second processor. Alternatively the secure partition may be implemented by a distinct separate or dedicated virtual processor from the virtual processor by which the normal partition may be implemented. A server trusted security zone may be a server side trusted security zone and may communicate with the trusted security zone .

When the trusted security zone is not provisioned at the OEM the trusted security zone may be provisioned for example by the server to be a temporary trust enablement after the electronic device reaches the customer side under predefined circumstances. A temporary trust enablement may perform a variety of functionality similar to a trusted security zone except that a trusted application in the temporary trust enablement may have restricted access to a subset of application programming interfaces API and hardware peripherals of the electronic device . Also the temporary trust enablement unlike a trusted security zone may be allowed to exist for a limited period of time and may be removed after the execution of the trusted application is completed.

In an embodiment provisioning status of trusted security subzone s on the electronic device may be examined by the server for example by the server trusted security zone or by a trusted application in the server trusted security zone on the server under predefined circumstances. For example the provisioning status of trusted security subzone s may be examined after the electronic device requests premium media content download or another service from the server . The application in the server trusted security zone may transmit a message to the operating system of the electronic device to inquire about the provisioning status of trusted security subzone s on the electronic device . The server trusted security zone may take different action depending on the provisioning status of the trusted security subzone s on the electronic device .

For example when at least one trusted security sub zone is found to not have been provisioned on the electronic device a temporary trust token may be generated by the server . The temporary trust token may be transmitted to the electronic device by the server . The temporary trust token may be compared by a trusted security zone installer on the electronic device or some other relevant trusted application in the trusted security zone hardware partition with a plurality of trust tokens or trust keys stored on the electronic device to determine the trustworthiness of the temporary trust token. The trust keys may be stored in the same trusted security sub zone that has been found to not be provisioned. If the temporary trust token matches any of the stored trust keys the temporary trust token may be determined to be trustworthy. The trusted security zone installer may transmit a notification to the server indicating that the non provisioned trusted security sub zone is ready to be provisioned after the temporary trust token has been determined to be trustworthy.

The non provisioned trusted security sub zone on the electronic device may be provisioned to be a temporary trust enablement by the server . For example the server may transmit a message or notification of provisioning the temporary trust enablement to the trusted security zone installer on the electronic device . The provisioned temporary trust enablement may be referred to as the temporary trust enablement hereinafter. After the temporary trust enablement is provisioned on the electronic device a trusted application may be transmitted by the server through an encrypted channel to the temporary trust enablement for example the trusted application may be encrypted and then sent to the temporary trust enablement . The trusted application may be an application that renders the service requested by the electronic device or an application among a plurality of applications that cooperate to render the service requested by the electronic device . The trusted application may be stored in the temporary trust enablement in the memory and may be executed in the temporary trust enablement .

When the trusted application is executed only trusted application s may operate and non trusted applications may be prohibited from executing. Security may be further promoted by restricting access of non trusted applications to peripherals such as data inputs and data outputs while the trusted application is running in the temporary trusted enablement . The temporary trust enablement may be monitored by the security monitor application. For example the security monitor may monitor the execution status of the trusted application and or may communicate with the server trusted security zone about the observed execution status of the trusted application .

When the trusted application is executed in the temporary trust enablement access to at least part of the processor may be blocked for example to non trusted applications . In an embodiment instead of executing the trusted application continuously the trusted application may be executed in a discrete manner for example every other predefined number of clock cycles of the electronic device . The operating system of the electronic device may be suspended when the trusted application is executed. However some operating system interrupt routines may still interrupt the execution of the trusted application for example incoming phone rings.

The trusted application may have restricted access to a subset of APIs and hardware peripherals of the electronic device . For example the trusted application may have restricted access to input and output ports of the electronic device related to video streaming when the trusted application is an application related to premium video streaming services. For example the trusted application may be an application that downloads premium media content from the server or the data store . The trusted application may be an application that uploads private media content to the server or the data store . The trusted application may be an application that provides charged online gaming services. The trusted application may be an application that provides building access credentials. The trusted application may be an application that provides web album services or the like. The trusted application the temporary trust enablement and the temporary trust token may be removed when the trusted application is execution completed for example when the premium video streaming is completed.

On the other hand if no trusted security zone hardware partition is found on the electronic device when the provisioning status of trusted security subzone s on the electronic device is examined by the server an encrypted key may be generated by the server . When no trusted security zone hardware partition is found on the electronic device the memory may comprise only a permissive sector. A kernel of the operating system may be utilized to block the at least part of the processor when a trusted application transmitted to the electronic device is executed. The server may interrogate the electronic device to determine which suspend modes of the processor the kernel of the operating system supports. When the suspend modes are determined and transmitted back to the server the server may transmit the encrypted key to the electronic device .

The encrypted key may be compared with a plurality of stored trust keys to determine the trustworthiness of the encrypted key for example by the kernel of the operating system of the electronic device or by a relevant application in the operating system . The trusted keys may be stored in the memory of the electronic device . When the encrypted key matches any of the plurality of the stored trust keys the encrypted key may be determined to be trustworthy. The operating system or the application in environment supported by the operating system may transmit a notification or message to the server indicating that the electronic device is ready to be installed with a temporary trust enablement application after the encrypted key is determined to be trustworthy. The temporary trust enablement application may be installed on the electronic device by the server . For example the server may transmit a notification to the operating system to request the operating system or the application in the operating system to install the temporary trust enablement application. The temporary trust enablement application may be a software application and may be executed by the processor .

A trusted application may be transmitted by the server through an encrypted channel to the temporary trust enablement application on the electronic device . Access to at least part of the processor of the electronic device may be blocked for example to non trusted applications by the temporary trust enablement when the trusted application is executed. The trusted application may not execute continuously. Instead the trusted application may be executed every other predefined number of clock cycles of the electronic device . Thus the at least part of the processor may be blocked every other predefined number of clock cycles while the trusted application is executed. However some operating system interrupt routines may still interrupt the execution of the trusted application for example incoming phone rings. The trusted application may be restricted to a subset of APIs and hardware peripherals of the electronic device .

The temporary trust enablement application may block access to the at least part of the processor to non trusted applications while the trusted application is executed. Alternatively the kernel of the operating system may be utilized by the temporary trust enablement to block the at least part of the processor . The at least part of the processor that was blocked while the trusted application was executed may be released when the trusted application execution is completed. The trusted application the temporary trust enablement and the encrypted key may be removed when the trusted application execution is completed. When a second trusted application is about to be executed on the electronic device a second encrypted key may be generated by the server and transmitted to the electronic device for trustworthiness validation.

Turning now to a method is described. At block a provisioning status of a trusted security subzone on the electronic device is examined. For example provisioning statuses of trusted security subzones on the electronic device may be examined by the server . At block responsive to a trusted security subzone not being provisioned on the electronic device a temporary trust token is generated by a server. For example when a trusted security subzone is found to have not been provisioned on the electronic device a temporary trust token may be generated by the server for example by the server trusted security zone or a trusted application in the server trusted security zone . At block the temporary trust token is transmitted to the electronic device .

At block the temporary trust token is compared with a plurality of trust tokens stored in the electronic device to determine the trustworthiness of the temporary trust token. For example the temporary trust token may be compared with a plurality of stored trust tokens or trust keys to determine the trustworthiness of the temporary trust token. The stored trust keys may have been transmitted from the server to the electronic device before examining the provisioning status of trusted security subzones on the electronic device . For example when the user or owner of an electronic device travels to a building and desires access to the building a trusted application may be installed on the electronic device for the building access. Before the user of the electronic device arrives at the building the server may transmit at least one trust key to the electronic device . The trust key s from the server may be stored in non provisioned trusted security subzone s .

At block responsive to the temporary trust token being determined to be trustworthy the non provisioned trusted security subzone on the electronic device is provisioned to be a temporary trust enablement . At block the trusted application is transmitted through an encrypted channel to the temporary trust enablement . At block the trusted application is executed in the temporary trust enablement . At block the trusted application the temporary trust enablement and the temporary trust token are removed when the trusted application is completed.

Turning now to a method is described. At block a provisioning status of a trusted security subzone on the mobile communication device is examined. In the mobile communication device may be referred to as a mobile communication device . At block responsive to no trusted security zone hardware partition being found on the mobile communication device an encrypted key is generated by a server . At block the encrypted key is transmitted to the mobile communication device .

At block the temporary trust token is compared with a plurality of trust keys stored in the mobile communication device to determine the trustworthiness of the encrypted key. At block responsive to the encrypted key being determined to be trustworthy a temporary trust enablement application is installed on the mobile communication device .

At block the trusted application is restricted to a subset of application programming interfaces API and hardware peripherals of the mobile communication device . At block the at least part of the processor is released when the trusted application is completed. At block the trusted application the temporary trust enablement and the encrypted key are removed when the trusted application is completed.

The DSP or some other form of controller or central processing unit operates to control the various components of the mobile device in accordance with embedded software or firmware stored in memory or stored in memory contained within the DSP itself. In addition to the embedded software or firmware the DSP may execute other applications stored in the memory or made available via information carrier media such as portable data storage media like the removable memory card or via wired or wireless network communications. The application software may comprise a compiled set of machine readable instructions that configure the DSP to provide the desired functionality or the application software may be high level software instructions to be processed by an interpreter or compiler to indirectly configure the DSP .

The DSP may communicate with a wireless network via the analog baseband processing unit . In some embodiments the communication may provide Internet connectivity enabling a user to gain access to content on the Internet and to send and receive e mail or text messages. The input output interface interconnects the DSP and various memories and interfaces. The memory and the removable memory card may provide software and data to configure the operation of the DSP . Among the interfaces may be the USB port and the infrared port . The USB port may enable the mobile device to function as a peripheral device to exchange information with a personal computer or other computer system. The infrared port and other optional ports such as a Bluetooth interface or an IEEE 802.11 compliant wireless interface may enable the mobile device to communicate wirelessly with other nearby handsets and or wireless base stations. In an embodiment the device may comprise a near field communication NFC transceiver. The NFC transceiver may be used to complete payment transactions with point of sale terminals or other communications exchanges. In an embodiment the device may comprise a radio frequency identify RFID reader and or writer device.

The keypad couples to the DSP via the input output interface to provide one mechanism for the user to make selections enter information and otherwise provide input to the mobile device . Another input mechanism may be the touch screen LCD which may also display text and or graphics to the user. The touch screen LCD controller couples the DSP to the touch screen LCD . The GPS receiver is coupled to the DSP to decode global positioning system signals thereby enabling the mobile device to determine its position.

A trusted security zone provides chipsets with a hardware root of trust a secure execution environment for applications and secure access to peripherals. A hardware root of trust means the chipset should only execute programs intended by the device manufacturer or vendor and resists software and physical attacks and therefore remains trusted to provide the intended level of security. The chipset architecture is designed to promote a programmable environment that allows the confidentiality and integrity of assets to be protected from specific attacks. Trusted security zone capabilities are becoming features in both wireless and fixed hardware architecture designs. Providing the trusted security zone in the main mobile device chipset and protecting the hardware root of trust removes the need for separate secure hardware to authenticate the device or user. To ensure the integrity of the applications requiring trusted data such as a mobile financial services application the trusted security zone also provides the secure execution environment where only trusted applications can operate safe from attacks. Security is further promoted by restricting access of non trusted applications to peripherals such as data inputs and data outputs while a trusted application is running in the secure execution environment. In an embodiment the trusted security zone may be conceptualized as hardware assisted security.

A complete Trusted Execution Environment TEE may be implemented through the use of the trusted security zone hardware and software architecture. The Trusted Execution Environment is an execution environment that is parallel to the execution environment of the main mobile device operating system. The Trusted Execution Environment and or the trusted security zone may provide a base layer of functionality and or utilities for use of applications that may execute in the trusted security zone. For example in an embodiment trust tokens may be generated by the base layer of functionality and or utilities of the Trusted Execution Environment and or trusted security zone for use in trusted end to end communication links to document a continuity of trust of the communications. Through standardization of application programming interfaces APIs the Trusted Execution Environment becomes a place to which scalable deployment of secure services can be targeted. A device which has a chipset that has a Trusted Execution Environment on it may exist in a trusted services environment where devices in the trusted services environment are trusted and protected against attacks. The Trusted Execution Environment can be implemented on mobile phones and tablets as well as extending to other trusted devices such as personal computers servers sensors medical devices point of sale terminals industrial automation handheld terminals automotive etc.

The trusted security zone is implemented by partitioning all of the hardware and software resources of the mobile device into two partitions a secure partition and a normal partition. The secure partition may be implemented by a first physical processor and the normal partition may be implemented by a second physical processor. Alternatively the secure partition may be implemented by a first virtual processor and the normal partition may be implemented by a second virtual processor. Placing sensitive resources in the secure partition can protect against possible attacks on those resources. For example resources such as trusted software applications may run in the secure partition and have access to hardware peripherals such as a touchscreen or a secure location in memory. Less secure peripherals such as wireless radios may be disabled completely while the secure partition is being accessed while other peripherals may only be accessed from the secure partition. While the secure partition is being accessed through the Trusted Execution Environment the main mobile operating system in the normal partition is suspended and applications in the normal partition are prevented from accessing the secure peripherals and data. This prevents corrupted applications or malware applications from breaking the trust of the device.

The trusted security zone is implemented by partitioning the hardware and software resources to exist in a secure subsystem which is not accessible to components outside the secure subsystem. The trusted security zone is built into the processor architecture at the time of manufacture through hardware logic present in the trusted security zone which enables a perimeter boundary between the secure partition and the normal partition. The trusted security zone may only be manipulated by those with the proper credential and in an embodiment may not be added to the chip after it is manufactured. Software architecture to support the secure partition may be provided through a dedicated secure kernel running trusted applications. Trusted applications are independent secure applications which can be accessed by normal applications through an application programming interface in the Trusted Execution Environment on a chipset that utilizes the trusted security zone.

In an embodiment the normal partition applications run on a first virtual processor and the secure partition applications run on a second virtual processor. Both virtual processors may run on a single physical processor executing in a time sliced fashion removing the need for a dedicated physical security processor. Time sliced execution comprises switching contexts between the two virtual processors to share processor resources based on tightly controlled mechanisms such as secure software instructions or hardware exceptions. The context of the currently running virtual processor is saved the context of the virtual processor being switched to is restored and processing is restarted in the restored virtual processor. Time sliced execution protects the trusted security zone by stopping the execution of the normal partition while the secure partition is executing.

The two virtual processors context switch via a processor mode called monitor mode when changing the currently running virtual processor. The mechanisms by which the processor can enter monitor mode from the normal partition are tightly controlled. The entry to monitor mode can be triggered by software executing a dedicated instruction the Secure Monitor Call SMC instruction or by a subset of the hardware exception mechanisms such as hardware interrupts which can be configured to cause the processor to switch into monitor mode. The software that executes within monitor mode then saves the context of the running virtual processor and switches to the secure virtual processor.

The trusted security zone runs a separate operating system that is not accessible to the device users. For security purposes the trusted security zone is not open to users for installing applications which means users do not have access to install applications in the trusted security zone. This prevents corrupted applications or malware applications from executing powerful instructions reserved to the trusted security zone and thus preserves the trust of the device. The security of the system is achieved at least in part by partitioning the hardware and software resources of the mobile phone so they exist in one of two partitions the secure partition for the security subsystem and the normal partition for everything else. Placing the trusted security zone in the secure partition and restricting access from the normal partition protects against software and basic hardware attacks. Hardware logic ensures that no secure partition resources can be accessed by the normal partition components or applications. A dedicated secure partition operating system runs in a virtual processor separate from the normal partition operating system that likewise executes in its own virtual processor. Users may install applications on the mobile device which may execute in the normal partition operating system described above. The trusted security zone runs a separate operating system for the secure partition that is installed by the mobile device manufacturer or vendor and users are not able to install new applications in or alter the contents of the trusted security zone.

It is understood that by programming and or loading executable instructions onto the computer system at least one of the CPU the RAM and the ROM are changed transforming the computer system in part into a particular machine or apparatus having the novel functionality taught by the present disclosure. It is fundamental to the electrical engineering and software engineering arts that functionality that can be implemented by loading executable software into a computer can be converted to a hardware implementation by well known design rules. Decisions between implementing a concept in software versus hardware typically hinge on considerations of stability of the design and numbers of units to be produced rather than any issues involved in translating from the software domain to the hardware domain. Generally a design that is still subject to frequent change may be preferred to be implemented in software because re spinning a hardware implementation is more expensive than re spinning a software design. Generally a design that is stable that will be produced in large volume may be preferred to be implemented in hardware for example in an application specific integrated circuit ASIC because for large production runs the hardware implementation may be less expensive than the software implementation. Often a design may be developed and tested in a software form and later transformed by well known design rules to an equivalent hardware implementation in an application specific integrated circuit that hardwires the instructions of the software. In the same manner as a machine controlled by a new ASIC is a particular machine or apparatus likewise a computer that has been programmed and or loaded with executable instructions may be viewed as a particular machine or apparatus.

The secondary storage is typically comprised of one or more disk drives or tape drives and is used for non volatile storage of data and as an over flow data storage device if RAM is not large enough to hold all working data. Secondary storage may be used to store programs which are loaded into RAM when such programs are selected for execution. The ROM is used to store instructions and perhaps data which are read during program execution. ROM is a non volatile memory device which typically has a small memory capacity relative to the larger memory capacity of secondary storage . The RAM is used to store volatile data and perhaps to store instructions. Access to both ROM and RAM is typically faster than to secondary storage . The secondary storage the RAM and or the ROM may be referred to in some contexts as computer readable storage media and or non transitory computer readable media.

The network connectivity devices may take the form of modems modem banks Ethernet cards universal serial bus USB interface cards serial interfaces token ring cards fiber distributed data interface FDDI cards wireless local area network WLAN cards radio transceiver cards such as code division multiple access CDMA global system for mobile communications GSM long term evolution LTE worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX and or other air interface protocol radio transceiver cards and other well known network devices. These network connectivity devices may enable the processor to communicate with the Internet or one or more intranets. With such a network connection it is contemplated that the processor might receive information from the network or might output information to the network in the course of performing the above described method steps. Such information which is often represented as a sequence of instructions to be executed using processor may be received from and outputted to the network for example in the form of a computer data signal embodied in a carrier wave.

Such information which may include data or instructions to be executed using processor for example may be received from and outputted to the network for example in the form of a computer data baseband signal or signal embodied in a carrier wave. The baseband signal or signal embedded in the carrier wave or other types of signals currently used or hereafter developed may be generated according to several methods well known to one skilled in the art. The baseband signal and or signal embedded in the carrier wave may be referred to in some contexts as a transitory signal.

The processor executes instructions codes computer programs scripts which it accesses from hard disk floppy disk optical disk these various disk based systems may all be considered secondary storage ROM RAM or the network connectivity devices . While only one processor is shown multiple processors may be present. Thus while instructions may be discussed as executed by a processor the instructions may be executed simultaneously serially or otherwise executed by one or multiple processors. Instructions codes computer programs scripts and or data that may be accessed from the secondary storage for example hard drives floppy disks optical disks and or other device the ROM and or the RAM may be referred to in some contexts as non transitory instructions and or non transitory information.
