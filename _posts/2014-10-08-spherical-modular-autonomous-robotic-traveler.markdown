title: Spherical modular autonomous robotic traveler
abstract: A spherical modular autonomous robotic traveler (SMART) is provided for delivering a payload along a surface from a first position to a second position. The SMART includes an outer spherical shell for rolling along the surface, an inner spherical chamber within the outer shell to carry the payload, a plurality of weight-shifters arranged in the inner chamber, and a controller to activate a select weight-shifter among the plurality. The weight-shifters can be arranged symmetrically or asymmetrically. The outer shell rolls in a direction that corresponds to the activated weight-shifter by torque induced thereby. The inner chamber maintains its orientation relative to the surface, even while the outer shell rolls along the surface. Each weight-shifter includes a channel containing an armature and an electromagnet activated by the controller. For the symmetrical arrangement, the channel is oriented from bottom periphery to lateral radial periphery of the inner chamber. The electromagnet is disposed proximal to the channel at the lateral radial periphery. The armature travels from the bottom periphery within the channel to the lateral radial periphery upon activation of the electromagnet.

The invention is a Continuation in Part claims priority to and incorporates by reference in its entirety U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 263 529 filed Apr. 28 2014. That parent application is a Continuation of U.S. Pat. No. 8 768 548 which is a Continuation in Part of U.S. Pat. No. 7 963 350.

The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy and thus the invention herein may be manufactured used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates generally to autonomous robots. In particular the invention relates to spherical self propelled robots for autonomous remote delivery of an enclosed payload.

Autonomous robots have been developed for various purposes including self propelled machines designed for locomotion along horizontal and uneven surfaces. Additionally spherical platforms designed for ferrying persons into hostile close quarter areas for reconnaissance e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 7 963 350 and for remote control infrared sensing e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 8 768 548 have been conceptualized. These involve lower and upper internal carriages equipped with wheels that rotate along an outer shell of the platform to induce vehicle translation along an external surface.

Alternative ball shaped robots include U.S. Pat. No. 6 289 263 to Mukherjee and U.S. Pat. No. 8 322 471 to Schroll. The former concept provides a central hub with spokes extending radially therefrom and masses that shift along the spokes to shift the robot s moment of inertia for locomotion. The latter concept employs a pair of counter rotating gyroscopes to imparting momentum to a spherical housing.

Conventional autonomous robots yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular a spherical modular autonomous robotic traveler SMART is provided for delivering a payload to from a first location to a second location along a surface.

Various exemplary embodiments provide a SMART that includes an outer spherical shell for rolling along the surface an inner spherical chamber within the outer shell to carry the payload a plurality of weight shifters arranged in the inner chamber and a controller to activate a select weight shifter among the plurality. The outer shell rolls in a direction that corresponds to the activated weight shifter by torque induced thereby. The inner chamber maintains its orientation relative to the surface even while the outer shell rolls along the surface. The weight shifters can be arranged symmetrically or asymmetrically.

In other exemplary embodiments each weight shifter includes a channel containing an armature and an electromagnet activated by the controller. For a symmetrical SMART such as a cruciform configuration the channel is oriented from bottom periphery to lateral radial periphery of the inner chamber. The electromagnet is disposed proximal to the channel at the lateral radial periphery. The armature travels from the bottom periphery within the channel to the lateral radial periphery upon activation of the electromagnet.

Alternate embodiments provide an asymmetrical SMART that incorporate a peripheral weight shifter including a peripheral channel containing a first armature oriented from a forward periphery of the inner chamber toward a circumferential periphery of the inner chamber a radial weight shifter including a radial channel containing a second armature oriented from the forward periphery toward an interior location.

For the alternate embodiments the weight shifters further include first and second electromagnets activated by the controller respectively disposed adjacent the circumferential periphery and the interior location. The first armature travels from the forward periphery within the peripheral channel to the circumferential periphery upon activation of the first electromagnet and the second armature travels from the forward periphery within the radial channel to the interior location upon activation of the second electromagnet.

In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and logical mechanical and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.

In accordance with a presently preferred embodiment of the present invention the components process steps and or data structures may be implemented using various types of operating systems computing platforms computer programs and or general purpose machines. In addition those of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that devices of a less general purpose nature such as hardwired devices or the like may also be used without departing from the scope and spirit of the inventive concepts disclosed herewith. General purpose machines include devices that execute instruction code. A hardwired device may constitute an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or a field programmable gate array FPGA or other related component.

The disclosure generally employs metric units with the following abbreviations length in centimeters cm or meters m mass in grams g or kilograms kg time in seconds s angles in degrees or radians rad force in newtons N and current in amperes A . Supplemental measures can be expressed derived from these such as density in grams per cubic centimeters g cm moment of inertia in gram square centimeters kg m and the like.

U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 963 350 and 8 768 548 represent self locomotive spherical platforms that employ dual wheeled carriages mounted under and over the payload carriage contained within an outer spherical shell. The former reference includes description of personnel seated in tandem whereas this adjective should have been corrected to being abreast. Exemplary embodiments of the spherical modular autonomous robotic traveler SMART incorporate controlled shifts of the center of mass to minimize moving components and thereby enable miniaturization of such a self propelled device to approximately the size of a croquet ball that has a regulation diameter of 3 inches 9.2 cm . A billiard ball of 5.7 cm 2.244 inches for American pool could represent an alternative size for such purposes. The SMART can be designed with inertial momentum that is either neutral or biased depending on static preference of being either stationary or rolling. These alternatives are respectively labeled n SMART for neutral and b SMART for biased .

The lower module includes a plurality of weight shifting modules and a control assembly . The upper module includes a designated payload such as an incendiary explosive or flash bang charge equipped with a trigger within a housing . The outer shell rolls along a smooth frictional surface substantially perpendicular to the local gravitational field while the inner ball maintains an upright orientation relative to that field and thereby the surface during travel of the SMART .

Interface peripheries of the portions and can include rectangular cavities designed to receive complementary interlocking inserts and shown enlarged adjacently that can be sufficiently flexible to enable a tang of the male insert to be received by a clevis of the female insert to connect the halves and together. The inserts and can be secured within their respective cavities by adhesive bonding. At least one of the portions and includes an intake port shown as a short countersunk screw for inserting lubrication fluid such as oil into the spherical gap that forms the lubrication layer . Alternatively the intake port can incorporate a self sealing check valve.

Each weight shifter comprises a channel along which an armature for example a dense ball bearing can travel along the direction arrow and an electromagnet to pull the armature towards itself. The electromagnet can constitute fine copper wire that wraps around an iron ring core. Alternatively the weight shifter can employ a pulley attached to the armature and pulled upward and radially outward by a stepper motor rather than the electromagnet .

As the armature travels along arrow its weight induces a downward force . The n SMART has a center of mass which for a balanced inactive assembly lies along the vertical centerline . The force displaced relative to the center of mass produces a torque that causes the outer shell to roll forward along the arrow corresponding to the activated weight shifter . Each channel orients to diagonally rise from the bottom periphery near the centerline to the lateral radial interface periphery of the lower module at a tilt angle from vertical of approximately rad or 45 with the exemplary geometry being 42 in view .

The lower module can be closed cell polystyrene e.g. Styrofoam or an aerogel for containing the weight shifters and the control assembly . Upon assemblage the lower module can be inserted into the lower dome which would enable smooth interface with the interior of the outer shell . Alternatively the lower module and the lower dome can substantially form an integrated unit by three dimensional printing techniques to produce an encased honeycomb structure from thermoplastic filament for the cushioning interior to minimize weight while providing structural support of the weight shifters and other components. The volume of the lower module is further defined by its upper surface and a center cavity in which the payload can be inserted upon assemblage of the SMART .

The power supply provides electrical current for the processor and the electromagnets . Preferably the sensors constitute accelerometers to detect travel interruption in the direction of the activated weight shifter . Such a condition indicates presence of an obstacle hence to avoid the impediment to travel the processor can shift activation to an alternate electromagnet within the cruciform pattern . The order of shifts can be based on a pre selection sequence e.g. FAPS energizing durations random pattern or other criteria.

The channels can have tubular cross sections with corresponding spherical ball bearings as the armatures . Alternatively the armatures could be cylindrical roller bearings for sliding rather than rolling. At rest the armatures reside at the bottom of their respective channels adjacent the center of mass of the lower module . Upon activation the electromagnet pulls the corresponding armature radially outward and vertically upward towards the radial periphery thereby shifting the center of mass in the direction of the weight shifter that corresponds to the active electromagnet . Upon deactivation the armature falls through its channel returning to rest near the center of mass .

The armatures can preferably be composed of a dense material such as tungsten carbide WC density 15.63 g cm or alternatively depleted uranium metal U density 19.12 g cm with the armature plated with a ferromagnetic material such as cobalt or iron by which to engage the electromagnet when activated. For the exemplary sphere sizes considered the armature constitutes a WC ball bearing having a diameter of 0.7924 cm 0.312 inch thus having a volume of 0.26059 cmand corresponding mass of 4.073 g. The channel of each weight shifter would have a circular cross section of 0.8 cm diameter through which the armature could roll within from the base of the channel adjacent the center of mass to the electromagnet near the interface periphery when activated. Raising the WC ball against gravitation to its mass accelerated to 9.8 m s would require a force of F mg of 0.040 N.

Upon deployment the SMART can initiate rolling motion in response to a command signal to the receiver and or to a pre established clock event from the timer . Although initial and terminal commands can optionally be imposed on the SMART the processor enables autonomous locomotion via shifts in center of mass independently of external instructions. Guidance can be provided by internal travel vector calculations i.e. inertial guidance and or GPS receiver signals as to location relative to an intended target.

The processor can activate the electromagnet of a preselected or randomly assigned weight shifter such as among the FAPS in the cruciform pattern . The processor can be configured to preclude concurrent activation of multiple weight shifters . Alternatively the processor can be configured to enable near simultaneous activation and release of all of the weight shifters causing the SMART to jump upward slightly and thereby indicate kinematic arrival at its intended destination based on inertial navigation and or GPS identified location. This accelerometer signal could be augmented by supplemental location information or timing delays or multiple jumps within a stipulated interval to override false activation indicators such as descent along stair steps.

By attracting the armature to roll within the channel towards the electromagnet the center of mass of the inner ball and thus the SMART shifts away from the neutral mass center and in the direction of the activated weight shifter . Thereafter the processor can avoid obstacles by maneuvering with alternating weight shifters based on signals from the accelerometers among the sensors and terminate upon some established condition such as from the receiver and or the timer to cease locomotion. The receiver can alternatively receive information from the Global Positioning System GPS network to determine intended arrival. Alternatively the processor can operate based on pre programmed event scheduling based on the timer and negotiate a route to its destination by inertial navigation.

Alternating among the weight shifters via the selection switch enables the SMART to maneuver by change in direction inactivating the prior activated electromagnet to a subsequent electromagnet . The processor can also include a second .. gate connected to a single pole switch set to be open by default. The .. gate receives input signals from the receiver and or the timer in response to a condition such as designated arrival at the intended target and thereby closes the switch to activate all the electromagnets to initiate the jump.

The trigger can be activated by a power supply via signals from a receiver or a sensor . In particular the receiver can include a GPS location indicator or an activation command and the sensor can constitute an accelerometer oriented for vertical motion to detect the jump by the lower module . The housing can be supported by auxiliary suspension straps . The suspension components can be ribbons that extend through the cradle and secured in tension about the payload within the cavity upon assembly. The upper dome preferably enables a smooth interface with the interior of the outer shell to minimize friction between rolling and static components. Optionally the payload can be enveloped by polystyrene to restrict lateral movement within the upper module .

The lower dome presents an interface opening for receiving the lower module defined by a lower rim . Similarly the upper dome presents an interface opening for receiving the upper module defined by an upper rim . The upper dome structurally maintains the payload by fasteners such as straps that pass through holes along the top of and into depicted by dash lines the upper dome . In an exemplary embodiment the lower dome includes slots or holes to support the cradle .

As shown the lower dome includes a clevis fastener including a cantilever flange and a jaw that define a recess . A ledge provides an obstacle platform for the recess . The upper dome includes a tang fastener with a prong that wedges axially into the recess . The prong has a tip sufficiently flexible to pass between the flange and the jaw into the recess along the arrow direction and includes a terminal lip that upon insertion into the recess abuts the ledge to inhibit removal. The clevis and tang fasteners and present complementary snap together counterparts with their respective recess and prong for securing the domes and to each other.

The domes and can be fabricated from an appropriate rigid material such as a ceramic e.g. magnesium fluoride MgF density 3.148 g cm metal alloy e.g. aluminum 6061 density 2.70 g cm or thermoset plastic e.g. polyethylene terephthalate CHO also known as polyester density 1.38 g cm . For inner ball components stamped from sheet metal providing inclusion of transmission windows to permit radio signals to enter the clevis and tang fasteners and can be secured to their respective domes and by attachment mechanisms such as shallow countersunk screws . Alternatively the fasteners and can be incorporated directly in fabrication such as by injection molding. In other exemplary embodiments the snap fasteners can be oriented angularly so that the prong inserts into the recess and rotated to lock the mechanism assembly.

Complementary fasteners and can be angularly distributed along the respective interior surface of the rims and while avoiding interference from their radially inward protrusion to the weight shifters . The arrangement of the fasteners and can be uniformly designated for respective domes and or in alternation by complementary pairs along each rim for mutual alignment. Depending on whether the fasteners and have flanking walls on one or both sides of the recess the domes and can be permitted to be rotated relative to each other to release them or precluded from such an option.

For a croquet size device the outer shell has an outer radius of 4.6 cm. Assuming a thickness of 0.12 cm the inner radius would be 4.48 cm for a total material volume of 31.1 cm. Composed of polyester the outer shell would have a mass of 42.9 g and a thin sphere moment of inertia of I m R where m is mass and R is average radius to yield 5.90E 5 kg m. An exemplary inner ball could have respective outer and inner radii of 4.43 cm and 4.30 cm for a total material volume of 28.7 cm. Composed of polyester the inner ball would have a mass of 39.6 g and a moment of inertia of 5.03E 5 kg m. Assuming a cylindrical explosive with a radius of 2.0 cm and height of 2.0 cm the payload has a volume of 25.1 cm. Using HMX for an explosive with a density of 1.91 g cm the mass of the payload can be estimated at 48.0 g.

Using the 4.073 g WC ball bearing as the armature requires a lifting force of 0.040 N. Electromagnetic force can be quantified by the solenoid relation F N i A 2L where N is number of wire turns around the core i is the current 47E 7 N A is permeability A is cross section area and L is length gap between the armature and the electromagnet . For purposes of exemplary embodiments current is taken as 3.6 A supplied by six 9 V batteries arranged in parallel for the power supply and length gap is 5 cm 0.05 m . A typical 9 V battery has a mass of 45 g.

For 500 turns using 36 gauge wire rated at 4 A winding 78.7 turns per centimeter the exemplary electromagnet would have a core perimeter of 6.353 cm which can be converted to a toroidal coil of 2.02 cm for inner diameter. The cross section area can be estimated at 0.5 cm 5E 5 m based on a core diameter of 0.8 cm. The inner core dimension together with the cross section indicates the core radius of 1.42 cm for view . This yields solenoid force of F 0.041 N adequate to elevate the armature . Alternatively a cascade of electromagnets could be disposed along the length of the channel with successive electromagnets raising the armature sequentially. Such design would entail additional control logic by the processor to avoid excess drain on the power supply .

The exemplary electromagnets would have an approximate mass of 25 g each and provide a moment of inertia estimated at 6.0E 5 kg m. At rest the armatures would have a negligible moment being disposed near the center of mass . The payload 48 g and batteries 270 g plus other components can be estimated as having a mass of 500 g distributed about 2 cm in radius and along a height of about 3 cm with a corresponding cylindrical moment of 8.7E 5 kg m. Total moment of the SMART can thus be estimated based on the outer shell the inner ball and internal components as about 2.6E 4 kg m.

A single activated armature would induce a moment of about 70 g cm 7.0E 6 kg m . The torque produced by the internal mass shift within the lower module can be expressed as T L F sin I where L is travel length along the channel F is the force applied by the armature upon activation of the electromagnet is the tilt angle I is total moment of inertia and is angular acceleration.

For the exemplary n SMART configuration force constitutes armature mass of 0.004 kg multiplied by gravitational acceleration of 9.8 m syielding 0.04 N as described earlier for raising the armature length is about 5 cm and tilt angle is about 42 . This produces a torque of 1.3E 3 N m. With total moment estimated to be 2.6E 4 kg m this yields an angular acceleration of about 5 rad s.

Continuous acceleration for 2.0 s yields an instantaneous radial speed of 10 rad s or 1.59 revolutions per second. With a diameter of 9.2 cm the outer shell has a circumference of 28.9 cm and thus within two seconds could travel 0.23 m at a speed of 0.46 m s. Assuming continuous acceleration were achievable with an available power supply the SMART could reach highway travel speed of 100 km hr 27.7 m s within 35 s on a smooth surface.

The cases and contain an inner ball that includes weight shifter assemblies. These include flanking lateral channels and a radial channel in which armatures roll and electromagnets at the distal ends of the channels and . The armatures can constitute WC ball bearings and the electromagnets can be substantially similar to their n SMART counterparts albeit with potentially distinctive physical characteristics and performance.

The channels and have substantially circular cross sections as their n SMART counterpart . The weight shifting assemblies are contained within a lower module and the payload trigger and housing are contained in an upper module . A control assembly can be contained within the lower module . The modules and can be combined with their respective cases and composed of thermoplastic with honeycomb interior by three dimensional printing techniques.

The lateral channels extend from their bases to the starboard and port sides along travel lines with the armatures moving along direction arrow oriented upward from a mid latitude arc by a slope angle of about 10 . The bases of the channels and join at an intersection along the mid latitude arc and a forward longitude adjacent the periphery of the lower case upon assembly .

The armatures at the base of the channels bias the assembly s center of mass forward from the vertical centerline . The starboard and port channels terminate adjacent a radial periphery of the lower module . The electromagnets are disposed proximate to an interface surface of the lower module . Activation of either the starboard or port electromagnet causes the most proximate armature towards its corresponding side to respectively initiate a right or left turn. The control assembly for the b SMART provides similar actuation initiation for the electromagnets as well as navigation commands as described for the control assembly for the n SMART .

By contrast activation of the center electromagnet reduces distance between the center of mass from the centerline via individually rolling the armatures through the radial channel and into the cavity for repository. Whereas the n SMART employs weight shifters in cruciform configuration the peripherally extending channels define operation of the b SMART .

For the alternate b SMART configuration the three armatures produce a moment of about 200 g cm 2.0E 6 kg m while the electromagnets remain inert. For triple armature mass of 0.012 kg yields a force of 0.12 N over a radial length of about 3.5 cm from the centerline yielding a torque of about 4.2E 3 N m. The same assembly moment of about 2.6E 4 kg mresults in an angular acceleration of about 16 rad s thereby enabling higher acceleration albeit with reduced ability to remain stationary.

While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein many modifications substitutions changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. The afore described dimensions and mass properties constitute an example to demonstrate a practical utility and are not limiting. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments.
