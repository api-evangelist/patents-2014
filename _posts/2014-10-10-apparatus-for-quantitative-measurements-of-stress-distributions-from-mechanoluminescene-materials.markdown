This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 889 090 filed on Oct. 10 2013 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention generally relates to an apparatus for measuring the mechanoluminescence of a mechanoluminescent material. The present invention further relates to an apparatus that measures the quantitative stress or strain distributions of a mechanoluminescent material using mechanoluminescence light intensity. The present invention further relates to an apparatus having a mechanoluminescent material within a chamber where the apparatus photoexcites the mechanoluminescent material takes images of the mechanoluminescent material and monitors environmental conditions within the chamber.

It is previously known to use mechanoluminescence ML materials for the visualization of stress or crack distributions through the use of mechanically induced light emission. These ML materials can be applied to a structure for monitoring the health of the structure. Monitoring is performed by sensors capable of measuring deformations of and stresses on the structures. Such known sensors can utilize strain gauges photoelasticity and digital image correlation for measuring the stress experienced by a structure. A goal of these sensors is the diagnosis of impending structural failure which can lead to the subsequent correction of the structural failure mechanisms.

Existing applications of using sensors for monitoring ML materials are limited. For instance strain gauges are generally limited to point by point measurements. Also existing sensors are generally not capable of revealing full field visualization of stresses.
