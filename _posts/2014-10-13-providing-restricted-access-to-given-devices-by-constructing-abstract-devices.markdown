Embodiments of the invention generally relate to information technology and more particularly to device access control techniques.

Commonly in a home business and or recreational setting there are numerous user devices present each carrying out or attempting to carry out one or more actions. Additionally there are often multiple users who are to be provided different levels of access to such user devices. Further it may be desirable to provide restricted access to a given combinations of devices rather than to individual devices. For example it may be desired to allow an individual to set the temperature of a given room only within a certain temperature range and without giving the individual access to the individual fans and or air conditioning units in the given room.

Also it may be desirable to provide restricted device access to a given individual and or set of individuals. For example consider a hospital room setting wherein multiple devices are present for measuring patient information. Additionally the hospital room may include controls to adjust room temperature lighting bed position etc. and a patient may also bring his or her own devices that need to be accessible to doctors and or nurses.

However existing role based access control RBAC approaches do not provide capabilities to manage a setting wherein a given individual or set of individuals need to be afforded opportunistic access because the set of resources and users in the system continues to change. Accordingly a need exists for techniques that provide an abstract virtual device with abstract controls to provide the level of access that is intended and or desired for a given setting.

In one aspect of the present invention techniques for providing restricted access to given devices by constructing abstract devices are provided. An exemplary computer implemented method can include steps of generating a virtual device based on one or more physical devices mapping multiple device actions of the one or more physical devices to multiple device actions of the virtual device exposed by the virtual device incorporating i discretionary access control techniques ii policy based access control techniques and iii a physical device level partial ordering of actions to determine a resolution in response to a set of multiple user access requests for two or more of the multiple device actions of the virtual device and executing the two or more device actions of the virtual device on the virtual device for one or more given users in accordance with said resolution by coordinating the execution of two or more corresponding device actions of the one or more physical devices on the one or more physical devices based on said mapping.

In another aspect of the invention an exemplary computer implemented method can include steps of generating a virtual device based on one or more of multiple physical devices mapping multiple device actions of the one or more physical devices to multiple device actions of the virtual device exposed by the virtual device and receiving multiple access requests to two or more of the multiple device actions of the virtual device from multiple users and or two or more of the multiple physical devices. The method also includes steps of decomposing each of the multiple access requests to a set of physical device level access requests forwarding each physical device level access request to one or more corresponding physical devices among the multiple physical devices collating each individual physical device level access decision in response to each physical device level access request and executing in accordance with said collating the two or more device actions of the virtual device on the virtual device by coordinating the execution of two or more corresponding device actions of the one or more physical devices on the one or more physical devices based on said mapping.

Another aspect of the invention or elements thereof can be implemented in the form of an article of manufacture tangibly embodying computer readable instructions which when implemented cause a computer to carry out a plurality of method steps as described herein. Furthermore another aspect of the invention or elements thereof can be implemented in the form of an apparatus including a memory and at least one processor that is coupled to the memory and configured to perform noted method steps. Yet further another aspect of the invention or elements thereof can be implemented in the form of means for carrying out the method steps described herein or elements thereof the means can include hardware module s or a combination of hardware and software modules wherein the software modules are stored in a tangible computer readable storage medium or multiple such media .

These and other objects features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments thereof which is to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings.

As described herein an aspect of the present invention includes techniques for providing restricted access to devices by generating abstract devices and actions. At least one embodiment of the invention includes generating and or providing an abstract that is virtual device with abstract controls to provide the level of access that is intended and or desired for a given setting. Such an abstract device and related controls can carry out individual actions on one or more component devices in accordance with a set of one or more access rules.

As additionally described herein at least one embodiment of the invention includes utilizing a combination of discretionary access control DAC policy based access control PBAC and device level partial ordering of services to grant or deny access requests to abstract device services. Further one or more embodiments of the invention include utilizing a broker based system for decomposing and forwarding component device level access requests and collating individual level access decisions to execute abstract actions.

By way of illustration an example embodiment of the invention can include providing authorization s for device compositions across a set of devices D D D. . . D and a set of known users U U U. . . U. In such an example embodiment for each D the set of device services is S S S. . . S. As such a virtual device service composed of two devices Dand D offering a composite service S can be composed as follows DDS DS DS and Eval DDS U Eval DS U and Eval DS U . Here is the composition operator and Eval . is a function that evaluates whether the user Ucan access the requested service S virtual or physical device level . The Eval function combines DAC PBAC and device level service ordering to determine if a user should be provided access to a service as further described below.

As noted herein at least one embodiment of the invention includes combining rules and or policies and DAC techniques for device access control. In carrying out DAC based authorization resolution for each device D the user specifies a DAC table which authorizes and denies principals users for specific device services. Additionally policy based authorization resolution can be carried out for example as follows Allow DS U Role Friend U and GeoFence U Circle 50 feet which allows unknown users to request and be granted access under certain circumstances. Here Allow . is a predicate that returns a true or false status based on whether Uis allowed access or not. The above rule states that a user Uis allowed access if Uis a friend that is is on a given list of friends indicated by the true false predicate function Role . . AND if Uis within 50 feet of the device. GeoFence . is a predicate which indicates whether a user is within a particular distance of the device or not and Circle . is a function an instance of which evaluates an area based on the radius specified.

Also partial ordering of services based access resolution can include implementing a per device partial ordering such as for example S

As such in accordance with the example embodiment of the invention depicted in the centralized message broker acts as a coordinator for access request mediation among users and and devices and . All access requests for a composite service are forwarded from user and or user to the message broker . The message broker decomposes each service request forwards each request to device and or device for a local service access determination with the relevant and or corresponding device . Additionally the message broker combines access decisions from device and device and evaluates access to a composite service. Combining access decisions includes collating access control decisions from individual devices and evaluating includes determining the particular access to provide depending upon the collected access control decisions. If all device level access control decisions return true access is provided to the requesting user.

Device level compositions commonly involve devices owned by the same user or devices owned by other users who participate in the composition for mutual benefit among the users. However other settings can differ in that even users with no participating devices can request access to the composed device. This can be found for example in machine to machine M2M environments wherein the number of devices are often many and their possible combinations are potentially exponential. Such a setting precludes statically authoring access control rules for all possible combinations.

Accordingly at least one embodiment of the invention includes combining DAC PBAC and device level partial orderings as well as mediating access requests to an abstract service and executing the access requests on one or more given component devices. By way of illustration when two M2M devices come together to form an abstract device the security policy for the new joint abstract device is to be determined at run time. For example consider a scenario wherein a first user owns a television and a second user owns a Bluetooth or infrared IR enabled phone while the second user is not permitted to change the channel on the television using Bluetooth IR.

In such an example conflict resolution can include considerations of priority and semantics to determine an overriding policy when two or more policies overlap. Additionally such considerations can be made on the basis of the given action s as well as on the basis of the given user s . As detailed herein at least one embodiment of the invention can also include implementing a partial order on actions.

Continuing with the above example the given actions can be considered as follows a fundamental action includes changing the channel on the television while an extended and or modified action includes changing the channel on the television using Bluetooth or infrared. Additionally in this example consider Aas representing a series of entertainment actions and Bas representing a series of actions pertaining to networking. As such an example embodiment of the invention can include making the following determination A B. A priority determination is exemplified below and can be for example user provided based on a perceived sensitivity of given resources.

Accordingly an example embodiment of the invention in connection with the example scenario as detailed above in connection with includes creating and or providing an abstract virtual device such as AD with abstract switches controls to provide the level of access that is intended and or desired for each of one or more individuals. The abstract device carries out the individual actions on the component devices via UI UI and UI in accordance with a set of one or more access rules. A rule engine resident in the abstract device for example generates such access rules based on the rules provided. For example a user can provide one or more rules for the devices owned by that user.

Accordingly at least one embodiment of the invention includes providing granularity of access control wherein multiple types of access can be provided from the same combination of devices to multiple users by creating multiple abstractions. Additionally one or more embodiments of the invention include enabling support for multiple models wherein for instance different individuals may want or require different abstractions for a given set of devices. Multiple model support can be implemented via the access rules specified by the user which determines the abstract device that is created. Additionally it is assumed in one or more embodiments of the invention that each user generates only one set of access rules for his or her devices.

As detailed herein access control scenarios encompassed by one or more embodiments of the invention can include real actions and abstract actions. Real actions include actual device capability such as for example turning a device on or off increasing or decreasing volume on a specific device etc. Abstract actions include actions composed from one or more real actions on one or more devices. A typical example can include a volume decrease which can refer to decreasing the volume of a radio and or television. In at least one embodiment of the invention only abstract actions are exposed to external users.

Further one or more embodiments of the invention include rule based abstract access which can include utilization of one or more human specified rules. Such human specified rules can take the form for example of AB. Here A is referred to as the antecedent or the precedent and B is referred to as the consequent of the rule. One type of rule implemented by at least one embodiment of the invention includes a rule in which all antecedents and consequents are real actions. For example such a rule might include the following TV.onRadio.off and Light.Dimmed With such a rule the precedent of the rule is exposed as an abstract action.

A second type of rule implemented by at least one embodiment of the invention includes a rule in which an antecedent or a consequent contains a virtual action. A virtual action as noted above is an action that is not directly tied to a specific device capability. For example such a rule might include the following TurnOffAllEntertainmentTV.off and Radio.off. With this example rule TurnOffAllEntertainmentis a virtual action introduced by the user. Virtual actions can also be exposed as abstract actions as well.

The access control matrix component maintains a mapping between the various users such as users and and the abstract actions such as those identified in repository to which each given user or user role has access. For example a user can generate the mapping by authoring the DAC table and PBAC rules. Additionally devices such as devices and can include adapters which enable communication between the devices and one or more actions.

Access control provided in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention can result in an increased number and range of parameters over which access control may be based for example device battery level communication link capability etc. . Also access control can be used for personalized or role based quality of service QoS implementations. For example one way to ensure QoS is to incorporate available battery level of devices in access control decisions and provide access only if the battery level is above a user specified threshold. Further at least one embodiment of the invention includes incorporating one or more social networking aspects. For example devices of friends can join or become associated and provide abstract interfaces.

Step includes mapping multiple device actions of the one or more physical devices to multiple device actions of the virtual device exposed by the virtual device. Each of the multiple device actions of the one or more physical devices includes a capability associated with a given physical device while each of the multiple device actions of the virtual device includes an action derived from one or more device actions of the one or more physical devices that is applicable to one or more of the physical devices.

Step includes incorporating i discretionary access control techniques ii policy based access control techniques and iii a physical device level partial ordering of actions to determine a resolution in response to a set of multiple user access requests for two or more of the multiple device actions of the virtual device. The multiple user access requests can be provided by a single user or by multiple distinct users.

Step includes executing the two or more device actions of the virtual device on the virtual device for one or more given users in accordance with said resolution by coordinating the execution of two or more corresponding device actions of the one or more physical devices on the one or more physical devices based on said mapping. In at least one embodiment of the invention the one or more given users are not known a priori.

The techniques depicted in can also include specifying one or more rules associated with each of the multiple device actions of the virtual device as well as specifying a role associated with each of the one or more given users. Accordingly such an embodiment of the invention can include incorporating i discretionary access control techniques ii policy based access control techniques iii a physical device level partial ordering of actions and iv the role associated with each of the one or more given users to determine a resolution in response to the set of multiple user access requests for the two or more of the multiple device actions of the virtual device. Further at least one embodiment of the invention can include generating an access control matrix for mapping said role associated with each of the one or more given users and each of the multiple device actions of the virtual device to which each role has access.

Additionally the techniques depicted in can include incorporating i discretionary access control techniques ii policy based access control techniques iii a physical device level partial ordering of actions and iv one or more context attributes to determine a resolution in response to the set of multiple user access requests for the two or more of the multiple device actions of the virtual device. The context attributes can include battery level of the one or more physical devices and or communication link capability of the one or more physical devices. Additionally the context attributes can include user location and or one or more social networking connections associated with the one or more given users.

As also detailed herein at least one embodiment of the invention can include an example method including steps of generating a virtual device based on one or more of multiple physical devices mapping multiple device actions of the one or more physical devices to multiple device actions of the virtual device exposed by the virtual device and receiving multiple access requests to two or more of the multiple device actions of the virtual device from multiple users and or two or more of the multiple physical devices. The example method also includes steps of decomposing each of the multiple access requests to a physical device level access request forwarding each physical device level access request to one or more corresponding physical devices among the multiple physical devices collating each individual physical device level access decision in response to each physical device level access request and executing in accordance with said collating the two or more device actions of the virtual device on the virtual device by coordinating the execution of two or more corresponding device actions of the one or more physical devices on the one or more physical devices based on said mapping.
