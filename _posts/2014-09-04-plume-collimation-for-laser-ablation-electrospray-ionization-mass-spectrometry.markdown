This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 13 549 988 filed on Jul. 16 2012 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 507 836 filed on Jul. 14 2011. Each of the foregoing applications is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This invention was made with Government support under Grant No. 0719232 awarded by the National Science Foundation and Grant No. DEFG02 01ER15129 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy. The government has certain rights in the invention

The apparatuses and methods described herein generally relate to ionization sources for mass spectrometers and methods of mass spectrometry and in particular laser ablation electrospray ionization LAESI mass spectrometry MS as well as methods of making and using the same.

Mass spectrometry is an analytical technique that has been successfully used in chemistry biology medicine and other fields for qualitative and quantitative analysis. The analysis of a single cell and or subcellular component by conventional methods of mass spectrometry typically requires extensive sample preparation which may alter the molecular composition of the system. For example matrix assisted laser desorption ionization MALDI combined with laser capture microdissection may suffer from time consuming and complex sample preparation e.g. to freeze or fix the sample which may cause perturbations to the biological sample. MALDI also utilizes a matrix that may interfere with the analysis of single cells and subcellular components. Live video mass spectrometry and direct organelle mass spectrometry use organic solvents that may also interfere with the analysis of single cells and subcellular components. Mass spectrometry may be combined with conventional separation techniques such as capillary electrophoresis however these techniques may increase analysis time complexity and or cost.

Accordingly more efficient and or cost effective mass spectrometry devices and methods of making and using the same are desirable.

This disclosure describes various features aspects and advantages of various embodiments of ionization sources for mass spectrometers and methods for making and using the same. It is understood however that this disclosure embraces numerous alternative embodiments that may be accomplished by combining any of the various features aspects and advantages of the various embodiments described herein in any combination or sub combination that one of ordinary skill in the art may find useful.

Further Applicants reserve the right to amend the claims to affirmatively disclaim any features or aspects that may be present in the prior art. The various embodiments disclosed and described in this disclosure may comprise consist of or consist essentially of the features and aspects as variously described herein.

According to certain embodiments more efficient and or cost effective mass spectrometry devices and methods of making and using the same are described.

Metabolism generally refers to chemical processes of a living cell or organism that support and maintain life. The products of these chemical processes may be generally referred to as metabolites. The metabolites and distribution of metabolites in a cell or tissue may change depending on its function biological state developmental stage history and or environment. Identification and analysis of metabolites and metabolite distributions may facilitate a better understanding of cell function. Certain embodiments may be used to analyze cellular heterogeneity and provide insight into the cell to cell variations of metabolic pathways affected by diseases.

Mass spectrometric analysis of subcellular components single cells and or groups of cells may be limited by small sample volumes and or inefficient ion production. A small sample volume may coexist with a low concentration of subcellular components in a single cell or group of cells. Some conventional techniques to isolate single cells and or groups of cells may cause sampling related perturbations that disrupt metabolite distributions within the sample. Therefore mass spectrometry devices and methods of using the same having improved ion efficiency and or sensitivity and or limits of detection are desirable.

Some mass spectrometry techniques may comprise a freely expanding ablation plume such as a hemispherical laser ablation plume illustrated in characterized by low ionization efficiency and or low sensitivity and or low limits of detection. A freely expanding ablation plume in the ambient environment may be generated for example when mid infrared laser pulses at a wavelength of about 2.94 m and a pulse length of about 5 nanoseconds are emitted at a sample comprising water. The absorption of the laser energy by the water may initiate surface evaporation shock wave emission and or ejection of droplets via phase explosion. The surface evaporation may initiate relatively slow plume expansion that after about 300 ns induces a propagation of shock waves which may not be very efficient. However at the spinodal limit i.e. when the sample is superheated to about its critical temperature a rapidly expanding vapor plume droplets and or particulates may be ejected. Without wishing to be bound to any particular theory it is believed that the spinodal limit may be achieved when the volumetric energy density F where F is the laser fluence and is the absorption coefficient is greater than about 1 kJ cmor when the laser energy increases the temperature of the liquid to about 80 of its critical temperature. After about 1 s the phase explosion may induce recoil pressure that generates an efficient secondary material ejection process.

According to certain embodiments mass spectrometry devices and methods of making and using the same may be characterized by improved ionization efficiency and or improved sensitivity and or improved limits of detection relative to a freely expanding ablation plume. As described herein laser ablation may be used to eject a small volume from a sample in a collimated ablation plume to improve ion production and thereby ionization efficiency and or limits of detection. In various embodiments mass spectrometry devices and methods of making and using the same may comprise direct mass spectrometry devices and methods of making and using the same for in vivo analysis of small cell populations single cells and or subcellular components. In various embodiments a biological sample may be analyzed in a native environment with minimal and or no sample preparation.

In various embodiments mass spectrometry devices may comprise a capillary or hollow waveguide to select a sample for ablation and or collimate the ablation plume. For example a capillary may be inserted into an aqueous droplet comprising cells to select one or more cells for ablation. The cell may be drawn into the capillary by capillary forces. The mass spectrometry device may comprise ablation in transmission geometry. As shown in a capillary may collimate an ablation plume generated in the capillary. In various embodiments the ablation plume may comprise a collimated ablation plume. The collimated ablation plume may comprise a radially confined ablation plume. The collimated ablation plume may comprise a collinear ablation plume. The capillary may reduce and or eliminate the radial expansion of the ablation plume. The collimated ablation plume may be ejected from the capillary. The collimated ablation plume may generate a more efficient ionization process.

A collimated ablation plume in the ambient environment may be generated for example when mid infrared laser pulses at a wavelength of about 2.94 m and a pulse length of about 5 nanoseconds are emitted at a sample comprising water within a capillary. The radial expansion of the ablation plume may be reduced and or eliminated by the capillary. Without wishing to be bound to any particular theory the collimated ablation plume may exhibit different photomechanical effects plume dynamics and or kinetics relative to the freely expanding ablation plume. For example the collimated ablation plume may achieve greater pressures and or greater temperatures than the freely expanding ablation plume. Further when an optical fiber is used to couple the laser energy to the sample the optical fiber tip may generate acoustic radiation that causes greater tensile stress in the water and may generate explosive vaporization of the water cavitation of the water and or bubble formation. The collapse of the generated bubble may generate the ejection of the ablation plume in a high speed liquid jet. The capillary may generate more efficient plume collimation and acceleration. The radial confinement of the ablation plume in the capillary may generate increased pressures in the capillary resulting in forward directed propulsion of a collimated ablation plume. The collimated ablation plume may improve ion formation and or ion efficiency.

Certain embodiments of the LAESI ionization sources for mass spectrometers and methods of making and using the same described herein may provide certain advantages over other approaches of mass spectrometric analysis. The advantages may include one or more of but are not limited to in situ analysis in situ single cell analysis in situ subcellular analysis in vivo analysis in vivo single cell analysis in vivo subcellular analysis simultaneous detection of multiple components in samples independent optimization of ablation conditions and ionization conditions a wider dynamic range of samples that may be used quantitative analysis semi quantitative analysis operation under ambient conditions simpler sample preparation minimal sample manipulation minimal sample degradation direct analysis of tissues and cells analysis of large samples two dimensional mass spectrometric imaging at atmospheric pressure three dimensional mass spectrometric imaging at atmospheric pressure the ability to monitor environmental effects or external stimuli on multiple cells single cells or subcellular components the ability to monitor the effects of xenobiotics for example pharmaceuticals drug candidates toxins environmental pollutants and or nanoparticles the ability to couple with a flow cytometry system higher throughput improved sampling time positional sensitivity improved sensitivity improved sensitivity to surface properties improved ionization improved ionization efficiency and improved detection limits.
