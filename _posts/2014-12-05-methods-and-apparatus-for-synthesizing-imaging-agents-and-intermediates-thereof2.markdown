The present invention relates to systems compositions methods and apparatuses for synthesizing imaging agents and precursors thereof.

Mitochondria are membrane enclosed organelles distributed through the cytosol of most eukaryotic cells. Mitochondria are especially concentrated in myocardial tissue.

Complex 1 MC 1 is a membrane bound protein complex of 46 dissimilar subunits. This enzyme complex is one of three energy transducing complexes that constitute the respiratory chain in mammalian mitochondria. This NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase is the point of entry for the majority of electrons that traverse the respiratory chain eventually resulting in the reduction of oxygen to water 1992 25 253 324 . Examples of inhibitors of MC 1 include deguelin piericidin A ubicidin 3 rolliniastatin 1 rolliniastatin 2 bullatacin capsaicin pyridaben fenpyroximate amytal MPP quinolines and quinolones 1998 1364 222 235 . Studies have shown that interrupting the normal function of mitochondria could advantageously concentrate certain compounds in the mitochondria and hence in the mitochondria rich myocardial tissue. Compounds that include an imaging moiety e.g. F can be useful in determining such a build up of compounds thereby providing valuable diagnostic markers for myocardial perfusion imaging. In addition such compounds may find application for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease CAD .

CAD is a major cause of death in modern industrialized countries and it has been found previously that assessments of regional myocardial perfusion at rest and during stress exercise or pharmacologic coronary vasodilation are valuable for noninvasive diagnosis of CAD. While myocardial perfusion imaging MPI with Positron Emission Tomography PET has been shown to be superior in some embodiments as compared to single photon emission computed tomography SPECT widespread clinical use of PET MPI has been limited by the previously available PET myocardial perfusion tracers.

Several PET blood flow tracers such as rubidium 82 Rb chloride nitrogen 13 N ammonia and oxygen 15 O water have been developed and validated for assessment of myocardial perfusion. N and O are cyclotron produced isotopes with short half lives. Therefore their use is limited to facilities with an on site cyclotron. Although Rb is a generator produced tracer its short half life the high cost of the generator and the inability to perform studies in conjunction with treadmill exercise have made this tracer impractical for widespread use. Tracers that comprise F have however found potential application as imaging agents.

While current methods for preparing compounds comprising an imaging moiety include F fluorination chemistry many methods focus on nucleophilic F fluorination chemistry using potassium fluoride KF . Characteristically these methods generate the elemental fluoride source through anion exchange between for example potassium carbonate KCO and a cyclotron produced F containing species and often require addition of the aza crown ether Kryptofix 222 4 7 13 16 21 24 hexaoxa 1 10 diazabicyclo 8.8.8 hexacosane to enhance reactivity. While suitable for production of clinical quantities the moderate efficiency demanding purification and complex implementation of such method may not be suitable for widespread commercial application.

The present invention generally relates to systems compositions cassettes methods and apparatuses for the synthesis of imaging agents and precursors thereof. In some aspects the invention relates to imaging agents synthesized using methods described herein.

In some embodiments the present invention relates to methods for synthesizing an imaging agent for example by reacting an imaging agent precursor with a source of an imaging moiety. As described herein in some cases the method involves the use of one or more additives e.g. salts that may facilitate a chemical reaction. The methods may exhibit improved yields and may allow for the widespread synthesis of imaging agents including imaging agents comprising a radioisotope e.g. F . The imaging agents may be useful as sensors diagnostic tools and the like. Synthetic methods for preparing an imaging agent have also been designed to use an automated synthesis system to prepare and purify imaging agents that comprise a radioisotope. In some aspects the invention allows radiolabeled imaging agents to be made using a nucleophilic reaction system including but not limited to the Explora GN or RN synthesis system Siemens Medical Solutions USA Inc. GE Tracerlab MX synthesis system GE Healthcare Eckert Zeigler Modular Lab Synthesis system etc. which are commonly available at PET manufacturing facilities PMF .

In some embodiments the present invention provides methods for synthesizing an imaging agent precursor wherein the imaging agent precursor is reacted with a source of an imaging moiety to form the imaging agent. As will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art it is advantageous to utilize methods which involve high yielding reactions and a relatively low number of synthetic and or purification steps. Accordingly many of the methods provided herein for synthesizing an imaging agent precursor provide the imaging agent precursor in fewer steps than previously reported with greater ease of synthesis and or at a higher yield.

In some embodiments the present invention provides methods of imaging including methods of imaging in a subject that includes administering a composition or formulation e.g. that comprises imaging agent 1 as described herein to the subject by injection infusion or any method of administration and imaging a region of the subject that is of interest. Regions of interest may include but are not limited to the heart cardiovascular system cardiac vessels blood vessels e.g. arteries veins brain and other organs. A parameter of interest such as blood flow cardiac wall motion or perfusion can be imaged and detected using methods and or systems of the invention. In some cases methods for evaluating perfusion including myocardial perfusion are provided.

As used herein the term imaging agent refers to any species that includes at least one atom or group of atoms that may generate a detectable signal itself or upon exposure to an external source of energy e.g. electromagnetic radiation ultrasound etc. . Typically the imaging agent may be administered to a subject in order to provide information relating to at least a portion of the subject e.g. human . In some cases an imaging agent may be used to highlight a specific area of a subject rendering organs blood vessels tissues and or other portions more detectable and more clearly imaged. By increasing the detectability and or image quality of the object being studied the presence and extent of disease and or injury can be determined. The imaging agent may include a radioisotope for nuclear medicine imaging. A non liming example of an imaging agent also referred herein as imaging agent 1 comprises the formula 

As used herein an imaging moiety refers to an atom or group of atoms that is capable of producing a detectable signal itself or upon exposure to an external source of energy e.g. imaging agents comprising imaging moieties may allow for the detection imaging and or monitoring of the presence and or progression of a condition pathological disorder and or disease. Nuclear medicine imaging agents can include C N F I I Tc Tc In Cu Cu Ga and Ga as the imaging moiety. In some embodiments the imaging moiety is F. Imaging agents based on F have been used for imaging hypoxia and cancer 2002 27 655 667 .

In some embodiments a compound e.g. an imaging agent a fluoride species may be isotopically enriched with fluorine 18. Isotopically enriched refers to a composition containing isotopes of an element such that the resultant isotopic composition is other than the natural isotopic composition of that element. With regard to the compounds provided herein when a particular atomic position is designated as F it is to be understood that the abundance of F at that position is substantially greater than the natural abundance of F which is essentially zero. In some embodiments a fluorine designated as F may have a minimum isotopic enrichment factor of about 0.01 about 0.05 about 0.1 about 0.2 about 0.3 about 0.4 about 0.5 about 0.75 about 1 about 2 about 3 about 4 about 5 about 10 about 15 about 20 about 30 about 40 about 50 about 60 about 70 about 80 about 90 about 95 or greater. The isotopic enrichment of the compounds provided herein can be determined using conventional analytical methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art including mass spectrometry and HPLC.

The present invention provides methods for synthesizing imaging agents. In some cases the imaging agent is formed by reacting an imaging agent precursor with an imaging moiety. In certain embodiments a method involves reacting between an imaging agent precursor comprising a leaving group with a source of an imaging moiety e.g. a fluoride species .

For example the imaging moiety replaces the leaving group via a substitution reaction such as an S2 or S1 reaction. That is during the reaction an imaging moiety replaces the leaving group thereby producing the imaging agent.

The methods described herein may be used for the synthesis of a wide variety of imaging agents from an imaging agent precursor. Generally the imaging agent precursor may include at least one leaving group that may be displaced by an imaging moiety such as an F species. Imaging agent precursors may be synthesized using methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art and as described below.

In some embodiments a method for synthesizing a fluorinated compound comprises reacting in the presences of a carbonate or bicarbonate ion i a precursor of the fluorinated compound comprising an alkoxyalkyl group substituted with a halide or a sulfonate containing group with ii a salt comprising a fluoride species and weakly coordinating cation.

As used herein the term leaving group is given its ordinary meaning in the art of synthetic organic chemistry and refers to an atom or a group capable of being displaced by a nucleophile. Examples of suitable leaving groups include but are not limited to halides such as chloride bromide or iodide alkoxycarbonyloxy aryloxycarbonyloxy alkanesulfonyloxy arenesulfonyloxy alkyl carbonyloxy e.g. acetoxy arylcarbonyloxy aryloxy methoxy N O dimethylhydroxylamino pixyl haloformates and the like. In some cases the leaving group is a sulfonic acid ester such as toluenesulfonate tosylate TsO methanesulfonate mesylate MsO or trifluoromethanesulfonate triflate TfO . In some cases the leaving group may be a brosylate such as p bromobenzenesulfonyl. In some cases the leaving group may be a nosylate such as 2 nitrobenzenesulfonyl. The leaving group may also be a phosphineoxide e.g. formed during a Mitsunobu reaction or an internal leaving group such as an epoxide or cyclic sulfate. In some embodiments the leaving group is a sulfonate containing group. In some embodiments the leaving group is a tosylate group.

In certain embodiments the invention provides methods of synthesizing an imaging agent comprising a halogen. For example the method may involve a halogenation reaction. In some embodiments methods for synthesizing an imaging agent comprising a fluoride e.g. enriched with F are provided. The method comprises contacting an imaging agent precursor with a source of a fluoride under conditions that result in the fluoride replacing a leaving group of the precursor to produce an imaging agent comprising a fluoride species. In certain embodiments the method involves a nucleophilic fluorination reaction. That is an imaging agent precursor comprising a leaving group is reacted in the presence of a fluoride species whereby S2 or S1 displacement of the leaving group by the fluoride species produces the imaging agent. In some embodiments the fluoride species is enriched with F. shows an illustrative example where imaging agent precursor 1 is treated with an F species to produce imaging agent 1 via a substitution reaction.

In some embodiments one or more additives may be incorporated into the reaction mixture of the imaging agent precursor and the fluoride species. The additive may in some cases facilitate reaction between the imaging agent precursor and the fluoride species and or may aid in stabilizing the imaging agent. For example the fluoride species may have relatively low reactivity e.g. nucleophilicity and addition of an additive may enhance the reactivity of the fluoride species. As an illustrative embodiment a fluorine species may be a negatively charged fluoride ion e.g. an isotopically enriched F ion and an additive may be used to bind to any positively charged counterions present within the reaction mixture thereby enhancing the reactivity of the fluoride ion. In some embodiments the additives may decrease the rate of undesired side reactions as described below.

In some cases the additive may be combined with the fluoride species prior to contact with the imaging agent precursor. For example in certain embodiments a solution comprising the fluoride species and the additive is prepared and the solution is added to the imaging agent precursor. In other embodiments a solid comprising the fluoride species and the additive is prepared and the solid is contacted with the imaging agent precursor. In certain embodiments the fluoride species is adsorbed onto a solid support e.g. an anion exchange column and a solution comprising the additive is used to elute the fluoride species from the solid support. The eluted solution is then contacted with the imaging agent precursor or is concentrated to produce a solid which is then contacted with the imaging agent precursor.

In some embodiments the additive is a bicarbonate salt. In certain embodiments it has been discovered that substitution of a carbonate salt with a bicarbonate salt such as KHCO results in considerable improvement of both fluorination efficiency and starting material integrity. As used herein the term bicarbonate salt refers to a salt comprising a bicarbonate or hydrogen carbonate ion HCOion . The bicarbonate salt may be a metal bicarbonate such as sodium bicarbonate calcium bicarbonate potassium bicarbonate magnesium bicarbonate and the like. In certain embodiments the bicarbonate salt is potassium bicarbonate KHCO . In some embodiments the bicarbonate salt comprises a non metal counterion such as ammonium bicarbonate. For example the bicarbonate salt may be a tetraalkylammonium bicarbonate salt having the formula RNHCO wherein R is alkyl. In some embodiments R may be a lower alkyl such as methyl ethyl propyl butyl pentyl hexyl or the like. In certain embodiments the ammonium salt is EtNHCO. In other embodiments the salt is MeNHCO i PrNHCO n PrNHCO n BuNHCO i BuNHCO or t BuNHCO.

As described further in Example 14 it is thought that reaction conditions which activate larger differential rates of fluorination would result in a more efficient and chemoselective process that is a decreased rate of hydrolysis or increased rate of fluorination would result. The studies outlined herein revealed that although required for anion exchange KCOdid little to enhance fluorination over baseline levels and served primarily a detrimental role in the fluorination reaction. However in contrast addition of KHCOproduced a marked increase in fluorination over the same concentration range while decomposition pathways remained poorly differentiated. These facts coupled with the observation that F NaF exchange with tetraalkylammonium cations can directly produce a highly active nucleophilic fluoride source led to investigation of a series of salts in an effort to identify related counterion affects that increase the rate of fluorination.

A comprehensive screen of ammonium salts identified a dramatic enhancement of fluorination efficiency in the presence of bicarbonate anion e.g. see Table 1 only modest dependency on size of the alkyl substituent was observed within the series methyl ethyl butyl e.g. Example 14 .

Subsequent optimization of salt stoichiometry revealed that at levels as low as 25 mol of the tetraalkylammonium bicarbonate to an imaging agent precursor e.g. 0.25 1 resulted in near complete conversion of the imaging agent precursor to the imaging agent once again unproductive consumption of starting material occurred with increasing base concentration revealing an optimum stoichiometry range for the modified reaction conditions. Related studies directed toward determination of the optimal precursor concentration revealed a concentration threshold.

This reagent combination also demonstrated rapid conversion and significantly improved chemoselectivity toward fluorination over the KCO Kryptofix 222 method. In fact a more detailed evaluation of crude reaction mixtures revealed a dramatic reduction in overall decomposition rates as evidenced by the absence of hydrolytic impurities e.g. as described in Example 14 a result which may be attributed to a lower solution pH in the absence of Kryptofix 222 5 6 vs. 9 10 .

In some embodiments the additive is a salt comprising a cation that forms a weakly coordinating salt with a fluoride species. As used herein a cation that forms a weakly coordinating salt with a fluoride species refers to a cation that renders a fluoride species reactive within a fluorination reaction. For example the cation may not strongly bind to the fluoride species allowing the fluoride species to act as a nucleophile during a nucleophilic fluorination reaction Those of ordinary skill the art would be able to select an appropriate cation that would be suitable as a weakly coordinating counterion for a fluoride species. For example the cation may be have a relatively large atomic radius and or may be a weak Lewis base. In some cases the cation may be selected to be lipophilic. In some cases the cation may comprise one or more alkyl groups. Examples of weakly coordinating cations include cesium ions ammonium ions and the like. Examples of weakly coordinating cations include weakly coordinating salts of hexamethylpiperidindium S NMe P NMe tetraaalkylphosphonium salts tetraarylphosphonium salts e.g. tetraphenylphosphonium hexakis dimethylamino diphosphazenium tris dimethylamino sulfonium etc.

In some embodiments the additive is an ammonium salt i.e. a salt comprising a substituted or unsubstituted ammonium ion. In some cases the ammonium ion is a weakly coordinating cation. In some cases the ammonium salt has the formula RNX where each R can be the same or different and is alkyl heteroalkyl aryl heteroaryl or heterocyclic each optionally substituted and X is a negatively charged counterion. In some cases R is alkyl heteroalkyl aryl heteroaryl or heterocyclic each optionally substituted. The ammonium salt may include a wide range of negatively charged counterions including halides carbonates bicarbonates and the like. Examples of ammonium salts include but are not limited to ammonium bicarbonate salts ammonium hydroxide salts ammonium acetate salts ammonium lactate salts ammonium trifluoroacetate salts ammonium methanesulfonate salts ammonium p toluenesulfonate salts ammonium nitrate salts ammonium halide salts e.g. ammonium iodide salts ammonium bisulfate salts and the like.

In one set of embodiments the ammonium salt is a tetraalkylammonium salt such as a tetraalkylammonium bicarbonate salt. For example the ammonium salt may have the formula RNHCO wherein each R is independently alkyl. In some cases R is optionally substituted. In some embodiments the alkyl group is a lower C Calkyl group. In some embodiments the tetraalkylammonium salt is a basic tetraalkylammonium salt.

The salt additive e.g. bicarbonate salt and or ammonium salt may be utilized in the reaction such that the molar ratio of the salt additive to the imaging agent precursor is less than about 1.5 1. In some cases the molar ratio is about 1.5 1 or less about 1.4 1 or less about 1.3 1 or less about 1.25 1 or less about 1.2 1 or less about 1.1 1 or less about 1 1 or less about 0.75 1 or less about 0.5 1 or less about 0.25 1 or less about 0.1 1 or less or about 0.05 1 or less. In some cases the ratio is greater than about 0.05 1 greater than about 0.01 1 or greater than about 0.25 1. In some embodiments the molar ratio of salt additive to imaging agent precursor is about 0.5 1 to about 1 1 or about 0.25 1 to about 1 1 or about 0.25 1 to about 0.75 1 about 1.49 1 to about 0.05 1 or between about 1.4 1 to about 0.25 1 or between about 0.25 1 and about 1.4 1 or between about 0.25 1 and about 1.25 1.

Without wishing to be bound by theory the use of bicarbonate and ammonium salts may aid in decreasing the rate of competing reactions such as hydrolysis during nucleophilic fluorination of an imaging agent precursor.

In some embodiments the additive may be used in combination with a species capable of enhancing the reactivity of the fluoride species or otherwise facilitating conversion of the imaging agent precursor to the imaging agent. For example the species may be a compound capable of chelating one or more ions e.g. metal ions that may be present within the reaction mixture. Without wishing to be bound by theory the species may be used to chelate a counterion to a fluoride species such as a potassium ion thereby increasing the reactivity e.g. nucleophilicity of the fluoride species. In certain embodiments the additive is used in combination with a multidentate ligand such as a crown ether or a cryptand that is capable of chelating a metal ion. The multidentate ligand e.g. cryptand may be selected based on the metal ion to be chelated. The multidentate ligand may be for example 4 7 13 16 21 24 hexaoxa 1 10 diazabicyclo 8.8.8 hexacosane e.g. Kryptofix 222 . Other cryptands will be known to those of ordinary skill in the art.

Some embodiments may involve the use of a bicarbonate salt in combination with 4 7 13 16 21 24 hexaoxa 1 10 diazabicyclo 8.8.8 hexacosane. In a specific embodiment potassium bicarbonate may be used in combination with 4 7 13 16 21 24 hexaoxa 1 10 diazabicyclo 8.8.8 hexacosane.

In another set of embodiments it may be advantageous to utilize the methods described herein in the absence of a cryptand. The term cryptand is given its ordinary meaning in the art and refers to a bi or a polycyclic multidentate ligand for a cation. For example the method may be carried out using an ammonium salt in the absence of a cryptand e.g. such as 4 7 13 16 21 24 hexaoxa 1 10 diazabicyclo 8.8.8 hexacosane .

Those of ordinary skill in the art will be able to select and or determine the appropriate set of reaction conditions e.g. concentration temperature pressure reaction time solvents etc. suitable for use in a particular application. The imaging agent may be further processed using one or more purification techniques and may optionally be combined with additional components such as a stabilizing agent.

Those of ordinary skill in the art would be able to select a source of a fluoride species suitable for use in the methods described herein. The term fluoride species as used herein refers to a fluoride atom or group of atoms comprising at least one fluoride atom wherein the fluoride atom is capable of reacting with another compound e.g. an imaging agent precursor . In some embodiments an isotopically enriched F species may be produced by the nuclear reaction O p n F from proton bombardment of O HO in a cyclotron. The method may involve treating a solution of the F species to remove any impurities such as unreacted O HO. For example a solution of the F species may be filtered through an anion exchange column where the F species is retained on the cationic resin matrix while the O HO is eluted. The F species is then removed by washing the anion exchange column with various mixtures of solvents and optional additives e.g. salt additives forming an F containing solution. In some cases the anion exchange column is washed with an aqueous solution of a salt such as KHCOor EtNHCO.

In some cases the F containing solution is combined with additional components prior to reaction with an imaging agent precursor. For example one or more solvents may be added to dilute the F containing solution to a selected concentration. In one set of embodiments the F containing solution is diluted with acetonitrile.

In some cases the F containing solution may be concentrated to dryness by exposure to elevated temperature and or reduced pressure to form an anhydrous F containing solid. In some embodiments the F containing solid may further comprise one or more additives e.g. salt additives . The chemical composition of the F containing solid may depend on the number and kind of additives used in preparation of the F containing solution. For example a solution of potassium bicarbonate may be used to elute the F species from the anion exchange column thereby resulting in an F containing solid comprising F KF. In another example a solution of ammonium bicarbonate is used to elute the F species from the anion exchange column thereby resulting in an F containing solid comprising F EtNF.

In some cases the solution comprising the F species is heated to a temperature ranging from room temperature to about 200 C. In some embodiments the solution is heated to a temperature ranging from 90 120 C. In some cases the solution is heated to about 75 C. about 85 C. about 95 C. about 105 C. about 115 C. about 125 C. or greater.

In some embodiments the solution is concentrated to dryness at about 400 mbar and about 110 150 C. In some embodiments the solution is concentrated to dryness at about 280 mbar and about 95 115 C.

The fluoride species and or the additive if present is then contacted with the imaging agent precursor under conditions that result in conversion of the imaging agent precursor to the imaging agent product via nucleophilic fluorination. Those of ordinary skill in the art would be able to select conditions suitable for use in a particular reaction. For example the ratio of fluoride species to imaging agent precursor may be selected to be about 1 10 000 or more about 1 5000 or more about 1 3000 or more about 1 2000 or more 1 1000 or more 1 500 or more 1 100 or more 1 50 or more 1 10 or more 1 5 or more or in some cases 1 1 or more.

The solution may be for example an acetonitrile solution. In other embodiments a solution of the F species and additive if present is contacted with a solid imaging agent precursor or a solution of the imaging agent precursor.

Upon completion of the reaction the reaction mixture is then cooled e.g. to room temperature and optionally diluted with a solvent such as water.

Upon completion of the fluorination reaction the resulting imaging agent is optionally subjected to one or more purification steps. In some cases the synthesis purification and or formulation of an imaging agent e.g. a compound comprising formula II may be prepared using an automated reaction system comprising a cassette wherein the cassette may comprise a synthesis module a purification module and or a formulation module.

In some embodiments the present invention relates to methods of imaging including methods of imaging in a subject that includes administering a composition or formulation that includes imaging agent 1 to the subject by injection infusion or any other known method and imaging a region of the subject that is of interest. As described herein 2 t butyl 4 chloro 5 4 2 F fluoroethoxymethyl benzyloxy 2H pyridazin 3 1 or imaging agent 1 comprises the formula 

In some embodiments methods of the present invention include a administering to a subject a composition that includes imaging agent 1 and b acquiring at least one image of at least a portion of the subject. In some cases acquiring employs positron emission tomography PET for visualizing the distribution of imaging agent 1 within at least a portion of the subject. As will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art imaging using methods of the invention may include full body imaging of a subject or imaging of a specific body region or tissue of the subject that is of interest. For example if a subject is known to have or is suspected of having myocardial ischemia methods of the invention may be used to image the heart of the subject. In some embodiments imaging may be limited to the heart or may include the heart and its associated vascular system.

In some embodiments of the invention methods of diagnosing or assisting in diagnosing a disease or condition assessing efficacy of treatment of a disease or condition or imaging in a subject with a known or suspected cardiovascular disease or condition are provided. A cardiovascular disease can be any disease of the heart or other organ or tissue nourished by the vascular system. The vascular system includes coronary arteries and all peripheral arteries supplying nourishment to the peripheral vascular system and the brain as well as veins arterioles venules and capillaries. Examples of cardiovascular diseases include diseases of the heart such as coronary artery disease myocardial infarction myocardial ischemia angina pectoris congestive heart failure cardiomyopathy congenital or acquired arrhythmia or valvular heart disease. In some embodiments the methods disclosed herein are useful for monitoring and measuring coronary artery disease and or myocardial perfusion. For example a method described herein can determine the presence or absence of coronary artery disease and or the presence or absence of myocardial infarct. Conditions of the heart may include damage not brought on by disease but resulting from injury e.g. traumatic injury surgical injury. In some cases methods of the invention may include determining a parameter of or the presence or absence of myocardial ischemia rest R and or stress S myocardial blood flows MBFs coronary flow reserve CFR coronary artery disease CAD left ventricular ejection fraction LVEF end systolic volume ESV end diastolic volume EDV and the like.

In some cases a subject to whom a method of the invention is applied may have signs or symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction. In some cases methods of the invention can be used to identify early or pre disease conditions that indicate that a subject is at increased risk of a disease. In some instances methods of the invention can be used to determine a subject s risk of future cardiac events such as myocardial infarction or cardiac death. Imaging methods of the invention can be used to detect myocardial ischemia in subjects already diagnosed as having a myocardial ischemia disorder or condition or in subjects that have no history or diagnosis of such a condition. In other instances methods of the invention can be used to obtain measurements that provide a diagnosis or aid in providing a diagnosis of a myocardial ischemia disorder or condition. In some instances a subject may be already be undergoing drug therapy for a myocardial ischemia disorder or condition while in other instances a subject may not be undergoing therapy for myocardial ischemia. In some embodiments methods of the invention can be used to assess efficacy of a treatment for a disease or condition. For example the heart can be visualized using imaging agents of the invention before during and or after treatment of a condition affecting the heart of a subject. Such visualization may be used to assess a disease or condition and aid in selection of a treatment regimen e.g. therapy surgery medications for the subject.

A PET imaging agent may have a high first pass extraction fraction and can track regional myocardial blood flow over a wide range. These features may permit detection of milder decreases in coronary flow reserve and accurate estimation of absolute myocardial blood flow MBF . PET imaging agents of the invention provide these and other features and are also available as a unit dose from regional PET radiopharmacies obviating the need for on site cyclotrons or costly Rb 82 generators.

In some embodiments of the invention imaging agent 1 is used as an imaging agent in combination with positron emission tomography PET or with other imaging methods including but not limited to SPECT imaging. In some embodiments of the invention imaging agent 1 is administered to a subject and imaged in the subject using PET. As will be known to those of ordinary skill in the art PET is a non invasive technique that allows serial images and measurements to be obtained in a single subject over a time period. PET imaging used in methods of the invention may be carried out using known systems methods and or devices. In some embodiments of the invention PET imaging is conducted using a cardiac imaging system. A cardiac imaging system may include PET imaging functionality and a control unit configured to drive the imaging functionality to perform a PET imaging procedure on a portion of the subject before during and or after administration of imaging agent 1 to the subject. In some cases the control unit is configured to drive the imaging functionality to perform a PET imaging procedure. The control unit may comprise a computer system and or software. In such a case the computer system may be programmed or configured to execute the required methods for acquiring and or analyzing the images. Further the system may include a data storage device that is readable by a machine embodying a set of instructions executable by the machine to perform the required methods of acquiring and or analyzing the images.

The useful dosage of the imaging agent to be administered and the particular mode of administration will vary depending upon such factors as age weight and particular region to be imaged as well as the particular imaging agent used the diagnostic use contemplated and the form of the formulation for example suspension emulsion microsphere liposome or the like as described herein and as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.

In some embodiments an imaging agent is administered at a low dosage and the dosage increased until the desirable diagnostic effect is achieved. In one embodiment the above described imaging agents may be administered by intravenous injection usually in saline solution at a dose of about 0.1 to about 100 mCi per 70 kg body weight and all combinations and subcombinations of dosage ranges and specific dosages therein or between about 0.5 and about 50 mCi or between about 0.1 mCi and about 30 mCi or between 0.5 mCi and about 20 mCi. For use as nuclear medicine imaging agents the imaging agents dosages administered by intravenous injection may range from about 0.1 pmol kg to about 1000 pmol kg and all combinations and subcombinations of dosage ranges and specific dosages therein and in some embodiments less than 150 pmol kg.

Imaging systems and components thereof will be known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Many imaging systems and components e.g. cameras software for analyzing the images etc. are known and commercially available for example a Siemens Biograph 64 scanner. Any technique software or equipment that reduces or eliminates motion in static perfusion images may be used in methods of the invention because spatial blurring and artifacts can be caused by patient motion during image acquisition. In some embodiments of the invention images may be acquired in list mode and may be static dynamic or gated images. An appropriate period of time for acquiring images can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art and may vary depending on the cardiac imaging system the imaging agent e.g. amount administered composition of the imaging agent subject parameters area of interest . As used herein a period of acquiring images or an image acquisition period may be a period of obtaining a single continuous image or may be a period during which one or more individual discrete images are obtained. Thus a period of image acquisition can be a period during which one or more images of one or more regions of a subject are acquired.

In some embodiments of the invention a period of image acquisition after administration of an imaging agent of the invention to a subject may be between about 30 seconds and about 60 minutes between about 1 minute and about 30 minutes between about 5 minutes and about 20 minutes or at least about 1 minute about 3 minutes about 5 minutes about 6 minutes about 7 minutes about 8 minutes about 9 minutes about 10 minutes about 15 minutes about 20 minutes about 30 minutes 4 about 5 minutes about 60 minutes or greater. For example in a rest stress imaging protocol there would be at least two periods of image acquisition with at least one corresponding to the rest segment and least one corresponding to the stress segment. In some embodiments imaging may be continuous over the imaging period of time or images may be acquired at intervals such as in periodic or gated imaging.

In some aspects of the invention gated acquisition is used to acquire images from a subject to whom an imaging agent prepared by methods of such as imaging agent 1 has been administered. Gated imaging can be used in various aspects of the invention and for example may provide images of a beating heart of a subject and may be used to attain a functional evaluation of how well a heart is beating. Gated imaging can be performed by acquiring separate images from the subject at specific intervals during a period of image acquisition. A non limiting example of gated imaging is a case when a period of image acquisition is about 10 minutes long and images are acquired at repeated intervals during the 10 minute period. The frequency of acquisition of images during the period can be set by the operator for example the frequency can be at least every about 1 msec about 5 msec about 10 msec about 20 msec about 50 msec about 100 msec about 125 msec about 250 msec or more. The length of the interval is set by the operator to be triggered by an event such as a cardiac R wave with the length of the interval is defined by the number of time bins desired per R wave to R wave interval. Those of skill in the art will be familiar with the concept and methods of gated image acquisition and can use known methods to obtain gated images using imaging agent 1 as an imaging agent.

Image acquisition in gated imaging can be triggered at specific intervals for example image acquisition can be triggered using an EKG of the heart. In a non limiting example an R wave gated scanner may trigger acquisition of an image and the mean length of time between one R wave of a heart and the next can be stored. The number of images to collect can then be determined. For example a first image can be acquired at 125 msec a second image can be acquired at 250 msec a third image can be acquired at 375 msec etc. thus images in that R interval may be acquired at 125 msec intervals. When the next R interval begins the collection of images resets and image data is then acquired into the first image at 125 msec from that R interval start time and then into the second image collected 250 msec from that R interval start time etc. Thus within each R interval image acquisition is added into the initial image of the series and incremented into successive images in the series so that a sequence of images can be collected at a desired frequency with the zero time being reset at the start of each R interval. Acquired gated images can be used to provide an image of heart motion and can provide information on heart wall thickness whether or not one or more sections of the heart are not moving or beating e.g. a wall motion defect . Use of gated imaging may provide data with which to judge perfusion of the heart such as ejection fraction and to visualize and identify reduced absent paradoxical or asynchronous wall motion. Use of gated imaging may also provide data with which to improve assessment of myocardial perfusion judge cardiac function and to visualize and identify asynchronous wall motion.

In some cases PET imaging may be used to assess myocardial viability via the ability of this technique to demonstrate metabolic consequences of myocardial ischemia. Using PET imaging myocardial segments that are likely to improve after revascularization can be identified. In some cases PET imaging may be used in the detection of coronary artery disease and can also serve as an alternative test for subjects who cannot undergo treadmill exercise stress testing. In some embodiments a stress test method e.g. pharmacological stress exercise stress may be employed with PET using methods of the invention to qualitatively or quantitatively assess one or more parameters of cardiac function during infusion of the imaging agent. Agents for and methods of inducing stress for example using exercise or pharmacological stress are well known in the art. Suitable induction of stress can be carried out using established known agents and methods. Functions usefully measured using methods of the invention include but are not limited to in various embodiments imaging of myocardial perfusion imaging or measurement of ventricular function and measuring coronary blood flow velocity.

In some cases methods for imaging the heart of a subject may include administering a first dose of imaging agent 1 to the subject while the subject is at rest acquiring at least one first image of the heart followed by subjecting the subject to stress e.g. exercise stress or pharmacological stress and administering a second dose of imaging agent 1 to the subject during the period of stress and acquiring at least one other image of the heart.

In some embodiments the dose of imaging agent 1 to be used during exercise induced stress in a rest stress protocol is greater than that necessary for pharmacologically induced stress with the ratio of exercise induced stress dose to pharmacologically induced stress dose being greater then or equal to about 1.2 about 1.3 about 1.4 about 1.5 about 1.6 about 1.7 about 1.8 about 1.9 or greater. With respect to pharmacological stress in some embodiments of the invention that involve rest stress imaging methods the dose of imaging agent 1 administered for imaging during the pharmacological stress is a minimum of two times the dose of imaging agent 1 administered for imaging at rest. With respect to exercise stress in some embodiments of the invention that involve rest stress imaging methods the dose of imaging agent 1 administered for imaging during the exercise induced stress is a minimum of three times the dose of imaging agent 1 administered for imaging at rest. In some embodiments of the invention for imaging first at rest followed by imaging with stress the dose of imaging agent 1 administered at rest will be lower than the dose of imaging agent 1 administered at stress.

In some cases imaging methods of the invention may be completed in a single day e.g. less than about 24 hours less than about 12 hours less than about 6 hours less than about 4 hours less than about 2 hours less than about 1 hour as described herein. In other cases methods may be completed in longer periods of time e.g. over more than about 24 hours about 36 hours or about 48 hours.

Imaging agent 1 may be provided in any suitable form for example in a pharmaceutically acceptable form. In some cases imaging agent 1 is included in a pharmaceutically acceptable composition. In some embodiments imaging agent 1 is provided as a composition comprising ethanol sodium ascorbate and water. In some cases the composition comprises less than 20 weight ethanol less than 15 weight ethanol less than 10 weight ethanol less than 8 weight ethanol less than 6 weight ethanol less than 5 weight ethanol less than 4 weight ethanol less than 3 weight ethanol or less ethanol.

In a particular non limiting embodiment imaging agent 1 is provided as a solution in water comprising less than 4 ethanol and less than 50 mg mL sodium ascorbate in water.

An imaging agent 1 composition for injection may be prepared in an injection syringe. Imaging agent 1 may be prepared by a radiopharmacy e.g. using the methods described herein and or a PET manufacturing center and provided to a health care professional for administration. In some aspects of the invention imaging agent 1 is provided for example in a syringe or other container with

A syringe of the invention may also comprise sodium ascorbate ethanol and water and certain embodiments of the invention include a syringe containing imaging agent 1 in a solution comprising less than 4 ethanol and less than 50 mg mL sodium ascorbate in water. A syringe of the invention may be a syringe that is latex free rubber free and or lubricant free. A syringe of the invention may contain imaging agent 1 in an amount between about 1.5 and about 14 mCi. A syringe of the invention may contain about 20 mCi or less of imaging agent 1.

Components of a composition comprising imaging agent 1 may be selected depending on the mode of administration to the subject. Various modes of administration that effectively deliver imaging agents of the invention to a desired tissue cell organ or bodily fluid will be known to one of ordinary skill in the art. In some embodiments the imaging agent is administered intravenously e.g. intravenous bolus injection using methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art. As used herein a dose that is administered to a subject means an amount of the imaging agent e.g. imaging agent 1 that enters the body of the subject. In some embodiments due to factors such as partial retention of imaging agent such as imaging agent 1 in a syringe tubing needles catheter or other equipment used to administer the imaging agent to a subject the amount of an imaging agent such as imaging agent 1 that is measured or determined to be in the a syringe or other equipment prepared for administration may be more than the amount in the dose that is administered to the subject. In some embodiments an injection of an imaging agent is followed by a flushing injection of normal saline into the subject using the same tubing needle port etc. used for administration of imaging agent 1. Flushing may be performed immediately following administration of imaging agent 1 or up to 1 min 2 min 3 min 5 min or more after the administration. The volume of saline or other agent for flushing may be up to 5 ml 6 ml 7 ml 8 ml 9 ml 10 ml 15 ml 20 ml or more. As will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art in embodiments where imaging agent 1 is administered using a syringe or other container the true amount of imaging agent 1 administered to the subject may be corrected for any imaging agent 1 that remains in the container. For example the amount of radioactivity remaining in the container and tubing and needle or delivery instrument that carried the imaging agent from the container and into the subject can be determined after the imaging agent has been administered to the subject and the difference between the starting amount of radioactivity and the amount remaining after administration indicates the amount that was delivered into the subject. In some cases the container or injection device e.g. catheter syringe may be rinsed with a solution e.g. saline solution following administration of imaging agent 1.

In some embodiments of the invention the total amount of imaging agent 1 administered to a subject over a given period of time e.g. in one session is less than or equal to about 50 mCi less than or equal to 40 mCi less than or equal to 30 mCi less than or equal to 20 mCi less than or equal to 18 mCi less than or equal to 16 mCi less than or equal to 15 mCi less than or equal to 14 mCi less than or equal to 13 mCi less than or equal to 12 mCi less than or equal to 10 mCi less than or equal to 8 mCi less than or equal to 6 mCi less than or equal to 4 mCi less than or equal to 2 mCi less than or equal to 1 mCi less than or equal to 0.5 mCi. The total amount administered may be determined based on a single dose or multiple doses administered to a subject within a given time period of up to 1 minute 10 minutes 30 minutes 1 hour 2 hours 6 hours 12 hours 24 hours 48 hours or more.

Based on radiation dose studies the desirable maximum dose administered to a subject may be based on determining the amount of imaging agent 1 which limits the radiation dose to about 5 rem to the critical organ and or about 1 rem effective dose ED or lower as will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. In a particular embodiment the desirable maximum dose or total amount of imaging agent 1 administered is less than or equal to about 25 mCi or less than or equal to about 14 mCi over a period of time of up to 30 min 1 hour 2 hours 6 hours 12 hours 24 hours 48 hours or more. In some embodiments the maximum dose of imaging agent 1 administered to a subject may be less than 3.5 g per 50 kg of body weight per day. That is in some embodiments of the invention the maximum dose of imaging agent 1 administered to a subject may be less than about 0.07 g of imaging agent 1 per kg of body weight per day.

In some embodiments methods of the invention include administering to a subject a first dose e.g. rest dose of imaging agent 1 while the subject is at rest and performing a first PET imaging procedure e.g. a PET rest imaging procedure and acquiring at least a first image of a portion of a subject. In some cases after administering an imaging agent such as imaging agent 1 while the subject is at rest the subject may be subjected to stress and during the stress a second dose e.g. stress dose of an imaging agent such as imaging agent 1 is administered to the subject and a second PET imaging procedure e.g. a PET stress imaging procedure is performed on the subject and at least one other image of a portion of the subject may be acquired. The above is an example of a method that may be referred to as a rest stress test. The time between the completion of the first PET imaging procedure and administration of the second imaging agent dose is referred to as the wait time. In some cases a rest stress test may be completed in a period of time of less than 48 hours less than 36 hours less than 24 hours less than 12 hours less than 6 hours less than 5 hours less than 4 hours less than 3 hours less than 2 hours less than 1 hour less than 30 minutes or less.

In some embodiments the amount of imaging agent 1 administered in a first dose to a subject at rest e.g. rest dose in a rest stress test is between about 1 mCi and about 5 mCi between about 2 mCi and about 4 mCi between about 2.5 mCi and about 3.5 mCi or about 3 mCi. Following administration of the first dose of imaging agent 1 a PET imaging procedure may be performed and at least one first image may be acquired of at least a portion of the subject.

In some cases the amount of imaging agent 1 administered to a subject during stress may be based on the amount of imaging agent 1 administered to the subject at rest. That is the dosing during stress may be based at least in part on a dosing ratio DR e.g. ratio of stress dose to rest dose . The DR may depend on numerous factors as will be known to those of ordinary skill in the art and in some cases may depend on the method of inducing stress in the subject. In some cases the DR is between 1 and 5 between 1 and 4 between 1 and 3 between 2 and 5 or between 2 and 4. In some cases the DR is at least 1 at least 1.5 at least 2 at least 3 at least 4 or at least 5. In some cases the DR is between 2.5 and 5.0 or 2.5 and 4.0 or 3.0 and 4.0 or 3.0 and 5.0 times greater than the first dose of the imaging agent. In some cases the DR required for a subject subjected to exercise stress is more than the DR and or time interval used for a subject subjected to pharmacological stress. This may be due in part to a lower net myocardial uptake of radioactivity with exercise. In some cases the DR employed for a subject subjected to exercise stress is between 2 and 4 between 2.5 and 3.5 or at least 3.0 at least 3.5 at least 4.0 or more in embodiments wherein the wait time is at least 15 minutes 30 minutes 1 hour 1.5 hours 2 hours or the like. In some cases the DR employed for a subject subjected to pharmacological stress is between 1 and 3 or between 1.5 and 2.5 or at least 2.0 at least 2.2 or at least 2.5 or more in embodiments wherein the wait time is at least 15 minutes 30 minutes 1 hour 1.5 hours 2 hours or the like. In a particular embodiment for a subject subjected to pharmacological stress a DR of at least 2.2 for a wait time of at least 15 minutes or at least 30 minutes is employed and or for a subject subjected to exercise stress a DR of at least 3.0 for a wait time of at least 30 minutes or at least 1 hour is employed.

In some cases the second dose of the imaging agent is between about 5.7 mCi and about 6.2 mCi or between about 6.0 mCi and about 6.5 mCi and about 5.7 mCi and about 6.5 mCi.

In another embodiment for exercise stress a dose of about 1.7 mCi to about 2.0 mCi is provided during rest and a dose of about 3.0 to about 3.6 times the rest dose is provided during stress with a wait time of at least about 30 minute or at least about 60 minutes. In some cases the second dose of the imaging agent is between about 8.6 mCi and about 9.0 mCi or between about 9.0 and about 9.5 mCi or between about 8.6 mCi and about 9.5 mCi.

In another embodiment for pharmacological stress a dose of between about 2.4 mCi and about 2.9 mCi is administered during rest and a dose between about 5.7 mCi and about 6.2 mCi is administered during stress e.g. DR of at least about 2 wherein the wait time is at least about 15 minutes or at least about 30 minutes. In another embodiment for exercise stress a dose of between about 1.7 mCi and about 2.0 mCi is administered during rest and a dose of between about 8.6 mCi and about 9.0 mCi is administered during stress e.g. DR at least about 3 wherein the wait time is at least 30 minutes or at least 60 minutes.

In some cases the second dose may be administered at a period of time of at least 5 minutes 10 minutes 15 minutes 20 minutes 30 minutes 40 minutes 45 minutes 50 minutes 60 minutes 70 minutes 80 minutes 90 minutes 2 hours 4 hours 6 hours 12 hours 24 hours or greater after completing the rest imaging procedure. In some cases the second dose is administered at a time period of between 5 minutes and 30 days between 5 minutes and 20 days between 5 minutes and 10 days between 5 minutes and 5 days between 5 minutes and 4 days between 5 minutes and 3 days between 5 minutes and 48 hours between 5 minutes and 24 hours between 5 minutes and 12 hours between 5 minutes and 2 hours between 5 minutes and 90 minutes between 10 minutes and 60 minutes after completing the rest imaging procedure.

For stress testing in methods of the invention a subject may be subjected to stress using procedures known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In some cases the subject may be subjected to stress using procedures including exercise stress and or pharmacological stress. Pharmacological stress may be induced by administering to the subject a pharmacological agent such as a vasodilator. Examples of useful pharmacological stress agents include but are not limited to adenosine dobutamine dipyridamole regadenoson binodeneson apadeneson and other adenosine A2a receptor agonists. Dosing and administration of pharmacological stress inducing agents such as vasodilators are well known in the art and can be determined for use in conjunction with methods and systems of the invention. Exercise stress may be induced using a treadmill exercise bicycle hand crank or other equipment suitable to increase a subject s heart rate through increased exertion.

In some embodiments of the invention a rest stress method is followed.

Upon evaluation of several experimental parameters in the nucleophilic fluorination of imaging agent precursor 1 using KCO Kryptofix 222 overall reaction complexity was shown to increase with added KCO comparable fluorination efficiency was observed regardless of reagent stoichiometry. Elevated base e.g. carbonate levels were simply correlated to unproductive consumption of starting material e.g. imaging agent precursor . Substitution of KCOwith KHCOresulted in considerable improvement of both fluorination efficiency and starting material integrity. The solution pH remained uniform regardless of base identity and reagent stoichiometry the presence or absence of Kryptofix 222 determines global solution pH. The fluorination efficiency remained stable regardless of reagent stoichiometry indicating a more complex role of added base within the reaction coordinate.

As noted above KCOdid little to enhance fluorination over baseline levels and served primarily a detrimental role in the reaction. In contrast added KHCOproduced a marked increase in fluorination over the same dynamic range while decomposition pathways remained poorly differentiated. These facts coupled with the knowledge that F NaF exchange with tetraalkylammonium cations is known to directly produce a highly active nucleophilic fluoride source led to the investigation of a series of commercially available salts in an effort to identify related counterion affects that amplify the rate of fluorination e.g. see .

A series of different bases was used in the nucleophilic fluorination of a tosylate precursor using TBAF as a source of fluoride shown above according to the following procedure. A 2 mL glass vial was charged with both BuNF 1.15 mol 13.4 L of a 85.9 mM solution in HO and BuNHCO 10.4 mol 138 L of a 75.0 mM solution in HO then warmed to 95 C. and maintained 10 min under a stream of dry nitrogen. The resulting solid mixture was treated with the product of Example 8 11.5 mol 1.00 mL of a 11.5 mM solution in MeCN then warmed to 90 C. and maintained 10 min. After cooling to 22 C. the resulting solution was diluted with HO then directly analyzed by HPLC on a Zorbax SB C18 column 4.6 50 mm using a HO MeCN gradient containing 0.1 HCOH with a flow rate of 1.00 mL min. The reaction yield was then calculated through comparison of the integrated peak area for the product in the crude reaction mixture to that of the authentic standard product Table 1 results obtained through substitution of several alternate salt forms are also provided for comparison.

An enhancement of fluorination efficiency was observed in the presence of bicarbonate anion. Additionally a modest dependence on size of the alkyl substituent was observed when R methyl ethyl butyl data not shown .

A 1.5 fold improvement in yield was observed using the KF Kryptofix 222 method when changing from no added salt to one equivalent potassium carbonate to one equivalent potassium bicarbonate.

Additionally the amount of salt additive was varied relative to the amount of starting material e.g. imaging agent precursor in order to investigate the effect of salt additive concentration on the reaction. shows A a graph illustrating the changes in product distribution as a function of molar concentration of bicarbonate salt and B a graph illustrating the product distribution as a function of reaction time. Investigation of the salt stoichiometry revealed that 25 mol or 0.25 equivalents relative to the imaging agent precursor of tetraalkylammonium bicarbonate was needed for complete conversion and unproductive consumption of starting material occurred with increasing base concentration revealing an optimum stoichiometry range for the modified reaction conditions. Related studies directed toward determination of the optimal precursor concentration revealed a rather distinct concentration threshold. illustrates a threshold of 3 mg ml.

The use of tetraalkylammonium bicarbonate as an additive in the absence of Kryptofix 222 during nucleophilic fluorination resulted in rapid conversion to the desired product and significantly improved chemoselectivity toward fluorination relative to the use of KCO Kryptofix 222 method. A detailed evaluation of crude reaction mixtures revealed a dramatic reduction in overall decomposition rates when tetraalkylammonium bicarbonate was used as evidenced by the absence of four hydrolytic impurities present when KCO Kryptofix 222 was used. Without wishing to be bound by theory this may be attributed to the fact that the use of a tetraalkylammonium bicarbonate allows the reaction to be conducted at a lower absolute pH e.g. a pH of about 5 6 .

The following example investigates the effect of the presence of potassium carbonate in a nucleophilic fluorination reaction. A yield of 36 is obtained in the presence of potassium carbonate while a yield of 35 is obtained in the absence of potassium carbonate.

The following example describes the results obtained using different fluoride sources in a nucleophilic fluorination reaction. A yield of 71 is obtained in the presence of KF Kryptofix 222 while a yield of 83 is obtained in the presence of tetrabutylammonium fluoride.

A yield of 83 is obtained in the presence of the bicarbonate base while a yield of 36 is obtained in the presence of the hydroxide base.

The following describes a comparison of imaging agent 1 and Rb PET versus SPECT for detection of myocardial ischemia. In preclinical studies myocardial uptake of imaging agent 1 exhibits a stronger relationship with myocardial blood flow across the range of achievable flow than Tl Tc sestamibi and Rb. The following experiments were conducted to determine if the improved extraction and retention of imaging agent 1 would result in a greater difference between PET and SPECT ischemia detection by imaging agent 1 versus Rb.

Methods Twenty six patients 20 men who underwent Tc sestamibi SPECT and imaging agent 1 PET within 6 months at a single center in a phase II clinical trial were compared to 23 patients matched by summed difference score SDS on SPECT who underwent Tc sestamibi SPECT and Rb PET 25 50 mCi within 6 months without change in clinical state. PET was performed with imaging agent 1 at rest 2.3 3.9 mCi followed 60 min or 24 h later with exercise or adenosine stress 7.3 8.6 mCi . Perfusion defects on SPECT and PET were assessed by computer assisted visual interpretation using the standard 17 segment 5 point scoring model 0 normal 4 absent uptake . The extent and severity of ischemia SDS was derived from the difference between summed stress score SSS and summed rest scores SRS .

Results In 14 patients with abnormal SPECT SSS 4 mean SDS was greater with imaging agent 1 than with SPECT 9.6 1.8 versus 5.4 0.7 p 0.02 . In a matched group of 13 patients with abnormal SPECT mean SDS was similar with Rb PET and SPECT 4.9 1.4 versus 4.6 1.3 p 0.8 . In patients with normal SPECT SSS 

Imaging agent 1 PET showed an increase in the amount of ischemia detected relative to Tc sestamibi SPECT that was not seen when comparing Rb PET to SPECT in a comparable patient group. These results suggest that imaging agent 1 show greater improvement in detection of myocardial ischemia when PET is compared to SPECT than is associated with the use of Rb.

The following describes multicenter development of normal perfusion and function limits for stress and rest cardiac PET. The study included development of normal perfusion distribution limits and characterization of normal cardiac function measured by a cardiac perfusion F based agent imaging agent 1 .

Methods Normal limits were established from 15 low likelihood patients 7F 8M average age 54.7 y average weight 74.2 kg with treadmill exercise stress rest datasets 30 datasets in total recruited in a clinical trial phase 2 for the F imaging agent 1 perfusion agent acquired on a Siemens Biograph 64 PET CT scanner in list mode. Standard reconstruction 2D Attenuation Weighted Ordered Subsets Expectation Maximization with voxel size of 2.6 2.6 2.0 mm 8 bin gating was used for the gated reconstruction. 5 minute reconstructions were considered obtained approximately 5 min after isotope injection for stress and rest. The Cedars Sinai QPET PET function and perfusion analysis software was used for all the processing and for the normal perfusion database creation. 2 out of 30 scans 6.7 for gated studies and 1 out of 30 for ungated studies 3.3 required manual intervention in the definition of the left ventricle LV all other processing was fully automatic.

Results Left ventricular counts were 33.33 6.44 million counts range 22.76 44.29 for stress and 7.56 1.86 million counts range 5.12 11.77 for rest. The stress rest count ratio was 4.53 0.88 2.88 6.16 . Average trans ischemic dilation TID was 0.974 0.124 with upper normal limit of 1.22.

The following describes results of absolute quantification of rest and stress myocardial blood flow with imaging agent 1 PET in normal and coronary artery disease patients. Imaging agent 1 is a new myocardial perfusion PET tracer that targets mitochondrial complex 1. In this study the quantification of rest R and stress S myocardial blood flows MBFs and coronary flow reserve CFR was explored with this tracer in normal and coronary artery disease CAD patients.

Methods Eleven patients 8 with a low likelihood of CAD and 3 with CAD and presence of reversible defects received IV injection of imaging agent 1 at rest and at peak adenosine pharmacological vasodilation. Dynamic PET images were obtained for 10 minutes beginning with the administration of the tracer. On reoriented short axis images regions of interest were placed on the normal and defect regions of the myocardium and the left ventricular blood pool from which time activity curves TACs were generated. Patlak analysis was applied to myocardial TAC 0.4 1.5 min using the blood pool TAC as the input function to give the uptake constant K in the myocardium. Partial volume and spillover corrections were applied to blood pool and myocardial TACs to ensure the intercept of the regression line on the Patlak plot was close to zero. The first pass extraction fraction for imaging agent 1 in humans was assumed to be 0.94 i.e. MBF K 0.94 equivalent to that observed in prior studies e.g. see Huisman et al. 2008 49 630 6 .

Results S MBF was similar p NS in LL patients and in the myocardial regions which were supplied by normal coronary arteries in CAD patients NCA . R MBF however was higher p

The study data showed that absolute MBF could be quantified at rest and stress in humans using imaging agent 1 myocardial perfusion PET imaging.

The following describes an iterative technique for optimizing injected tracer dosage and acquisition time for F labeled myocardial perfusion tracer imaging agent 1. Public and staff concerns about radiation exposure necessitate optimization of the dosage acquisition time product DATP to obtain the optimal tradeoff between dose acquisition time and image noise. An iterative algorithm was developed for determining optimal dosage and acquisition time based on a task limited noise level.

Methods The mean and standard deviation SD were determined from a region of interest ROI of the myocardium to define a ratio mean SD MSD . Using SD and a surrogate for noise has its limitations 1 intrinsic count variability due to partial volume and tracer uptake and 2 non Poisson nature of reconstructed and post filtered data. The iterative algorithm was used to fit a model to the limiting MSD. From this an optimal acquisition time was determined for a target MSD to detect a 5 perfusion defect.

Data Acquisitions Phantom data simulating patient distributions and a 40 septal defect were acquired on a Biograph 64 slice PET CT scanner using a 30 minute listmode acquisition. The technique was also tested in 18 subjects. Patients received a 2 mCi at rest and 2 mCi stress on the following day. A dynamic series for 10 20 40 80 160 and 320 seconds was acquired 10 minutes post injection. The myocardial ROI was taken from a separate 600 second acquisition using 70 of the maximum myocardial voxel limit

Data Analysis The phantom data converged to theoretical DATP of 9.5 mCi simulated min. In patients the iterative algorithm converged to a solution in 18 Rest 9 Ad and 8 Ex. The results are summarized in Table 4 

The iterative technique for solving for optimal dosage acquisition time product converged for phantom and patient studies. Using this result an optimal acquisition times for rest adenosine and exercise stress was determined. Furthermore it was determined that the algorithm can be used to test alternative filtering and detection limit and used to extrapolate to the performance of lower sensitivity scanners.

The following describes the independence of myocardial functional parameters LVEF EDV and ESV across a large range of acquisition times as measured from radiotracer imaging agent 1. The accurate measurement of functional parameters using myocardial perfusion PET requires adequate count density. The correlation of functional parameters left ventricular ejection fraction LVEF end systolic volume ESV and end diastolic volume EDV were examined with acquisition time.

Methods To analyze the robustness of functional measurements to variations in count density a series of low count 1 3 5 minute adenosine AD 3 5 minute rest 5 10 minute exercise EX to high count 15 minute AD 10 minute rest 15 minute EX ECG gated 16 time bin PET data sets from listmode data were produced. LVEF ESV and EDV were measured using the QPET analysis program.

Data acquisition from 23 patients from two study centers. Data for this study was acquired using a same day rest stress study. Patients received 2 mCi at rest and also received a 6 mCi same day stress 8 EX 13 AD dosage. Functional values from shorter rebinning times were compared with the longest acquisition time dataset. Correlations were determined using linear regression analysis.

Results For all acquisition times examined regression slopes were within 10 of unity with the exception of the 1 minute adenosine 20 . Correlation coefficients are in Table 5.

The high count density present in cardiac imaging agent 1 myocardial perfusion PET images showed robust functional measurements across a wide range of count densities is possible. Modest variations in parameters affecting count density such as BMI and variations in dosage are unlikely to alter functional measurements.

The following describes the development of a method for the determination of minimum inter injection interval for a one day rest stress protocol with imaging agent 1 PET myocardial perfusion. A one day rest stress protocol for myocardial perfusion imaging MPI needs minimization of wait time between injections WT as shorter times require greater stress rest dosing ratios DR and minimum rest dose is dictated by image statistics. A method for determining the dependence of DR on WT and to identify a WT for acceptable total dose was developed.

Methods Two day rest stress imaging agent 1 PET image data of the heart 5 adenosine AD and 5 exercise EX stress from 20 patients with known reversible defects on Tc 99m MPI were combined to create artificial blended images by adding 16 23 48 or 100 of rest image to the stress image. These were paired with rest images 2 day stress images and read by 3 blinded readers. Results were recorded by segment as reader response RR 0 to 4 and as quantitative defect severity QDS in decrease.

Results RR was found to be linearly related to the QDS. In general decreases greater than 80 of maximum were read as 0 70 to 80 as 1 60 to 70 as 2 50 to 60 as 3 and below 50 as 4. Analysis of RR indicated that greater than 1 unit change from the 2 day data were observed in reader response in general only for the 48 and 100 blended image sets. Therefore 23 was deemed the maximum tolerable rest to stress contamination. Using the relationship between rest stress contamination and dosing it was found that for AD a minimum DR of 2.2 was required with a 0.5 hour WT and for EX a minimum DR of 3.0 was needed with a 1 hour WT.

Maximum tolerated rest to stress contamination levels were determined from modeled images. The uptake properties of imaging agent 1 with elevated coronary flow made it possible to tolerate a relatively low DR and short WT for AD studies while a longer WT and higher DR is needed for EX studies.

The following describes the design of a 1 day rest stress PET MPI protocol that requires selection of doses and imaging times for both rest and stress phases as well as the interval between rest and stress doses.

These parameters were determined using three properties of imaging agent 1 in myocardial perfusion imaging 1 the injected dose at rest that yields a diagnostic quality image for a given acquisition time 2 the maximum acceptable contribution of the rest dose to the stress image and 3 the maximum total injected dose that may be administered based on radiation dose considerations.

The minimum rest dose for a given imaging acquisition time in which the count related signal to noise did not meaningfully contribute to reader error was determined. This was done by simulating increasing doses using multiple rebinnings of patient rest study with increasingly greater amounts of data. This method uses the increasing number of coincidence events in sequential rebinnings to create images that model increasing dose and or acquisition duration. This method is valid for relatively low concentrations of radioactivity such as are used here.

When the relationship between the dose and acquisition time are known the rest dose for Cohort 2 was calculated. After considering the dosing required for a range of acquisition times from two minutes up to a practical maximum of 10 minutes five minutes was selected. This permitted an initial dose of 2.9 mCi for the rest acquisition.

To determine the stress dose for a given rest dose the dosing ratio was determined. To do this first the maximum tolerable contribution of the rest dose to the stress image was determined. This was assessed by creating simulated stress images with a range of rest dose contributions using combinations of data from the Study Day 1 rest and Study Day 2 stress studies.

The final step of the method is the need to maintain the total dose below a limit of 14 mCi with some additional margin to limit the radiation dose to 5 rem to the critical organ and 1 rem effective dose ED or lower.

Using the maximum rest contribution to the stress image from the analysis a range of dosing intervals was considered from a minimum of 15 minutes essentially immediately to a maximum practical limit of 2 hours. Based on this it was possible to select a 30 minute interval for adenosine stress that yielded a corresponding ratio of the stress dose to the rest dose of 2.0.

For exercise stress a combination of a longer dosing interval and greater dose ratio was needed due to the lower net myocardial uptake of radioactivity with exercise. Thus a dosing interval of 60 minutes was chosen which corresponded to a dose ratio of 3.0. The rest acquisition time was increased to 7 minutes and the rest dose reduced to 1.7 mCi to allow for the greater required stress rest dose ratio while still maintaining the total comfortably within the 14 mCi limit.

In order to allow some range of dosing and to avoid variations in dosing that might jeopardize the integrity of the study the dose and dose ratio values above were set as the lower limits of 15 to 20 ranges for each variable and the acquisition times increased to a minimum of 15 minutes for all acquisitions to account for the possibility of lower sensitivity of the 2D PET scanners. The data acquisition was broken into sections so that images derived from shorter acquisition times may be obtained from the same data as necessary. This resulted in the final specified dosing of 2.9 mCi to 3.4 mCi rest with a stress dose of 2.0 to 2.4 times the rest dose for adenosine stress. For exercise stress the final doses were set at 1.7 mCi to 2.0 mCi for rest with a stress dose 3.0 to 3.6 times the rest dose. These doses are intended to reflect the actual net injected radioactivity so that additional radioactivity is required in the syringe prior to injection to compensate for losses due to adsorption and the dead volume of the syringe.

The following describes human safety dosimetry biodistribution and rest stress myocardial imaging characteristics of F labeled imaging agent 1 myocardial perfusion PET tracer. F labeled imaging agent 1 is a novel myocardial perfusion imaging PET tracer that targets mitochondrial complex 1. Studies of human safety dosimetry biodistribution and myocardial imaging characteristics of this tracer were evaluated.

Methods 25 normal subjects were enrolled in 2 studies 13 received 222 MBq I.V. At rest R only and 12 more subjects received 94 MBq at R and on a second day 124 MBq at peak adenosine stress Adeno n 6 or at peak treadmill exercise Ex n 6 . Physical exam laboratory vital signs ECG and EEG were monitored pre and post injection. Myocardial Myo liver blood pool and lung Standardized Uptake Values SUV were determined from sequential PET images over time. Mean dose for various organs and mean effective dose ED in mSv MBq were estimated.

Results There were no adverse events related to the tracer. The top highest dose organs were kidneys at R and heart with Adeno and Ex. ED was 0.019 at R and with Adeno and 0.015 with Ex. Myo SUV s remained high during imaging. Ex myo SUV was lower with Ex due to higher skeletal muscle uptake. Ex myo SUV was lower with Ex due to higher skeletal muscle uptake. Myo liver was highest with Ex followed by Adeno and R see Table 6 . Myo blood and Myo lung were high and rapidly improved with time.

Studies were performed in subjects to determine dosing protocols for imaging agent 1 under various conditions. Determining dosing protocols included assessing parameters such as mCi of imaging agent 1 injected in the body of the subject mCi of imaging agent 1 injected from the syringe acquisition time of images after injection delay between rest and stress studies etc. Parameters varied for rest and stress for example the injected dose in the body for exercise stress was at least three times the injected dose in the body at rest. In addition the injected dose in the body for pharmacological stress was at least two times the injected does in the body at rest. Results are shown in Table 7.

Various parameters have been determined for dosing imaging agent 1 in human subjects including injected does delay between studies ration of rest to stress dosing and the amount in the syringe compared to the amount injected from the syringe.

The following provides results obtained from a study regarding a single dose dosimetry biodistribution and safety trial of imaging agent 1 in healthy subjects. Whole body PET image data for the 12 healthy volunteers were obtained using imaging agent 1 at approximately 10 minutes 30 minutes 50 minutes 2 hours 2.5 hours 3.83 hours and 4.5 hours post injection. Image data were attenuation corrected at the imaging site and were quantified based on the Medical Internal Radiation Dose MIRD 16 methodology by Dosimetry Analysis Laboratory CDE Dosimetry Services CDE to determine kinetic data in all organs showing significant uptake of activity. Dosimetry estimates were created via kinetic modeling of the quantified image data to determine residence times and the standard MIRD methodology. These estimates were determined using 3 assumptions regarding urinary bladder voiding intervals 2.0 3.5 and 4.8 hr . Kinetic data residence times and the dosimetry estimates are reported for individuals and as summary statistics.

Methods Study population. Healthy adults as determined by medical history physical examination vital signs ECG EEG neurological examination and clinical laboratory testing ages 18 40 years participated in the study. In order to be enrolled subjects had to meet all protocol specified inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.

Study design. This was a non randomized open label single dose study. A total of 13 healthy adult subjects were enrolled and administered a single dose of imaging agent 1 at a single study center in the United States. Subjects were screened within 14 days prior to enrollment to confirm subject eligibility and began baseline assessments at the study center the day before study drug administration. Subjects remained at the study center until completion of the Study Day 2 safety assessments 24 8 hours post dose . A telephone call was made to study subjects 48 8 hours post dose for adverse event AE monitoring. All subjects returned to the study center approximately one week 5 7 days post dose for a follow up safety visit and were contacted by telephone approximately 14 17 days post dose for final serious AE monitoring.

Determination of dose and method of administration. The 8 mCi target dose was selected to provide adequate count statistics and was projected to be well below the maximum acceptable radiation exposure based on preclinical data. These data demonstrated that the maximum dose of imaging agent 1 that may be administered to a human without exceeding 50 mSv 5 rem to the target was 742 MBq 20.0 mCi and the injected dose that yielded an effective dose ED of 10 mSv 1 rem was 666 MBq 18.0 mCi Stabin M G Sparks R B et al OLINDA EXM the second generation personal computer software for internal dose assessment in nuclear medicine. 2005 46 6 1023 7 .

Ann ICRP. 1977 1 3 and the effective dose ED International Commission on Radiological Protection ICRP 1990 Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection 601990 21 1 3 were determined using the OLINDA EXM software Stabin M G Sparks R B et al OLINDA EXM the second generation personal computer software for internal dose assessment in nuclear medicine. 2005 46 6 1023 7 Assessment of radiation dosimetry was based on the MIRD method with data derived from imaging studies using methods consistent with MIRD Pamphlet no. 16 Siegel J A Thomas S R Stubbs J B et al.

The attenuation corrected transverse image data slice planes were combined into a single three dimensional image matrix for each subject and each time point using custom software. These images were then divided into 6 image sets anterior posterior salivary thyroid source and full of combined coronal plane image data for each subject at each time point grouping organs with similar anterior to posterior depths. This was done to optimize the ROI creation and minimize background contribution to the organs contained in each combined coronal plane image. The anterior images contained stomach wall heart wall and urinary bladder. The posterior images contained kidneys lumbar spine and spleen when visible . The salivary images contained the salivary glands parotid and submandibular . The thyroid images contained the thyroid. The full images combined all of the coronal image planes that contained subject image data and was used for quantification of the brain and liver. The source images contained the calibration source.

Regions of interest were drawn around all organs that showed uptake above background using custom software developed and validated for this purpose. Absolute radioactivity was determined by normalizing ROI sums by a calibration factor derived from the calibration source. Region counts were also adjusted for activity containing underlying and overlying tissue that was not part of the organ or tissue being quantified by utilization of background regions of interest. Total body region counts were also corrected for off body background counts. Appropriate normalization of region sizes for organ and adjacent regions were made. Unobstructed regions of organs with significant overlap from other activity containing organs were also employed where necessary. In order to estimate the activity in the lower legs which were not imaged a region of interest on the upper thigh was utilized. Activities were also normalized where necessary to account for 100 of the injected activity and to insure conservative slight over estimates determination of absorbed dose. Where urinary excretion data were available beyond the end of the imaging regimen these data were used to determine whole body retention.

Kinetic data for brain heart wall kidneys liver red marrow lumbar spine regions were utilized salivary glands spleen stomach wall thyroid and urinary bladder for the subjects in the study were determined using image quantification methodology. Absolute activity was converted to fractional dose by dividing by the total activity administered. Organ and tissue data were fit using non linear least squares regression with sums of exponentials of the form shown in Equation 1 where f and X are the model parameters that are determined in the fitting process F t is the fraction of the total injected activity t is the time post injection i is the iROI j is the jsubject and k is the kexponential term. Between one and four exponential terms were employed as appropriate.

The regression was performed using custom software that determines initial parameter values based on the temporal variation of the kinetic data and the use of pre tabulated estimates for various time activity scenarios as selected by the user. Once these data were fit residence times were determined by integration of these empirically determined functions sums of exponentials from time equal zero to infinity taking into account physical decay. Remainder of Body residence times were determined by subtraction of appropriate organ residence times from whole body residence times. Urinary bladder residence times were determined using the parameters determined by fitting the whole body activity data with a urinary bladder model as implemented in the OLINDA EXM software with 3.5 hour bladder voiding interval. Red marrow residence time was determined based on a region of interest drawn on a portion of the lumbar spine. The lumbar spine was assumed to contain 16.1 International Commission on Radiological Protection ICRP Publication 23 Report of the Task Group on Reference Man. Pergamon Press. 1975 page 125 of the total red marrow.

Organ Tissue Dosimetry Estimates. Absorbed dose estimates for all target organs were determined using the OLINDA EXM software using the adult male model. The resulting absorbed dose estimates were scaled based on the total body mass of the individual subjects relative to that of the radiation transport phantom. Salivary gland dosimetry was determined by using a conservative estimate of the S value for salivary glands based on the reference man total mass of the parotid and submaxilary salivary glands International Commission on Radiological Protection ICRP Publication 23 Report of the Task Group on Reference Man. Pergamon Press. 1975 page 125 and assuming a spherical shape. S Values for spheres were produced by the OLINDA EXM software and were linearly scaled based on the relative total body mass of reference man to that of subject. These S values were then multiplied by the residence times to produce final salivary gland dose estimates.

Statistical Analyses. All statistical analyses and all summary tables and listings were prepared using SAS release 9.1.3 SAS Institute Inc. Cary N.C. . Standard descriptive summaries included the N mean median standard deviation SD and or co efficient of variation CV minimum and maximum for continuous variables and the number and percent for categorical variables.

Results Patient demography. Of the 26 subjects who were screened 13 subjects 12 males and one female were administered imaging agent 1 and completed all safety evaluations. The mean age was 23.4 years range 19 34 years and the mean BMI was 23.4 range 20 26 . One patient was not included in the analyses of dosimetry biodistribution and radiokinetics due to the inability to confirm the dose calibrator assay data for the standards preparation.

Radiation dosimetry. The intravenous bolus injection was calculated to deliver no more than 8 mCi of F at the time of injection. The mean SD final decay corrected dose was 6 0.6 mCi of F with a range of 4.6 to 6.6 mCi 170 to 244 MBq . The difference between the target dose and the final dose was due to the retention of imaging agent 1 in the syringe.

The absorbed dose summary statistics are presented in Table 9 mSv MBq . The organ receiving the largest mean absorbed dose was the kidneys at 0.066 mSv MBq 0.24 rem mCi followed by the heart wall at 0.048 mSv MBq 0.18 rem mCi . The mean ED was 0.019 mSv MBq 0.072 rem mCi .

Whole organ biodistribution. The biodistribution of imaging agent 1 calculated as the whole organ percent injected radioactivity as a function of time was determined for brain heart wall kidneys liver lungs red marrow lumbar region salivary glands spleen stomach wall thyroid and urinary bladder Table 10 and . shows whole body coronal images through the body at the level of the myocardium from a representative subject at different time points after administration of imaging agent 1. Images have been corrected for F decay. It can be seen that the heart exhibits high and sustained retention of F from the earliest images through approximately 5 hours after injection. The liver also appears generally exhibiting an intensity similar to that of the heart peaking between 10 and 30 minutes after injection and clearing by approximately 2 hours. The organ that showed the largest mean peak uptake was the liver with approximately 19.1 of the injected activity. The next largest mean peak uptake occurred in the kidneys with approximately 9.4 of the injected activity followed by the brain with approximately 8.3 of the injected activity. Data from subjects in the study were used to determine the urinary excretion rate for each subject and the residence time for radioactivity in the bladder using a standard model with a theoretical fixed voiding interval of 3.5 hours post dose. The largest mean residence times were for remainder tissues 1.8 hours liver 0.28 hours and brain 0.14 hours . Summary residence time statistics are presented in Table 11.

Early elimination of F in urine. Urine collected pre dose Baseline and all voids up to 8 hours post dose were collected and assayed for F. However as in blood collection the urine collection terminated near the 7 hour minimum specified in the protocol. Mean urinary excretion over the approximate 7 hour void interval was 4.83 ID with a CV of 64.7 and a range of 0.64 ID to 12.41 ID. This finding is in reasonable agreement with cumulative urine excretion of 5 as measured with PET imaging.

Discussion The critical organ for imaging agent 1 was the kidneys with a mean estimated dose of 0.066 mSv MBq 0.24 rem mCi The maximum injected dose of the compound that may be administered without exceeding 50 mSv to the critical organ is therefore 770 MBq. This is somewhat higher than the 185 MBq to 370 mBq recommended in the widely used guidance by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research CDER that describes recommended package insert wording for facilities applying to manufacture F FDG PET Drug Applications Content and Format for NDAs and ANDAs Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection Ammonia N 13 Injection Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection Attachment II Sample Formats Labeling for Ammonia N 13 Injection Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection and Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection Attachment II CDER 2000 . This behavior is a result of the very rapid urinary excretion of a large fraction of F FDG shortly after administration resulting in a substantially higher exposure to the urinary bladder for that compound compared with that of imaging agent 1. The ED due to imaging agent 1 0.019 mSv MBq is the same as the ED of F FDG International Commission on Radiological Protection ICRP Radiation Dose to Patients from Radiopharmaceuticals Addendum 2 to ICRP Publication 53 Publication 80 Ann ICRP. 1999 28 3 . It can therefore be concluded that the radiation dose from imaging agent 1 is comparable to or less than that due to F FDG.

Since the mean estimated effective dose ED for imaging agent 1 is 0.019 mSv MBq 0.072 rem mCi the maximum injected dose that may be administered without exceeding 10 mSv ED is therefore 521 MBq.

The radiation dose estimates from this study are consistent with those derived from non human primates Lazewatsky J Azure M Guaraldi M et al.

J Nucl Med. 2009 49 Supplement 1 15p. and the high and sustained retention of imaging agent 1 in the heart is consistent with data in both non human primates and in other species Yu M Guaraldi M T Mistry M Kagan M McDonald J L Drew K Radeke H Purohit A Azure M Casebier D S Robinson S P. BMS 747158 02 a Novel PET Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Agent. Journal Nuclear Cardiology 2007 November December 14 6 789 98 . Although the critical organ in the primate derived estimates was seen to be the heart wall the estimated human radiation dose for the heart wall in that study was 0.067 mSv MBq which is very similar to the critical organ value of 0.066 mSv MBq seen for the kidneys in this study. The doses to both organs were among the highest in both the non human primates derived results and in the current study and are within two standard deviations of one another.

Imaging agent 1 was well tolerated and no clinically significant safety concerns were raised. Changes from baseline in vital signs laboratory values hematology coagulation clinical chemistry and urinalysis ECGs and EEGs were not clinically significant. Potential cardiotoxicity signaled through coagulation studies and changes in Troponin T levels were not exhibited. Physical and neurological examinations did not reveal any pre dose or post dose abnormalities. The DMC did not raise safety concerns following periodic reviews of the safety data.

The results obtained in this study demonstrated that imaging agent 1 appeared to be safe and was well tolerated and exhibited a substantial and sustained retention in myocardium. The critical organ after resting injection of imaging agent 1 was determined to be the kidneys with 0.066 mSv MBq. Based on the observed mean ED the maximum injected dose that may be administered without exceeding 1 rem ED is 14 mCi 521 MBq . The ED from imaging agent 1 is the same as that of F FDG while the critical organ kidney dose of imaging agent 1 is significantly less than the critical organ urinary bladder dose of F FDG.

The following example describes studies relating to cardiac imaging and safety evaluation of imaging agent 1 a novel PET myocardial perfusion imaging agent in chronic myocardial compromised rabbits.

In comparison with single photon emission computer tomography SPECT based agents Tc Sestamibi and Thalium Imaging agent 1 has the advantage of PET technology with accurate attenuation correction and quantification of myocardial perfusion in absolute terms. Furthermore imaging agent 1 heart uptake correlates better with myocardial perfusion at a large range of flow rates invitrol and at rest and stress conditions in vivo Nekolla S G Reder S Saraste A Higuchi T Dzewas G Preissel A et al.

In comparison with current PET agents like N Ammonia and Rubidium the long half life 110 minutes of F enables imaging agent 1 to be radio synthesized and supplied centrally. It also provides the opportunity for imaging under excise stress in addition to pharmacological stress.

Methods Rabbit Model of Myocardial Infarction. Male New Zealand rabbits body weight 2.5 3.5 kg were purchased from Harlan Oakwood Mich. and maintained in the AAALAC accredited Animal Care Facility at Lantheus Medical Imaging. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The procedure of developing a rabbit model of myocardial infarction MI was similar to the method described previously Fujita M Morimoto Y Ishihara M Shimizu M Takase B Maehara T et al. A new rabbit model of myocardial infarction without endotracheal intubation. J Surg Res 2004 116 124 8 . Briefly the rabbit was anesthetized with ketamine 40 mg Kg im and xylazine 9 mg Kg im and placed in a supine position. The surgery was performed under aseptic conditions. A mid sternotomy was performed carefully to avoid injury of parietal pleura. The pericardial sac was exposed and incised. The left ventricular anterior and lateral wall was revealed and a major branch of the left coronary artery was ligated. Success of the ligation was verified by the color change to pale in the affected area of the left ventricular wall. The chest was then closed and the animal allowed to recover. Four weeks after the surgery the rabbit was used for the imaging and cardiovascular evaluation study.

Imaging and Cardiovascular Evaluation. PET images and cardiovascular parameters were evaluated in both normal and MI rabbits. Prior to imaging the rabbit was anesthetized with ketamine 25 mg Kg im and xylazine 5 mg Kg im and the marginal ear vein was catheterized for imaging agent 1 injection. The right femoral artery was isolated and canulated with a Millar catheter SPC340 Millar Instruments Houston Tex. for arterial pressure measurement. Then the animal was positioned in a microPET camera Focus220 CTI Molecular Imaging Inc. Knoxville Tenn. for cardiac imaging. The Millar catheter was connected to a computer driven data acquisition system MP35 BIOPAC Systems Goleta Calif. for recording of mean arterial pressure MAP and systolic and diastolic arterial pressure SAP and DAP . In addition electrocardiogram ECG was also recorded with 3 non invasive limb leads in lead II configuration using the BIOPAC system. Heart rate HR and QT interval were derived from ECG recording. After a stabilization period cardiovascular parameters MAP SBP DBP and ECG were recorded 5 minutes before imaging agent 1 intravenous injection 1.5 mCi and the recording continued for additional 20 minutes post injection. The rabbit was imaged for 30 minutes.

Image Reconstruction and Analysis. After the acquisition images were reconstructed in a matrix of 256 256 pixels with 95 transverse slices using the OSEM2D algorithm and decay corrected microPET Manager and ASIPro CTI Molecular Imaging Inc. Knoxville Tenn. . The pixel size was 0.47 mm and the slice thickness was 0.80 mm. The images were reoriented regarding cardiac axis and serial tomographic cardiac image frames were then generated for a 10 minute period from 20 to 30 minutes. Polar map images were then generated from reconstructed cardiac short axis image using QPS 2008 software Cedars Sinai Medical Center Los Angeles Calif. .

Radiopharmaceutical Agent. The chemical structure and radiosynthesis of imaging agent 1 have been described previously Yu M Guaraldi M T Mistry M Kagan M McDonald J L Drew K et al. a novel PET myocardial perfusion imaging agent. J Nucl Cardiol 2007 14 789 98 and Purohit A Radeke H Azure M Hanson K Benetti R Su F et al. Synthesis and biological evaluation of pyridazinone analogues as potential cardiac positron emission tomography tracers. J Med Chem 2008 51 2954 70 . The radiochemical purity used in this study was 99.1 99.9 and the specific activity was 3265 7016 Ci mmol. The agent was prepared in 5 ethanol v v and 50 mg ml ascorbic acid in water following the clinical protocol.

Data Analysis. Data are expressed as mean SD and unpaired student t test assuming unequal variances was used for comparison of baseline values between control and MI rabbits. p

Results The body weight of control and MI rabbits at the time of study was similar 3.35 0.19 versus 3.06 0.28 kg .

Cardiac Images Representative cardiac short long axis and polar map images of control and MI rabbits are shown in . shows representative cardiac images of imaging agent 1 in control and chronic myocardial infarct MI rabbits. These images were acquired at 20 30 min after imaging agent 1 injection and presented in cardiac short and long axis views and polar maps. Defect areas were clearly identified in the MI rabbit. In the control rabbit the myocardium was clearly visible with uniform distribution of radioactivity and minimal background interference. In the MI rabbit a perfusion defect area in the left ventricular wall was clearly detected in the cardiac short and long axis and polar map views.

ECG Evaluation. As shown in Table 12 baseline ECG tracing before imaging agent 1 injection recorded in lead II configuration showed a normal waveform with positive QRS complexes and T waves in the control rabbit. In contrast the QRS complex and T wave were negative with enlarged Q wave in the MI rabbit. The study obtained ECG tracing before 1 min and 5 min after imaging agent 1 injection in control and myocardial infarct MI rabbits. Table 12 shows baseline values of QTc interval corrected by Fridericia method and averaged changes from the baseline at 1 5 10 and 20 min after imaging agent 1 injection in control and MI rabbits. Similar to control no changes in ECG wave form and QTc interval were observed after injection in MI rabbits.

However the baseline values of QTc and HR Table 12 and Table 13 were comparable in these two groups. Intravenous administration of imaging agent 1 did not alter the ECG waveform cardiac rhythm HR and QTc interval from the baseline values at 1 5 10 and 20 minute post injection in either control or MI rabbits. The study in part showed averaged heart rate HR tracings of control and myocardial infarct MI rabbits 5 min before and 20 min after imaging agent 1 administration. Table 13 shows baseline values of HR and averaged changes from the baseline at 1 5 10 and 20 min after the injection in control and MI rabbits. Similar to control no changes in HR were observed after injection in MI rabbits.

Arterial Pressure Measurement. In contrast to HR and QTc the baseline values of MAP SAP and DAP Table 14 and Table 15 were significantly lower in MI rabbits than in control rabbits. In control rabbits injection of imaging agent 1 did not induce changes in MAP Table 14 SAP and DAP Table 15 . In agreement with the control animal no alterations of these parameters were observed in the MI rabbits during and after administration of imaging agent 1. The study in part demonstrated averaged mean arterial pressure AP tracings of control and myocardial infarct MI rabbits 5 min before and 20 min after imaging agent 1 administration. Table 14 shows baseline values of mean AP and averaged changes from the baseline at 1 5 10 and 20 min after the injection in control and MI rabbits. Similar to control no changes in mean AP were observed after injection in MI rabbits. indicates p

Discussion The study was designed to study imaging agent 1 as a PET imaging agent for evaluation of myocardial perfusion in diagnosis and prognosis of coronary heart disease.

In contrast to ECG waveform in the control rabbit a negative QRS complex with an enlarged Q wave and inverted T wave were observed in lead II configuration in the MI rabbit indicating an abnormal ventricular depolarization and repolarization. Following complete obstruction of a coronary artery branch coronary ligation oxygen carried to the region is reduced or ceased depending on collateral circulation leading to cell death and tissue necrosis. A rapid tissue repair process is then started including initial inflammation followed by angiogenesis increased fibroblast proliferation and collagen production and deposition.

In anesthetized na ve dogs no cardiovascular changes MAP HR left ventricular contractility etc were observed during and after intravenously injection of imaging agent 1 at doses of equal or less than 10 g kg unpublished data . This represents a large safety margin over the maximal clinical imaging agent 1 dose of 0.07 g kg.

In the present study baseline values of MAP SAP and DAP were lower in the MI rabbits than in control rabbits indicating the chronic MI had compromised the cardiovascular system in these rabbits. The dose of imaging agent 1 used for rabbit imaging was in the clinical formulation and approximately 0.5 mCi kg 1.5 mCi in a 3 kg rabbit which is also approximately 3 fold higher than the clinical dose total rest and stress 11 doses 10 mCi in a 60 kg individual . With this dose and in a cardiac compromised condition no change in arterial pressure heart rates and ECG waveform were produced. These findings indicate that imaging with imaging agent 1 is safe even in a cardiac compromised condition.

The results show that cardiac PET imaging with imaging agent 1 detects chronic myocardial infarction fibrosis and scar formation in addition to myocardial ischemia and necrosis under an acute condition. At imaging dose levels imaging agent 1 is safe to be used even in cardiac compromised condition at least in rabbits.

The following example describes brain imaging of imaging agent 1 and evaluation of the blood brain barrier permeability in rats. PET imaging in animals and humans indicate this compound crosses the normal blood brain bather BBB and can image CNS disease. Studies to date have not assessed how effectively imaging agent 1 crosses the BBB. The present studies compared brain uptake in rats in the presence and absence of BBB disruption.

Methods Male Sprague Dawley rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and the left external carotid artery was cannulated close to the internal and external carotid bifurcation. Using saline as control and 25 D mannitol as hypertonic solution each were perfused retrogradely in six animals 0.3 mL kg sec for 30 seconds. Two minutes later 1 mCi imaging agent 1 was injected via tail vein and the brain was imaged with a microPET camera for 30 minutes. Evans blue 2 5 mL kg was also injected intravenously and only animals demonstrating clear BBB disruption by Evans blue staining were included in the study. Following completion of imaging the brain was harvested photographed and dissected into left and right hemispheres and cerebellum. The tissue content of imaging agent 1 radioactivity was measured by gamma counter and Evans blue levels were determined by fluorescence method for calculation of the injected dose gram tissue and g Evan blue gram tissue respectively.

Results See Table 16. Infusion of 25 D mannitol resulted in a marked increase in Evans blue uptake in the left hemisphere 633 and some increased uptake in the right hemisphere 216 and cerebellum 186 compared to saline control. In normal rats and saline infused control rats a high level of imaging agent 1 accumulated in the brain shortly after administration. PET imaging showed this high uptake of imaging agent 1 in saline control rats was only minimally increased in brain region following BBB disruption.

Imaging agent 1 has a high BBB permeability that is only minimally increased following disruption and may be used for brain imaging.

The following example is related to F labeled imaging agent 1 PET myocardial perfusion imaging detecting more severe and extensive stress induced myocardial ischemia than Tc 99m Sestamibi SPECT. In this study rest stress Tc 99m Sestamibi SPECT and imaging agent 1 PET MPI were compared for evaluation of stress induced myocardial perfusion abnormalities.

Methods Thirteen patients from a single center underwent rest stress Tc 99m Sestamibi SPECT MPI rest stress imaging agent 1PET MPI and coronary angiography. In each patient 17 myocardial segments were visually scored for rest and stress images by independent observers who were blinded to all other results. For each patient summed stress scores SSS summed rest scores SRS and summed difference scores SDS were determined from segmental scores. Percent narrowing in each coronary artery was evaluated blindly and 70 luminal diameter narrowing was considered significant.

Results There were 15 diseased coronary arteries 7 left anterior descending 5 left circumflex and 3 right coronary arteries. In myocardial segments that were supplied by diseased coronary arteries SSS and SDS were significantly higher by PET than SPECT Table 17 .

These data showed that as compared to Sestamibi SPECT rest stress F labeled imaging agent 1 PET MPI demonstrated more severe and extensive stress induced perfusion abnormalities in myocardial regions that are supplied by diseased coronary arteries.

The following example describes a comparison of myocardial stress perfusion defect assessment using Tc sestamibi SPECT versus imaging agent 1 PET. Myocardial uptake of imaging agent 1 exhibits a stronger relationship with myocardial blood flow across the range of achievable flow than Tc sestamibi.

Methods and Results Twenty six patients 20 men underwent SPECT and PET within 6 months. PET was performed with imaging agent 1 at rest 2.3 3.9 mCi followed 60 min n 18 or 24 h n 8 later with exercise n 16 or adenosine n 10 stress 7.3 8.6 mCi . Image quality of SPECT and PET was consensually assessed by 2 independent blinded readers and graded as excellent good or fair. Stress and rest perfusion defects on SPECT and PET were assessed by the same readers by computer assisted visual interpretation using the standard 17 segment 5 point scoring model 0 normal 4 absent uptake . The extent and severity of ischemia summed difference score SDS was derived from the difference between summed stress SSS and summed rest scores SRS . Image quality with PET was excellent in 24 and good in 2 patients. In contrast there were 7 excellent 18 good and 1 fair quality study p4 mean SDS was greater with PET than with SPECT 9.6 1.8 vs. 5.4 0.7 p 0.02 . In all 12 patients with normal SPECT SSS 

Compared to Tc sestamibi SPECT imaging agent 1 PET provides better image quality and results in a significant increase in the SDS in patients with abnormal SPECT. These results showed that PET imaging with imaging agent 1 provided better assessment of the magnitude of myocardial ischemia than SPECT.

The study examined whether retention and SUV calculations were also suitable for the assessment of coronary flow reserve CFR in a pig model.

Methods Nine pigs were subjected to dynamic PET imaging of 100 200 MBq imaging agent 1 at rest and stress. MBF was evaluated using both imaging agent 1 PET 3 compartmental modeling and the co injected microspheres. Retention was calculated as uptake between 5 10 and 10 20 min divided by the integral under the input function. Standard SUV calculation for the same time points was also used.

Results MBF ranged from 0.5 2.8 mL min g Both retention and SUV showed good correlation with both imaging agent 1 and microsphere MBF 5 10 min r 0.69 p

Using imaging agent 1 a simplified kinetic analysis model for the assessment of MBF index and CFR was feasible. Furthermore SUV derived values were suitable for tracer injection outside the imaging device and allowed for a physical stress test. These results provided a basis for a simplified quantitative approach in the routine clinical setting.

The following describes remote camera qualification RCQ of PET and PET CT scanners for imaging agent 1 myocardial perfusion using a standardized phantom procedure.

As will be known to those of ordinary skill in the art in a medical imaging clinical trial camera qualification is a critical step in assessing whether individual clinical site CS possesses the capability to execute the protocol. In some cases a challenge lies in how to standardize a task specific phantom and the associated qualification procedure that can effectively determine if specific site scanners meet the study requirement to join the trial.

Methods. Using various cameras the RCQ procedure with an imaging manual customized for each scanner model utilized step by step instruction for CS to follow. A low cost standardized phantom using a 2 liter soda bottle with an acrylic rod L 21 cm D 2 cm sealed inside the cap was provided to each CS see Example 42 for more details . CS injected 3 4 mCi F18 solution to the water filled phantom to acquire image data and to test existing cardiac misregistration MR correction software in each system. The RCQ procedure was performed by the CS with telephone support as necessary. All image data was sent to the imaging core laboratory to analyze in terms of quantitative imaging parameters. Minimum performance criteria were established to identify cameras whose performance was inconsistent with accepted norms. The results are shown in Table 18.

Conclusions. Remote camera qualification when integrated with a standardized phantom comprehensive imaging manuals full technical support and centralized data analysis can be a cost effective and efficient method to assess the performance of PET and PET CT scanners in a large clinical trial.

Standardization and harmonization of imaging methodology and scanner performance is critical to the success of clinical studies using PET e.g. as described in Example 41 . Generally this may be accomplished with a test object called a phantom that is loaded with an appropriate quantity of radioactive material and imaged in the same way with each scanner. Phantoms may be constructed either of solid materials with long lived positron emitters embedded or they may be filled with water and short lived radioactivity added as needed. Differences in observed imaging performance allow adjustment of methods or repair of equipment as necessary to assure uniformity of image quality among all systems used. Conventional phantoms both solid and refillable are sufficiently expensive that the cost of simultaneous assessment at a large number of sites is prohibitive. The device described in this example is a simple task specific phantom for cardiac PET using readily available materials that can be constructed for approximately 1 the price of a conventional refillable phantom. When combined with routine quality control it allows the simultaneous characterization of a large number of PET and PET CT systems for standardization in PET cardiac clinical trials.

Materials and Methods. The phantom was constructed from a standard 2 liter soda bottle. A rod of acrylic plastic 8 inches long and inches in diameter was centered and fixed to the inside of the cap of the bottle using an external screw. The surface between the end of the rod and the inside of the cap and under the screw head was sealed with glue appropriate to the materials prior to final tightening of the screw and the phantom tested for leakage.

The following example describes a comparison of imaging agent 1 and 18F fluorodeoxyglucose FDG for assessment of left ventricular viability following myocardial infarction in rats.

Methods. MI was induced in rats by 30 minutes of coronary occlusion followed reperfusion. Imaging agent 1 1 mCi and FDG 1 mCi cardiac imaging in 2 days apart was performed in rats of before two days early MI and four weeks late MI post surgery. A regimen of glucose and insulin was injected before FDG imaging to ensure high cardiac uptake. Viable left ventricle was quantified in images as the volume with 50 of maximum activity.

Results. In control rats cardiac imaging with both imaging agent 1 and FDG showed well defined left ventricular wall and the left ventricular volume was measured as 1.17 0.04 and 1.11 0.07 cm3 respectively before surgery. In early and late stage MI rats the myocardial defect area was clearly identified by imaging with both agents. The viable left ventricular tissue volume measured with imaging agent 1 was slightly larger than the viable tissue area measured with FDG 0.94 0.01 vs. 0.75 0.04 and 1.18 0.04 vs. 0.99 0.09 cm3 at early and late stage MI . In addition imaging agent 1 imaging showed similar detectable left ventricular areas at 20 and 80 minutes post injection no refill in in both early and late stage MI. This example shows that imaging agent 1 has the potential to be used to assess myocardial viability like FDG however without the need for insulin pre treatment.

The following demonstrates that a quantitative and perceived defect severity are proportional with imaging agent 1 PET myocardial perfusion imaging.

In order to identify the minimum rest dose of imaging agent 1 a comparison was made between the count related variation in normal myocardium and the minimum change in defect severity that would result in 50 probability of a reader s changing a segmental score by 1. In order to determine this limiting change in defect severity a comparison was made between reader scores from a blinded read and the corresponding quantitative defect severity.

Method. Patients selected for one or more at least partially reversible defects on SPECT studies were evaluated as part the first cohort in the Phase 2 study of imaging agent 1. Rest and stress images were read by a panel of three blinded readers. Reader scores using a 17 segment model from the rest image data only derived from the first 20 patients were compared with the percentage decreases from the maximum value in each image as calculated by standard cardiac MPI analysis software Cedars QPS . The values were plotted and a linear regression calculated for the data from each reader see .

Results. Although there was significant range in quantitative severity values at each reader score value SD 20 of image maximum the data was well modeled with the simple linear regression resulting in Rvalues of 1.00 0.978 and 0.984 for readers 1 2 and 3 respectively. The intercept values were 84.18 82.33 and 84.96 respectively while the slopes were 13.8 9.86 and 8.53 respectively.

Discussion. These results suggest that at least with imaging agent 1 it may be possible to estimate reader responses using a simple linear relationship and the quantitative fraction of the maximum value without the need for a normal database. Based on a mean slope of 10.7 it was estimated that a 50 probability of a change of 1 in reader score corresponded to a change in quantitative severity by 5.4 

The following examples describes a comparison of imaging agent 1 and Tc 99m labeled SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging for identifying severity and extent of stress induced myocardial ischemia in Phase 2 clinical trials

In this multi center Phase 2 study imaging agent 1 and Tc 99m labeled SPECT rest stress MPI were compared for evaluation of stress induced myocardial perfusion abnormalities in patients Pts with coronary artery disease CAD .

Methods 84 Pts from 21 centers presenting with an intermediate to high CAD pre test likelihood underwent rest stress Tc 99m labeled SPECT MPI imaging agent 1 PET MPI and coronary angiography. Their mean age was 64.5 years range 36 85 and 68 were males. In each patient 17 myocardial segments were visually scored on rest and stress images by 3 independent blinded readers. For each pt summed difference scores SDS were determined from segmental scores. Percent narrowing in each coronary artery was quantitatively and blindly determined and 50 luminal diameter narrowing was considered significant. Of the 84 Pts 52 had CAD and 32 had insignificant CAD normal coronary arteries.

Results. There were 105 diseased coronary arteries in 52 patients 40 left anterior descending 30 left circumflex and 35 right coronary arteries. In patients with at least one diseased artery the mean SD PET SDS score ranged among the three readers from 6.8 5.75 to 9.4 7.51 and the mean SD SPECT SDS score ranged from 4.1 4.75 to 5.7 6.51 . The differences in SDS scores between PET and SPECT were statistically significant in all readers p

Conclusions. These data suggest that as compared to Tc 99m SPECT rest stress imaging agent 1 PET MPI demonstrates more severe and extensive stress induced perfusion abnormalities in myocardial regions that are supplied by diseased coronary arteries.

The following example describes a Phase 2 clinical comparison of imaging agent 1 injection PET and Tc 99m labeled SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging for diagnosis of coronary artery disease.

In the Phase 2 study the clinical safety of imaging agent 1 injection was evaluated and its diagnostic performance for detection of coronary artery disease CAD was compared to rest stress Tc 99m labeled SPECT MPI.

Methods. 143 patients Pts from 21 centers presenting with a broad spectrum of CAD pre test likelihoods underwent rest stress Tc 99m labeled SPECT MPI and imaging agent 1 PET MPI. 84 143 who had an intermediate to high CAD likelihood underwent coronary angiography. Their mean age was 64.5 range 36 85 years and 68 were males. narrowing in each coronary artery was quantified blindly. 52 84 Pts had significant CAD 50 luminal diameter narrowing and 32 84 had insignificant CAD normal coronary arteries. In each patient 17 myocardial segments were visually scored on rest and stress images by 3 independent blinded readers and majority rule interpretation was determined in each patient for both PET and SPECT studies. Diagnostic performance of PET was compared to that of SPECT using ROC analysis.

Results. A significantly higher of images were rated as either excellent or good on PET vs SPECT stress images 99.2 vs. 88.8 p

Conclusions. Within this Phase 2 clinical trial imaging agent 1 appeared to be safe and superior to Tc 99m labeled SPECT with respect to image quality certainty of image interpretation and overall diagnosis of CAD.

The following described a streamlined quantification of absolute myocardial blood flow at rest and stress with imaging agent 1 injection PET in normal subjects and patients with coronary artery disease.

Objectives. The feasibility of streamlined quantification of rest R and stress S myocardial blood flows MBFs and coronary flow reserve CFR with imaging agent 1 for clinical use in normal subjects and coronary artery disease CAD patients Pts was evaluated.

Methods. Ten Pts 6 with a low likelihood of CAD and 4 with CAD 50 stenosis and reversible defects received imaging agent 1 injection at Rand at peak adenosine S followed by 10 min dynamic acquisition. The R S imaging protocol was same day in 5 Pts and separate day in 5 Pts. Rand S polar maps were automatically generated from summed dynamic scans 0.5 2 min post injection and the 3 coronary territories LAD RCA LCX and the left ventricular blood pool LV were defined automatically. Reversible defects were manually assigned on the polar maps from which time activity curves TACs were generated. A single compartment model that included an irreversible uptake constant K and a spillover from blood pool activity was used to fit the tissue TACs at early times 0 2 min . LV TAC was used as the input function. Recovery coefficient due to partial volume effect of myocardium was estimated as 1 spf with spf denoting the blood spillover fraction determined from model fitting. The first pass extraction fraction for imaging agent 1 in humans was assumed to be 0.94 equivalent to that observed in pre clinical studies. CFR was calculated as S R MBF.

Results. MBF and CFR were compared between 18 normal territories in 6 low likelihood Pts and 5 reversible defect territories which were supplied by CAD coronaries Table 19 p

Conclusions. Quantification of MBF using imaging agent 1 injection PET myocardial perfusion imaging can be streamlined in clinical applications to give robust MBF results.

A solution of imaging agent precursor 1 0.521 g 1.00 mmol in dry acetone 10.0 mL was treated with LiBr 0.261 g 3.00 mmol in one portion at 22 C. then warmed to 56 C. and maintained 2.5 h. The now heterogeneous reaction mixture was cooled to ambient temperature and all volatiles removed in vacuo. The crude product was then purified by chromatography on silica 30 190 mm using 3 1 pentane EtOAc. The main product peak eluting 180 360 mL was collected pooled and concentrated in vacuo to a colorless oil. Final purification through recrystallization from warm EtOAc and pentane afforded a white crystalline solid 0.369 g 0.859 mmol 85.9 .

Three two component syringes Henke Sass Wolf as well as three three component syringes Becton and Dickinson were each filled with a 1 mL solution of imaging agent 1 

To further identify the contact surface material that contributed to syringe retention of imaging agent 1 three additional B D syringes were each filled with a 1 mL solution of imaging agent 1 then maintained at ambient temperature and humidity for a period of three hours. Following transfer of the individual doses as described in Example 1 the syringe barrel and butyl rubber tip plunger were then separated measured for retained radioactivity and decay corrected. The values of percent retained radioactivity for each syringe component are summarized in Table 21. The difference in percent retained activity is statistically significant at the 95 confidence level i.e. Prob t 0.0017 .
