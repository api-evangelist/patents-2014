This application is a divisional of application Ser. No. 13 773 094 filed on Feb. 21 2013 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 742 111 which is commonly assigned.

The invention described herein may be manufactured used and or licensed by or for the United States Government.

The invention is directed to a new synthesis of an intermediate anilino methyl ester which is employed in the synthesis of Carfentanil Sufentanil Alfentanil and Remifentanil.

4 Anilidopiperidine analgesics developed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals are a class of clinically important synthetic opiates. These include Carfentanil Sufentanil Alfentanil and Remifentanil.

The syntheses of these compounds have been disclosed in the patent and open literature. A partial general synthetic scheme is shown below.

With R PhCH commercially available 1 benzyl 4 piperidinone is subjected to a Strecker reaction with aniline to form an amino nitrile. The conversion of the nitrile group to the methyl ester occurs as follows. The nitrile is converted to an amide under strongly acidic conditions. The amide is then converted to a carboxylic acid under strongly basic conditions. The resulting acid is then converted to the intermediate anilino methyl ester either via carboxylic acid or its sodium salt. The intermediate anilino methyl ester can be transformed after numerous divergent steps into Carfentanil Sufentanil Alfentanil or Remifentanil.

With R PhCHCH the yield of the hydrolysis of the nitrile under high acidic conditions e.g. sulfuric acid to the corresponding amide is very low about 14 or less . Non acidic conditions also yield less than satisfactory results.

In U.S. Pat. No. 5 106 983 Reiff et al. 4 anilidopiperidine analgesics as above described are produced by the series of reactions as noted above including a Strecker synthesis to give an aminonitrile and the nitrile is then converted to a formamide with formic acid and acetic anhydride. This compound is hydrolyzed to an imidate with refluxing methanolic hydrogen chloride. Decomposition of this in dilute base gives an amide. The net yield for these three steps which substitutes for the acid hydrolysis of the nitrile is about 47 . This three step procedure to replace the sulfuric acid hydrolysis is tedious.

It is an object of this invention to provide an improved process for synthesis of 4 anilidopiperidine analgesics and in particular an improved method for synthesizing certain intermediates of such synthesis.

It has been found that the conversion of the aminonitrile to the corresponding amide can be improved by substituting a portion of the sulfuric acid with a weaker more volatile acid. The synthesis also employs a cyclizing reagent and spiro intermediate in the transformation of the amide into the intermediate aniline methyl ester.

This invention relates to the synthesis of 4 anilidopiperidine analgesics such as Carfentanil Sufentanil Alfentanil and Remifentanil and in particular to the intermediates used in forming such compounds. The new synthesis of the intermediates is shown below. The first reaction is a Strecker reaction between 1 benzyl 4 piperidinone with aniline to form an aminonitrile 1 . The nitrile is then converted to the amide 2 with a mixture of an organic acid and a non aqueous inorganic acid e.g. trifluoroacetic acid and sulfuric acid via indirect acid catalyzed hydration. The organic acid acts as an acidic solvent. Sulfuric acid can be replaced with methanesulfonic acid. Molar ratios of the sulfuric acid to the organic acid will range from about 1 10 to 1 2 with about 1 4 being preferred. The amide 2 is cyclized to a 2 4 diaza 4 oxo cyclopentane piperidine 3 . A particularly useful cyclizing agent is dimethylformamide dimethoxy acetal. The 2 4 diaza 4 oxo cyclopentane piperidine 3 is converted to the corresponding methyl ester 4 by reaction with sulfuric acid in methanol.

The invention is a new conversion of anilino nitrile to the aniline methyl ester not seen in the patent or open literature. The advantages of this transformation are conversion of nitrile to the amide with a better process in the N phenylmethyl or N phenethyl piperidine series. The transformation from amide to the spiro intermediate provides a milder alternative than the conversion of the amide to carboxylic acid seen in the literature. The reaction does not require strongly basic conditions and the work up and purifications are more efficient and simpler. The conversions of the spiro intermediates to the aniline methyl esters are also very efficient and mild.
