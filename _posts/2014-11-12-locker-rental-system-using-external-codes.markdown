title: Locker rental system using external codes
abstract: A locker rental system includes electronic lockers centrally managed by a locker manager. The locker manager is in communication with a separate external system, which handles admissions and sales for a venue. Users are provided with a unique external identification (ID) code for purposes such as admission to the venue. Determinative sequences of the external ID codes are provided to the locker manager as validation codes. When the external ID code is scanned, the locker manager validates the external ID code using the validation codes. A valid external ID code may be used to rent and access lockers in the locker system. In some implementations, locker rights may be sold through the external system and details of the transaction provided to the locker manager. If the external ID code is valid, the locker manager generates a rental plan.

Some venues e.g. amusement parks theme parks water parks etc. make lockers available to guests. The lockers may be used to store possessions while the guest is visiting the venue. In some instances guests may use lockers on an ad hoc basis. For example an amusement park may provide complimentary short term single re entry lockers to store backpacks cameras concessions and other carried items while guests are on a ride where such items are not permitted. In other instances guests may choose to rent a locker for an extended period to store items as a convenience. For example water park guests may rent a locker with no re entry restrictions in order to have a secure place to store clothes towels keys purses wallets phones snacks or other items left unattended while enjoying the water park attractions. Unrestricted re entry allows guests the freedom to access the encoded items as needed throughout the day e.g. to obtain a dry towel or money to buy food .

Controlling access to lockers in large high traffic venues presents unique challenges. Venue lockers particularly those with short term specific purpose locker rights e.g. ride lockers have high turnover and are used by an ever changing assortment of guests. Issuing temporary physical keys e.g. wristbands keycards etc. to guests adds to the venue overhead in a high turnover environment. Biometric access systems e.g. fingerprint scanning and other keyless technologies are more complex and inconsistent scans issues may leave guests unable to retrieve stored items. It is with respect to these and other considerations that the present invention has been made.

According to some aspects of the disclosure a locker rental system includes electronic lockers centrally managed by a locker manager. The locker manager may be in communication with a separate external system which handles admissions and sales for a venue. Users are already provided with a unique or semi unique external identification ID code for purposes other than locker rentals such as admission to the venue. The locker rental system allows these external ID codes to be used for locker access. Further the locker rental system allows the external system to initiate the sale of locker rights linked to external ID codes.

The locker rental system includes the locker manager one or more locker terminals and one or more lockers. Each locker is in communication with the locker manager via a locker terminal. The locker manager provides locker management functionality including but not limited to authenticating requests to access lockers associating external ID codes with locker rights tracking locker usage and optionally sending signals or messages controlling access to lockers e.g. unlocking lockers .

The locker terminal generally provides a local user interface for accessing lockers. Aspects of the locker terminal include a code entry device. A locker is accessed by scanning or manually entering the external ID code using the code entry device. The locker terminal request access to a locker by sending the external ID code and other pertinent to the locker manager. If authorization is received from the locker manager the locker terminal selectively unlocks the lock of the authorized locker.

The locker manager stores a listing of locker accounts purchased or otherwise activated by users. Each locker account is configured to store information relating to the acquired locker rights. As lockers are rented the locker manager associates user accounts with locker accounts to define rental plans. Each rental plan includes at least one locker account. In some implementations the locker manager stores a listing of validation codes against which external ID codes may be compared to verify that the external ID code is authorized for use by the locker manager.

The external system is able to initiate the sale of locker rights based on external ID codes allowing revenue to be tracked in real time on the external system. The external system interfaces with the locker rental system to cause the creation of locker rights linked to the external ID codes. Once the sale transaction is completed users may immediately utilize the external ID codes to access lockers via the locker rental system.

The external ID code is any unique or semi unique identifier associated with the external system that is normally provided to users for purposes other than to access the locker rental system. Initially discriminative sequences within the external ID codes are identified and stored as validation codes which may be used to verify that an external ID code is genuine. The external ID codes are issued to users on encoded items and have specific functionality in the external system.

The external system receives the external ID code for example via a point of sale terminal. The point of sale terminal determines if the external ID code is supplied in conjunction with a request for locker rights. If locker rights are requested the point of sale terminal sends an activation request to the locker manager. The locker manager determines that the external ID code is valid and optionally that the requested locker rights are allowed for that external ID code. If valid the locker manager activates the external ID codes user accounts and or the locker accounts. Activation may include linking the external ID codes or user accounts with the locker accounts in a rental plan. The locker manager notifies the external system that the external ID code has been activated in the locker rental system. After receiving notice the external system completes the locker right sale transaction and updates the records of the external system.

Some implementations of the locker rental system may allow use of external ID codes without a sale of locker rights initiated by the external system. For example a venue may provide complimentary locker usage to users in certain situations with access to an external ID code. To access a complimentary locker a user enters the external ID code at the locker terminal providing local control of one or more electronic lockers. If the external ID code has not been activated for use in the locker rental system the locker terminal may generate an activation request causing the locker manager to attempt to activate the external ID code and or the requested locker rights.

Following activation an access request causes the locker manager to determine if the requested access is in accordance with a rental plan associated with the external ID code. The locker manager retrieves any relevant rental plans by comparing the external ID code in the access request to the external ID codes or user accounts associated with the rentals plans. The locker manager then evaluates the properties of the relevant locker accounts against the information supplied in the access request or obtained generally. If the access request satisfies a relevant rental plan the locker manager authorizes access to the locker. If access is approved but a locker has not been selected or previously assigned the locker manager selects an appropriate locker and associates the locker identifier for the selected locker with the locker account. Finally upon receipt of authorization from the locker manager the locker terminal unlocks the assigned locker allowing the user to store or retrieve items.

A locker rental system includes electronic lockers centrally managed by a locker manager. The locker manager is in communication with a separate external system which handles admissions and sales for a venue. Users are provided with a unique external identification ID code for purposes such as admission to the venue. Determinative sequences of the external ID codes are provided to the locker manager as validation codes. When an external ID code is scanned the locker manager validates the external ID code using the validation codes. A valid external ID code may be used to rent and access lockers in the locker system. In some implementations locker rights may be sold through the external system and details of the transaction provided to the locker manager. If the external ID code is valid the locker manager associates the locker rights with the external ID code.

The locker rental system includes the locker manager one or more locker terminals and one or more lockers . Each locker is in communication with the locker manager via a locker terminal . Multiple lockers may be grouped together in a locker bank and controlled by a single locker terminal . Individual lockers may have their own dedicated locker terminal .

The locker manager provides locker management functionality including but not limited to authenticating requests to access lockers associating external ID codes with locker rights tracking locker usage and optionally sending signals or messages controlling access to lockers e.g. unlocking lockers .

The locker terminal generally provides a local user interface for accessing lockers . The locker terminal is responsible for communications with and is responsive to the locker manager . In some implementations the locks are remotely controlled by or in response to commands from the locker manager via the locker terminal i.e. a host client relationship . In other implementations each locker terminal locally manages access to the associated locker s based on centralized information obtained by the locker terminal from the locker manager and notifies the locker manager about locker transactions to keep the centralized information current i.e. a peer relationship .

Optional locker rental system kiosks allow users to rent lockers directly from the locker rental system . In some implementations the locker rental system kiosks dispense an encoded item with a unique or semi unique locker access code . For example the locker access code may be a barcode printed on a wristband.

As previously mentioned the illustrated implementation shows the locker rental system in communication with a representative external system that does not provide locker rental management. By way of a non limiting example a venue e.g. a theme park or an amusement park may operate an external access control system that provides centralized monitoring management hosting accounting and control of various aspects of the venue operations such as park admission via admission turnstiles and vending via point of sale POS terminals . Other types of external systems may provide more or less functionality. Another example of an external system is a hotel operating a registration system that manages access to rooms via electronic keycards assigned to hotel guests.

The locker manager is configured to utilize the unique or semi unique external ID codes provided to users for purposes other than locker rental and optionally the locker access codes . The external ID codes are often associated with encoded items such as without limitation admission tickets keycards wristbands identification cards and passes provided to users. The encoded item may be provided either physically e.g. a printed ticket or electronically e.g. an e ticket displayable using a mobile phone or tablet . The external ID codes may be written to or on the encoded items in a machine readable format a human readable format or both e.g. stored as a digital code or printed as a barcode .

Various implementations of the locker rental system and or the external system provide various ways for users to rent lockers. Some implementations may allow users to rent lockers and or redeem locker rental vouchers at selected external e.g. venue operated point of sale terminals . Examples of suitable point of sale terminals include but are not limited to vendor operated and self service transaction terminals located at stores and kiosks around the venue. The point of sale terminals and or the external access control system may run a vending module or other software component to handle locker rights sale transactions. The point of sale terminals may communicate transaction details e.g. the locker rights acquired to the locker manager directly as indicated by the broken double line or indirectly via the external access control system . For example the locker manager may expose an application programming interface API or a communication protocol that allows the external access control system and or the point of sale terminals to request activation of external ID codes in the locker manager and notify the locker manager of new or modified locker rights associated with active external ID codes . In some implementations the locker terminals may also provide point of sale terminal functionality and may communicate transaction details e.g. payment information to the external access control system either directly as indicated by the broken double line or indirectly through the locker manager . Some implementations allow locker rights to be purchased from a website e.g. the venue website hosted by a web e commerce server associated with the locker rental system and or the external system via the Internet or other network using a client device e.g. a laptop computer tablet or smartphone .

Consider the case of a theme park offering complimentary ride lockers to all guests for certain rides. The nominal cost to provide a wristband with a locker access code to each guest who utilizes the ride lockers is between 0.03 and 0.07 per wristband and is in addition to the cost of the park admission ticket. However by utilizing the locker rental system described herein to provide locker access using the external ID code on the park admission ticket the theme park can provide locker rights to users without the additional recurring supply cost. Alternatively rather than issuing locker access codes to all guests the external access code may be used to issue encoded items to only those users who desire a locker.

The external ID code is any unique or semi unique identifier associated with an external system . External ID code may be alphabetic numeric alphanumeric and may vary in length. External ID codes are provided to users for any purpose other than to access the locker rental system . In some instances the entire external ID code is predetermined and the validation codes may be complete external ID codes . In some instances only a base portion of the external ID code is predetermined and the validation codes are the base portions of external ID codes . In other words external ID codes may include fixed code sequences a prefix a suffix and or a mid portion common to blocks of external ID codes together with a unique code sequence. By way of a non limiting example an amusement park admission ticket may have a 26 digit code with a non unique or semi unique six digit prefix followed by a unique 20 digit code. In other instances the external ID codes generated by the external system are sequential codes non duplicative random or pseudo random codes or other unique or semi unique codes generated on demand where the external ID codes themselves do not contain any predetermined or otherwise distinct portion but have other characteristics e.g. code length or pattern that may be used to authenticate the external ID codes .

Typically the external ID code is in the form of a machine readable code suitable for automated entry to make high volume authentication convenient and efficient. For example the external ID code may be encoded in various machine readable forms including but not limited to a barcode a magnetic strip and a radio frequency identification tag. However a human readable code entered manually is also suitable for use with the method described herein. Likewise a combination of automated and manual entry e.g. a machine readable external ID code used with a manually entered pin may also be used for example to provide an additional layer of security.

Moreover different external ID codes may have different locker access rights or capabilities. For example the theme park may offer an admission ticket upgrade or a special pass that allows guests to use an express line with reduced wait times. The external ID codes associated with the upgraded admission ticket or special pass may also be linked to additional locker rights e.g. upgraded ride lockers or complimentary general use lockers . Similarly key cards from select hotels may be used to provide guests with complimentary general use lockers at a nearby theme park and or to rent lockers at the hotel pool.

As previously mentioned some implementations offer the ability to purchase upgraded or add additional locker rights from the external system i.e. using the park s existing external access control system . Because point of sale terminals are typically plentiful and easy to locate in a theme park the locker rental system described herein allows the venue to make purchasing locker rental rights convenient for guests.

The ability to access lockers using an external ID code does not depend upon the ability to purchase upgraded or additional locker rights from the external system . In implementations where the sale of locker rights is not available through the external system park visitors may choose to rent a locker and receive a locker access code issued by the locker rental system . However even when the external system cannot be used to purchase locker rights on site external ID codes may still be used to access lockers using predetermined e.g. complimentary lockers and or pre purchased locker rights.

The locker manager locker terminals locker rental system kiosks the external access control system and other components of the locker rental system and the external system are in communication via one or more private networks e.g. wide area networks or local area networks or direct electrical connections. In a typical example the various components of the locker rental system and the external system are linked over a wired or wireless communication network. Additionally components of the locker rental system and the external system may be hardwired together using cables or electrical wires. In some implementations the locker rental system is on a separate network from the external system . In other words the locker terminals and other locker rental system may be exclusively in communication with the locker manager while the venue point of sale terminals other external system components may be exclusively in communication with the external access control system and the locker manager and the external access control system are linked or otherwise in communication to provide a bridge between the two networks. In various implementations selected components are connected to both networks. For example a locker terminal or a vendor point of sale may be linked to both the locker manager for access control and the external access control system for purchasing locker rights.

It is not necessary that the locker rental system and the external system be in direct communication. For example a guest registration system from an affiliated hotel may not be in direct communication with a locker rental system in an amusement park. Instead information from the guest registration system may be transferred through an intermediary and loaded into the locker rental system allowing the locker manager to recognize external ID codes read from hotel keycards.

The locker manager the external access control system the client device and other components such as locker terminals kiosks and point of sale terminals may be implemented in whole or in part as specific purpose computing devices including at least a processor memory and a communication interface e.g. a wired or wireless network interface . Such computing devices may optionally include a user interface having one or more input devices e.g. keypads or touchscreens and or one or more output devices e.g. video displays or speakers as necessary. For example the locker manager and the external access control system may be implemented as servers. The components of the locker rental system and the external system may be implemented in independent distributed architectures. The distributed components may be in communication over one or more networks such as but not limited to local area networks wide area networks or the Internet via appropriate communication interfaces.

In the illustrated implementation the locker terminal includes a communication interface a processor memory and a code entry device . The communication interface allows the locker manager to communicate with other devices and systems such as but not limited to the locker manager . The processor and memory cooperatively store and execute machine instructions to provide the functionality of the locker terminal described herein.

The code entry device reads or scans a machine readable external ID code from the encoded item or allows users to manually enter a human readable external ID code or an additional security code such as a personal identification number PIN . Examples of suitable code entry devices for reading machine readable external ID codes include but are not limited to barcode readers magnetic strip readers radio frequency identification tag readers scanners and cameras. Examples of suitable code entry devices for entering human readable external ID codes include without limitation keypads keyboards and touchscreens. Various implementation of the locker terminal include additional input devices which may be used for entry of additional information relating to a locker transaction such as a locker number or payment information. Examples of additional input devices include without limitation keypads keyboards touchpads touchscreens credit card readers and microphones.

A locker is accessed by scanning or manually entering the external ID code from the encoded item using the code entry device . The locker communicates with the locker manager to determine whether access to the locker is authorized. If authorization is received from the locker manager the locker terminal selectively unlocks the lock of the assigned locker .

In some implementations the locker terminal includes one or more optional output devices via which information may be presented to users. Various implementations employ visual indicators e.g. display screens or lamps and or audio output transducers e.g. speakers depending upon the types and amount of information to be conveyed.

Display screens may be used to visually communicate written or pictorial information about the locker bank and or individual lockers such as the number of available lockers usage instructions the location of the available lockers and the status of one or more lockers . Some implementations provide information such as the number and location of available lockers only for the lockers associated with the locker terminal . In some implementations display screens may be used to provide information about other locker banks . For example the display screen may identify other locker banks with available lockers using a locker bank identifier e.g. bank B and or a map of the venue showing the location of the locker banks with available lockers . Optionally the number of lockers available at the other locker banks may also be shown. Audio output transducers allow information such as the number of available lockers or usage instructions to be announced e.g. spoken . Lamps such as light emitting diode LED lamps and similar visual indicators associated with each locker may be lit to signal simple information such as locker status for individual lockers .

Locker status indications include whether the locker is available rented occupied reserved disabled damaged locked or unlocked and whether the allotted rental period has expired or a grace period is active. An example of a grace period is period of extra time allocated for a locker rental beyond the specified rental period communicated to the renter. The availability of a grace period may not be guaranteed and may depend on whether there is immediate need for the locker . A locker is reported as being available if it is not associated with a purchased locker right and is not necessary to fulfill a purchased locker right e.g. is not the only available locker of the type size purchased . A locker is reported as being rented if the locker is associated with a purchased locker right or is necessary to fulfill a purchased locker right. In some implementations the locker is occupied if the locker has been accessed under a purchased locker right. A locker is reported as being occupied if a sensor detects an item stored in the locker . A locker is reported as being disabled if the locker has removed from service e.g. for cleaning or repair . A locker is reported as being damaged if diagnostics indicate a problem with the locker e.g. the door fails to close or the lock fails to lock or unlock . A locker is reported as being reserved if the locker is being held for a specific user set aside for users having a privilege or special needs or needed to fulfill existing rental obligations. A locker is reported as being locked or unlocked based on the state of the lock . Other types of information may be communicated using the output devices .

While an exemplary implementation locker bank with multiple lockers controlled by a single locker terminal is shown other implementations provide a separate locker terminal for each locker . In some instances the locker terminal may be integrated with the lock .

Various implementation of the locker manager memory are configured with a user account memory a locker account memory and a rental plan memory . The user account memory stores a listing of user accounts . As used herein with respect to the locker rental system user accounts are the external ID codes stored or used by the locker manager as opposed to being on an encoded item or stored in the external system . Accordingly the term user account and external ID code may be used interchangeably. Each user account corresponds to an external ID code associated with an encoded item and may store additional information relating to the external ID code such as activation status. In some implementations the full external ID codes are unknown to the locker rental system until the external ID codes have been submitted to the locker manager for activation and user accounts are only generated after the external ID codes are validated e.g. after being submitted by the external access control system a point of sale terminal a locker terminal or a locker rental system kiosk . In such cases the existence of a user account may serve as the indication that the corresponding external ID codes is active. In other implementations the user account memory is pre populated with user accounts for some or all available external ID codes and each user account includes a status that indicates whether the external ID code has been activated and may be used to access a locker . In some implementations the user account memory may also store locker access codes as user accounts to allow locker rentals by users without an external ID code .

The locker account memory stores a listing of locker accounts purchased or otherwise activated by users. For example each individual locker or type of locker being rented may be created as a separate locker account . Each locker account is configured to store information relating to the acquired locker rights such as but not limited to the locker type or rental duration.

As lockers are rented the locker manager associates stored user accounts with locker accounts to define rental plans which are stored in the plan memory . Each rental plan includes at least one locker account . Because a user may rent more than one locker simultaneously multiple locker accounts may be associated with a single rental plan in some implementations. Similarly because multiple users may share a locker multiple user accounts may be associated with a single rental plan . A user account or a locker account may be associated with more than one rental plan . For example a user may have a shared locker with another user under one rental plan and an individual locker under a separate rental plan .

In some implementations the locker manager memory also includes a validation criteria memory . The validation criteria memory is configured to store various validation criteria that may be used by the locker manager to evaluate external ID codes and verify that the external ID code is recognized and valid e.g. has or can be assigned locker rights . The validation criteria memory may store a listing of validation codes rules parameters or other information useable by the locker manager to authenticate or validate external ID codes and determine what rights are or may be associated with an external ID code .

In the illustrated implementation the user account associated with the rental plan stores the external ID code and an optional user account status which indicates whether the external ID code has been activated in the locker rental system . Optionally the user account status may be used to indicate additional information about the external ID code . For example the user account status may indicate that the external ID code is invalid expired reported stolen and the like.

The locker manager may associate multiple external ID codes with the same rental plan . In some implementations each external ID code is associated with a different locker account of the rental plan . For example locker rights may be purchased for a group and each member of the group may receive a separate locker . In other implementations two or more external ID codes may be associated with the same locker account . Members of group e.g. a family may choose to rent one or more lockers that are each accessible by anyone in the group. In still other cases a user may be part of a group and may choose to rent multiple lockers some of which are accessible by selected individuals in the group. In some implementations each external ID code is associated with only one locker account .

For example one rental plan may include a first locker account for a multiple re entry water park locker and a second locker account for a single re entry ride locker . The rental plan may be associated with multiple external ID codes . One of the external ID codes may be associated with only the first locker account thereby enabling the user with the encoded item bearing that external ID code to access the water park locker . Another external ID code may be associated with both the first locker account and the second locker account thereby enabling the user with the encoded item bearing the other external ID code to access both lockers .

The illustrated locker account stores the locker activation status a use indication a locker type a rental duration and a locker identifier . In some implementations the rental plan includes a separate locker account for each locker that is rented by a user. In other instances separate locker accounts are only needed where the rights associated with each locker are different. For example two lockers rented by a single user for a half day with the right to access the locker multiple times may be associated with a single locker account . A second locker account may be added for a third locker rented by the same user for a full day with the right to access the locker multiple times.

The locker activation status indicates whether a user has accessed a locker in accordance with the locker account . The use indication indicates whether the locker is being rented for single re entry or multiple re entry type use.

The rental duration indicates the time period during which the locker may be accessed in accordance with the rental plan . For example in the case of a multiple re entry type locker the rental duration indicates whether the locker is being rented for an hour a day a half day or for some other period of time. In other implementations the rental duration may indicate a maximum number of re entries associated with the rental plan . In certain implementations when the length of time indicated by the rental duration expires the user is charged additional money to re enter the locker . In the case of a single re entry type locker the rental duration may indicate the length of time the user has to access the locker before incurring extra charges. In certain implementations the length of time communicated to the user is less than the actual length of time specified by the rental duration associated with the rental plan . For example the rental plan may include a grace period or mercy time e.g. five minutes ten minutes fifteen minutes etc. that offers a window of time after the stated rental time expires during which the user can remove stored items from the locker without incurring extra charges.

The locker type specifies the types of lockers that may accessed under the rental plan . Rental plans may specify different usage rules and different implementations of the locker rental system may handle rental plans differently. The limitations of one locker account may differ from the limitations of another locker account of the same rental plan . For example in some implementations at least one of the use indication and the rental duration of a first locker account may be different than the corresponding values of second locker account of the same rental plan . In other implementations two locker accounts of the same rental plan may have different locker types .

The locker type or other properties may be used to implement locker rental restrictions or privileges such as type size features or location. In some implementations locker accounts may be associated with privileges. For example some locker accounts e.g. an account for a child may include an indication that the locker account has priority to obtain a locker close to the ground or at a lower level of a bank . Some locker accounts e.g. an account for a VIP or club member may include an indication that the locker account has priority to obtain a priority locker e.g. a large locker or a locker in a desirable location . Other locker accounts may include an indication that the locker account is authorized to obtain a locker that meets American Disability Act ADA specifications. If locker accounts having priority to certain types of lockers have been sold then the locker manager may deny access to one or more of these types of lockers by a non priority account holder even if the locker otherwise meets the limitations of the rental plan .

Each locker account is eventually associated with a locker identifier that identifies a particular locker in the locker rental system . In some instances the locker identifier is associated with the locker account at the time the user requests access to a locker in accordance with existing locker rental right which causes a specific locker to be assigned to the user. For example a user may purchase a right to select any available locker and freely access the locker during the rental period at a point of sale terminal but a particular locker identifier may not be specified at the time the locker right sale transaction occurs. Instead the locker manager associates a specific locker identifier associated with the locker account when the user exercises the right to access a locker . In other instances a specific locker may be assigned and the corresponding locker identifier associated with the locker account by the locker manager at the time of the locker right sale transaction. Accordingly each locker account will have its own unique locker identifier associated therewith.

Rental plans may offer access to a single locker or to multiple lockers . A rental plan may be linked to one or more specific lockers may allow free access to any available locker or may allow free access to lockers based on restrictive criteria such as without limitation locker size type time and location. For example a rental plan may allow a user to simultaneously utilize one large locker and one medium locker or one general locker and one ride locker . In other cases a user may choose to rent a water park locker for the morning and a general park locker for the afternoon. Or a rental plan may allow a user to access any available locker in certain locations but not lockers in other locations.

In some implementations the locker manager may assign lockers to the locker accounts within a rental plan in accordance with a predetermined pattern. For example in some implementations the locker manager may assign the locker accounts within the same rental plan to lockers located in a common area e.g. at the same locker bank . In other implementations the locker manager may assign the locker accounts within the same rental plan to lockers that are geographically spread out e.g. to facilitate access by inhibiting the need to access adjacent lockers simultaneously .

In various implementations the locker accounts may store additional information pertaining to the locker rights and or some information may be omitted when unnecessary or redundant. For example the locker type may be unnecessary when there is no difference between lockers . Or in another example the locker activation status may be omitted as redundant in an implementation that infers whether or not a locker account is active based on the whether or not a locker identifier is specified.

An external ID code generation operation issues the external ID code to a user. In various implementations external ID codes may be provided to users on encoded items such as but not limited to park admission tickets hotel room keys boarding passes vouchers and wristbands.

In an external ID code entry operation the external ID code is supplied to the external system for example via a point of sale terminal . Some instances of the initial external ID code entry operation occur when the user scans the encoded item and a voucher at a locker terminal to claim locker rights purchased online prior to arriving at the venue. Other instances of the initial external ID code entry operation may occur when a user scans the encoded item at a venue operated point of sale system as part of a locker right sale transaction while on site at the venue.

A locker right request determination determines if the external ID code is supplied in conjunction with the creation of locker rights. In other words the point of sale terminal or the external access control system determines whether the external ID code is accompanied by a request to associate locker rights with the external ID code . For example the external access control system may determine that creation or modification of locker rights is being request based on the initiation of a locker right sale transaction at a point of sale terminal .

If creation or modification of new locker rights is requested an activation request operation initiated by the external system sends an activation request to the locker manager that includes the external ID code associated with the locker right sale transaction and optionally pertinent details of the requested locker right e.g. number of lockers types of lockers locker sizes locker locations rental durations etc. including any locker identifiers if specific lockers are identified during the locker right sale transaction. For example the user interface at the point of sale terminal may show locker status information obtained from the locker manager and allow the operator to manually assign lockers .

Upon receiving the activation request an account generation operation is responsible for documenting details of the activation request in the memory of the locker manager . In some implementations if a corresponding user account does not exist the locker manager creates a new user account using the full external ID code supplied in the activation request. Various implementation of the locker manager may also document the locker rights by creating a new locker account based on the information supplied in the activation request.

In a validity determination the locker manager validates the activation request. At a minimum the locker manager determines whether the external ID code is valid i.e. the external ID code is a legitimate code . In some implementations the locker manager compares the relevant portion of each entered external ID code to the validation codes stored as validation criteria to identify whether or not the external ID code is legitimate e.g. a recognized admission ticket barcode and not a UPC code from a soup can . When the external ID codes are smart codes that include some embedded information that differentiates between different authorized external ID codes the validity determination may be more extensive and used to confirm that the requested locker rights are available for that external ID code . In other instances when the external ID codes are dumb codes that are not inherently identifiable or distinguishable e.g. a fixed length barcode employing sequential values the validity determination may simply validate and accept any external ID code from the activation request that meets the validation criteria. For example the validity determination may accept any external ID code from the activation request that is the proper length e.g. eight digits or matches a specified pattern e.g. three letters followed by five numbers .

If the activation request is valid e.g. a match for the external ID code is found an activation operation performed by the locker manager marks the user accounts and or the locker accounts as active in the locker manager memory . In other implementations some or all of the user account and locker account creation functions of the request documentation operation may be deferred until the activation request is determined to be valid. Some implementations may link the external ID codes or user accounts with the locker accounts in a rental plan as part of the activation operation . Thus a rental plan may be created in advance of the external ID code being entered at a locker terminal .

In an activation confirmation operation the locker manager notifies the point of sale terminal that the external ID code has been activated in the locker rental system . Upon receipt of the activation confirmation the point of sale terminal completes the locker right sale transaction if applicable and updates the external access control system with details such as and without limitation the purchase price and other locker right details upon receiving confirmation of activation of the external ID code from the locker manager as part of an external system update operation .

If no match is found during the verification operation i.e. the activation request is not valid the user accounts and or locker accounts may be deactivated deleted or flagged as invalid by an activation denial operation performed by the locker manager . If the user accounts and or locker accounts are already set to inactive no further action is necessary and the activation denial operation completes the activation phase. Optionally the locker manager may send notice of the rejection i.e. non activation to the external access control system as part of the activation denial operation .

When a user seeks access to a locker using the encoded item at the locker rental system the external ID code is supplied to the locker rental system in an external ID code entry operation . In one example the external ID code may be entered when amusement parks guests use admission tickets at a locker terminal to utilize pre purchased locker rights for example locker rights purchased via a point of sale terminal . The external ID code may also be entered in conjunction with the use of a complimentary locker or the contemporaneous purchase of locker rights via the locker terminal or locker rental system kiosk .

In conjunction with entering the external ID code implementations of the locker access method may collect additional information either directly or indirectly from the user. For example if each locker has a separate locker terminal the locker identifier automatically becomes known when the external ID code is entered via the code entry device of the locker terminal corresponding to the selected locker . Similarly the user interface presented by the locker terminal may allow the user to manually select a particular locker to access. In lieu of selecting a particular locker the user interface presented by the locker terminal may allow the user to select the locker type .

Through the user interface the user may indicate whether the locker access transaction is an initial entry into the locker or a subsequent re entry into the locker via the user interface of the locker terminal . Further the user interface may allow a choice of accepting complimentary locker rights or purchasing additional locker rights. Complimentary locker rights e.g. ride locker rights may have a rental duration tied to the estimated wait time for the ride e.g. 15 minutes longer than the estimated wait time and cannot be changed by the user. However the user may select the rental duration when purchasing locker rights rather than accepting complimentary locker rights. The user interface may allow the selection of a PIN that must be entered in addition to the external ID code for added security. In some implementations the PIN may be stored in the user account . In other implementations the PIN may be stored in the locker account allowing the user to select a separate PIN for each locker if desired. Other information pertaining to the rental may be manually entered or automatically inferred.

When the external ID code is entered at the locker terminal the locker rights associated with that external ID code may be in one of several different states. First the external ID code is unknown to the locker rental system . This may occur when the locker rental system does not store all possible external ID codes and only learns the external ID codes actively used to rent lockers . Second no locker rights have been defined. This may occur when no rental plan associated with the external ID code exists. Third defined locker rights may be available but unused. This may occur when no locker identifier is associated with a locker account under a rental plan linked to the external ID code . Fourth defined locker rights may be in use. This may occur when a locker identifier is associated with a locker account under a linked rental plan . Other states e.g. expired locker rights may be exist.

Some states may be known or detectable to the locker terminal . Accordingly an optional activation requested determination to determine whether the locker access transaction includes a request for associate locker rights with the external ID code based on information provided by user may be performed at the locker terminal . For example if the locker terminal determines that a locker access transaction involves the purchase or complimentary acquisition of new or updated locker rights or other situation where locker rights are not defined the access method may branch to an activation operation similar to that described in relation to the activation method . If the locker access transaction involves the re entry into a locker the activation operation may be bypassed. In various implementations some of the additional information may be obtained after the validity of the external ID code has been verified and the external ID code has been activated for use in the locker rental system .

Following the bypass or successful completion of the activation operation the method continues with an access request operation where the locker terminal generates an access request and sends it to the locker manager . The access request includes at least the external ID code and the locker terminal identifier of the locker terminal sending the access request. The locker terminal identifier and or the locker identifier may be used to direct responses back to the originating locker terminal . As previously described a locker may not have been allocated or selected prior to making an initial access request. In some instances the locker identifier may incorporate or be the equivalent of the locker terminal identifier and be used in place of a separate locker terminal identifier.

In some implementations the locker terminal does not determine if activation was requested. Instead upon receipt of the access request the locker manager assumes responsibility for determining whether the external ID code requires activation before access may be granted and performs the activation request determination and if needed the activation operation .

Following the bypass or successful completion of the activation operation a validity determination evaluates the validity of the access request. The locker manager processes the access request to determine if the requested access is in accordance with a rental plan associated with the external ID code . The locker manager retrieves any relevant rental plans by comparing the external ID code in the access request to the external ID codes i.e. user accounts associated with the rentals plans .

After the relevant rental plans are identified the locker manager evaluates the properties of the relevant locker accounts against the information supplied in the access request e.g. the locker identifier to determine if the request is for locker to which the user has rights or obtained generally e.g. the current time to determine if the rental has expired . For example the locker manager determines if the access request is within the rental duration e.g. the time period or permitted number of locker entries . Or for example the locker manager determines if the locker identifier in the access request matches a locker identifier associated with a locker account of a relevant rental plan . If a locker identifier is not specified the locker manager determines if a locker of the appropriate locker type and or in an authorized location is available in the lockers linked to the locker terminal . These examples are not exhaustive and other types and combinations of comparisons may be used to evaluate whether the requested access is in accordance with a relevant rental plan . If the access request satisfies a relevant rental plan the locker manager authorizes access to the locker .

If access is approved and the access request does not include a locker identifier or a substitution for the requested locker is needed a locker assignment operation is performed by some implementations of the locker manager . The locker assignment operation selects a locker satisfying the properties of the locker account and assigns the locker to the user. More specifically the locker manager associates the locker identifier for the selected locker with the locker account .

In an approval notification operation the locker manager sends a response notifying the locker terminal that access is authorized. If the locker manger assigned a locker the response includes the locker identifier to which access is authorized. The response may also include an instruction or command to unlock the specified locker .

If the response received by the locker terminal does not include a locker assignment the locker terminal performs a locker assignment operation as described above. Once the locker is assigned an unlock operation electronically actuates the lock of the assigned locker . In some implementations the locker terminal simply passes an unlock command from the locker manager to the electromechanically actuated lock . In other implementations the locker terminal generates an appropriate signal to unlock the lock . If payment has not been received the locker terminal may collect payment prior to assigning or unlocking the locker .

Once the assigned locker is unlocked the locker access phase of the method concludes with the user gaining access the assigned locker . If the access request determined to be invalid by the verification operation an access denial operation denies access to a locker and optionally sends a message reporting that the access request is invalid to the locker terminal . Following the access denial operation the locker access phase of the method ends.

Upon receiving the activation request an account generation operation is responsible for documenting details of the activation request in the memory of the locker manager . In some implementations if a corresponding user account does not exist the locker manager creates a new user account using the full external ID code supplied in the activation request. Various implementation of the locker manager may also document the locker rights by creating a new locker account based on the information supplied in the activation request.

In a validity determination the locker manager validates the activation request. At a minimum the locker manager determines whether the external ID code is valid i.e. the external ID code is a legitimate code . In some implementations the locker manager compares each entered external ID code or relevant portion thereof to the validation codes stored as validation criteria to identify whether or not the external ID code is legitimate e.g. a recognized admission ticket barcode and not a UPC code from a soup can . When the external ID codes are smart codes that include some embedded information that differentiates between different authorized external ID codes the validity determination may be more extensive and used to confirm that the requested locker rights are available for that external ID code . In other instances when the external ID codes are dumb codes that are not inherently identifiable or distinguishable e.g. a fixed length barcode employing sequential values the validity determination may simply validate and accept any external ID code from the activation request that meets the validation criteria. For example the validity determination may accept any external ID code from the activation request that is the proper length e.g. eight digits or matches a specified pattern e.g. three letters followed by five numbers .

If the activation request is valid e.g. a match for the external ID code is found as part of an activation operation performed by the locker manager marks the user accounts and or the locker accounts as active in the locker manager memory . In other implementations some or all of the user account and locker account creation functions of the account generation operation may be deferred until the activation request is determined to be valid. Some implementations may link the user accounts with the locker accounts in a rental plan as part of the activation operation .

In a status notification operation the locker manager notifies the locker terminal that the external ID code has been activated in the locker rental system .

If the activation request is not valid e.g. the external ID code does not match a validation code or the length is wrong the user accounts and or locker accounts created by the account generation operation may be deactivated deleted or flagged as invalid by an activation denial operation . If the user accounts and or locker accounts are already set to inactive no further action is necessary and the activation denial operation completes the activation phase. Optionally the locker manager may send notice of the rejection i.e. non activation to the locker terminal .

While some actions are described herein as being taken by a certain component it should be appreciated that the action may be performed by other components. For example if the point of sale terminal is implemented as a dumb terminal determinations and other actions may actually be performed by the external access control system . Conversely actions that are described as be performed by the external access control system may be performed by a smart point of sale terminal . Similarly the locker terminal may perform actions that are described as being performed by the locker manager or vice versa. Further actions performed by the locker terminal may also be performed by a locker rental system kiosk . Additionally the locker terminals and locker rental system kiosk may interoperate with the external system .

A hopper also is disposed in the kiosk housing . The hopper is configured to hold multiple encoded items . In some implementations the encoded items in the hopper include locker access codes printed thereon that match locker access codes stored at the locker manager . However the locker access codes printed on the encoded items in the hopper are not yet activated at the locker manager . In other implementations the encoded items in the hopper do not include any locker access code information yet. In still other implementations the encoded items in the hopper may include activated locker access codes printed thereon. The hopper is connected to the dispenser to selectively dispense the encoded items in response to information entered into the input interface . An internal scanner also is disposed in the kiosk housing . In some implementations the internal scanner is disposed at or adjacent the dispenser . In other implementations the internal scanner is disposed adjacent the hopper . In one example implementation the internal scanner is an optical scanner. In another example implementation the internal scanner is a laser scanner.

In some implementations the user purchases locker rights at the kiosk . For example the user may use the input interface to select a number of lockers to be rented the type of each locker to be rented a duration for which the locker will be accessible to the user and the number of people who should have access to each locker. The various options available to the user are presented e.g. visually audibly or haptically using the display interface . In some implementations the kiosk also includes an electronic card reader disposed at the kiosk housing . The card reader is configured to read a value bearing card e.g. a credit card a debit card a gift card a voucher etc. . In other implementations the kiosk is otherwise configured to accept money from a user e.g. a coin slot a dollar reader a check reader etc. .

In other implementations the user redeems a voucher associated with a previously purchased rental plan e.g. by scanning or otherwise entering the locker access code or other indicia from the voucher via the input interface . For example the user may purchase a rental plan online via a park website and redeem the voucher for one or more encoded items at the kiosk . The user also may edit a previously purchased rental plan at the kiosk e.g. to add another locker account to increase the duration for a particular locker account to add a locker access code to the rental plan etc. .

The kiosk also includes a controller e.g. a processor and associated memory or other computing device disposed in the kiosk housing . The controller is configured to receive an order a new order or an existing order via the input interface and to selectively dispense the encoded items via the dispenser in accordance with the order. The controller also is configured to scan a locker access code of each encoded item using the internal scanner as the encoded item is dispensed. The controller communicates with the locker manager to provide the scanned locker access code from the dispensed encoded item to activate the locker access code . Generally scanning a specific external ID code or locker access code at an electronic locker will not unlock a locker door unless that specific external ID code or locker access code has been activated in the locker manager .

In some implementations the encoded item dispensing kiosk also includes an encoder disposed in the kiosk housing . Examples of encoders include but are not limited to printers magnetic strip writers and RFID writers. The encoder prints or otherwise adds the respective locker access code to each encoded item as the encoded item is dispensed from the kiosk housing . In some implementations the encoder adds visual indicia to the encoded item that includes the locker access code. In other implementations the encoder stores the locker access code in an electronic memory included in the encoded item . In some implementations the processor selects a locker access code from a locally stored list of available locker access codes and provides the selected number to the encoder . In other implementations the processor requests an available locker access code from the locker manager and provides the requested locker access code to the encoder .

The dispensing region defines at least one slot through which one or more encoded items e.g. wristbands or card stock tickets are meted out from one or more discharge devices in the interior of the kiosk housing . In the illustrated implementation a guide is positioned to direct the discharged encoded items downwardly. In certain implementations the guide also inhibits unauthorized access to the discharge devices through the slot.

The kiosk housing also has a payment region including one or more payment acceptors. In the example shown the kiosk housing include a bill acceptor and a card acceptor . The bill acceptor is configured to receive paper money. The card acceptor is configured to receive credit cards debit cards gift cards membership cards or other value bearing and or identifying instruments. A coin tray may be provided to allow the kiosk to dispense change. Some types of kiosk housings also include an external scanner e.g. an optical scanner a laser scanner etc. that is configured to read codes e.g. bar codes QR codes alphanumeric codes etc. on coupons receipts purchase slips or other media bearing readable codes.

A receipt dispenser may print out a receipt for the user when the encoded items are dispensed and or when a refund is issued. In certain implementations the receipt dispenser is located near the input output regions . In other implementations the receipt dispenser is located closer to the payment region .

The above specification examples and data provide a complete description of the manufacture and use of the composition of the invention. Since many implementations of the invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention the invention resides in the claims hereinafter appended.
