title: Radio access technology handover optimization in a push-to-talk session
abstract: The disclosure relates to handover optimization in a voice communication session or other real-time multimedia session. For example, a wireless device associated with a parent user may detect a condition triggering a handover during a current voice communication session between the parent user and a target user, wherein the handover has a type associated with a switching delay. The wireless device may maintain statistics relating to an average mutual silence duration after talk spurts from the parent user and the target user based on one or more past voice communication sessions in which at least the parent user participated and trigger the handover when a next talk spurt from either the parent user or the target user ends where the average mutual silence duration exceeds the switching delay associated with the handover type.

The disclosure relates to wireless group communications and in particular to radio access technology RAT handover optimization in a push to talk PTT session.

Wireless communication systems have developed through various generations including a first generation analog wireless phone service 1G a second generation 2G digital wireless phone service including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks and third generation 3G and fourth generation 4G high speed data Internet capable wireless services. There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use including Cellular and Personal Communications Service PCS systems. Exemplary cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System AMPS digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access CDMA Frequency Division Multiple Access FDMA Time Division Multiple Access TDMA the Global System for Mobile access GSM variation of TDMA and newer hybrid digital communication systems using both TDMA and CDMA technologies. More recently Long Term Evolution LTE has been developed as a wireless communications protocol for mobile phones and other terminals to communicate data at high speeds. LTE is based on GSM and includes contributions from various GSM related protocols such as Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution EDGE and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS protocols such as High Speed Packet Access HSPA .

Accordingly communications systems and devices are becoming increasingly diverse with new technological advancements. Communications devices are now able to support various different communications technologies and protocols. For example a wireless telecommunication service generically referred to as Push To Talk PTT capability can provide quick one to one or one to many communications wherein a carrier typically establishes the recipient devices for wireless device communicating in a PTT group. For example a PTT communication connection may typically be initiated in response to a single button push on a wireless device which may activate a half duplex link between the speaker and each member device within the group wherein the device can subsequently receive incoming PTT transmissions once the button is released. In some arrangements the PTT speaker will have the floor whereby no other group member can speak while the speaker holds the floor. Accordingly once the speaker holding the floor releases the PTT button any other individual member within the group can engage a PTT button in order to request and thereby take the floor. Furthermore other wireless communication services may support full duplex Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP sessions where communication may be allowed in both directions such that different parties can communicate simultaneously i.e. parties on different ends can speak and be heard at the same time .

However various conditions may result in a user involved in a half duplex or full duplex voice call needing to trigger a handover from a current base station to a target base station in the same access network or a different access network e.g. user mobility radio conditions cell capacity more favorable conditions in a neighbor cell etc. . In the former case because the current base station and the target base station are in the same access network and therefore implement the same radio access technology RAT the handover may be termed an intra RAT handover. In the latter case the base stations in different access networks may implement different RATs in which case the handover may be termed an inter RAT handover. However in cases where the current and target base stations are in different access networks but implement the same RAT the handover would also be an intra RAT handover. In any case if a wireless device is involved in a half duplex or full duplex voice call and a handover is triggered the voice call may end if the handover delay results in inactivity leading to a dropped call and or perceivable clicks due to packet loss and or delays during the handover may result. Accordingly depending on the target access network handovers that are triggered while a wireless device is involved in a voice call or other real time multimedia session may cause session interruption packet delay packet loss and degraded user experience among other problems.

According to various embodiments illustrates a high level system architecture of a wireless communications system that contains UEs . . . N. The UEs . . . N can include cellular telephones personal digital assistant PDAs pagers a laptop computer a desktop computer and so on. For example in UEs . . . are illustrated as cellular calling phones UEs . . . are illustrated as cellular touchscreen phones or smart phones and UE N is illustrated as a desktop computer or PC.

Referring to UEs . . . N are configured to communicate with an access network e.g. the RAN an access point etc. over a physical communications interface or layer shown in as air interfaces and or a direct wired connection. The air interfaces and can comply with a given cellular communications protocol e.g. CDMA EV DO eHRPD GSM EDGE W CDMA LTE etc. while the air interface can comply with a wireless IP protocol e.g. IEEE 802.11 . The RAN includes a plurality of access points that serve UEs over air interfaces such as the air interfaces and . The access points in the RAN can be referred to as access nodes or ANs access points or APs base stations or BSs Node Bs Evolved Node Bs eNodeBs or eNBs and so on. These access points can be terrestrial access points or ground stations or satellite access points. The RAN is configured to connect to a core network that can perform a variety of functions including bridging circuit switched CS calls between UEs served by the RAN and other UEs served by the RAN or a different RAN altogether and can also mediate an exchange of packet switched PS data with external networks such as Internet . The Internet includes a number of routing agents and processing agents not shown in for the sake of convenience . In UE N is shown as connecting to the Internet directly i.e. separate from the core network such as over an Ethernet connection of Wi Fi or 802.11 based network . The Internet can thereby function to bridge packet switched data communications between UE N and UEs . . . N via the core network . Also shown in is the access point that is separate from the RAN . The access point may be connected to the Internet independent of the core network e.g. via an optical communication system such as FiOS a cable modem etc. . The air interface may serve UE or UE over a local wireless connection such as IEEE 802.11 in an example. UE N is shown as a desktop computer with a wired connection to the Internet such as a direct connection to a modem or router which can correspond to the access point itself in an example e.g. a Wi Fi router with wired and or wireless connectivity may correspond to the access point .

Referring to an application server is shown as connected to the Internet the core network or both. The application server can be implemented as a plurality of structurally separate servers or alternately may correspond to a single server. As will be described below in more detail the application server is configured to support one or more communication services for UEs that can connect to the application server via the core network and or the Internet e.g. Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP sessions Voice over LTE VoLTE sessions Push to Talk PTT sessions group communication sessions sessions that involve Rich Communication Services RCS sessions social networking services etc. .

Examples of protocol specific implementations for the RAN and the core network are provided below with respect to to help explain the wireless communications system in more detail. In particular the components of the RAN and the core network corresponds to components associated with supporting packet switched PS communications whereby legacy circuit switched CS components may also be present in these networks but any legacy CS specific components are not shown explicitly in .

In the core network includes the above noted SGSN B and potentially a number of other SGSNs as well and a GGSN B. Generally GPRS is a protocol used in GSM for routing IP packets. The GPRS core network e.g. the GGSN B and one or more SGSNs B is the centralized part of the GPRS system and also provides support for W CDMA based 3G access networks. The GPRS core network is an integrated part of the GSM core network i.e. the core network that provides mobility management session management and transport for IP packet services in GSM and W CDMA networks.

The GPRS Tunneling Protocol GTP is the defining IP protocol of the GPRS core network. The GTP is the protocol which allows end users e.g. UEs of a GSM or W CDMA network to move from place to place while continuing to connect to the Internet as if from one location at the GGSN B. This is achieved by transferring the respective UE s data from the UE s current SGSN B to the GGSN B which is handling the respective UE s session.

Three forms of GTP are used by the GPRS core network namely i GTP U ii GTP C and iii GTP GTP Prime . GTP U is used for transfer of user data in separated tunnels for each packet data protocol PDP context. GTP C is used for control signaling e.g. setup and deletion of PDP contexts verification of GSN reachability updates or modifications such as when a subscriber moves from one SGSN to another etc. . GTP is used for transfer of charging data from GSNs to a charging function.

Referring to the GGSN B acts as an interface between a GPRS backbone network not shown and the Internet . The GGSN B extracts packet data with associated a packet data protocol PDP format e.g. IP or PPP from GPRS packets coming from the SGSN B and sends the packets out on a corresponding packet data network. In the other direction the incoming data packets are directed by the GGSN connected UE to the SGSN B which manages and controls the Radio Access Bearer RAB of a target UE served by the RAN . Thereby the GGSN B stores the current SGSN address of the target UE and its associated profile in a location register e.g. within a PDP context . The GGSN B is responsible for IP address assignment and is the default router for a connected UE. The GGSN B also performs authentication and charging functions.

The SGSN B is representative of one of many SGSNs within the core network in an example. Each SGSN is responsible for the delivery of data packets from and to the UEs within an associated geographical service area. The tasks of the SGSN B includes packet routing and transfer mobility management e.g. attach detach and location management logical link management and authentication and charging functions. The location register of the SGSN B stores location information e.g. current cell current VLR and user profiles e.g. IMSI PDP address es used in the packet data network of all GPRS users registered with the SGSN B for example within one or more PDP contexts for each user or UE. Thus SGSNs B are responsible for i de tunneling downlink GTP packets from the GGSN B ii uplink tunnel IP packets toward the GGSN B iii carrying out mobility management as UEs move between SGSN service areas and iv billing mobile subscribers. As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art aside from i iv SGSNs configured for GSM EDGE networks have slightly different functionality as compared to SGSNs configured for W CDMA networks.

The RAN e.g. or UTRAN in UMTS system architecture communicates with the SGSN B via a Radio Access Network Application Part RANAP protocol. RANAP operates over an Iu interface Iu ps with a transmission protocol such as Frame Relay or IP. The SGSN B communicates with the GGSN B via a Gn interface which is an IP based interface between SGSN B and other SGSNs not shown and internal GGSNs not shown and uses the GTP protocol defined above e.g. GTP U GTP C GTP etc. . In the embodiment of the Gn between the SGSN B and the GGSN B carries both the GTP C and the GTP U. While not shown in the Gn interface is also used by the Domain Name System DNS . The GGSN B is connected to a Public Data Network PDN not shown and in turn to the Internet via a Gi interface with IP protocols either directly or through a Wireless Application Protocol WAP gateway.

In the core network includes a plurality of Mobility Management Entities MMEs D and D a Home Subscriber Server HSS D a Serving Gateway S GW D a Packet Data Network Gateway P GW D and a Policy and Charging Rules Function PCRF D. Network interfaces between these components the RAN and the Internet are illustrated in and further explained below in Table 1.

A high level description of the components shown in the RAN and core network of will now be described. However these components are each well known in the art from various 3GPP TS standards and the description contained herein is not intended to be an exhaustive description of all functionalities performed by these components.

Referring to the MMEs D and D are configured to manage the control plane signaling for the EPS bearers. MME functions include Non Access Stratum NAS signaling NAS signaling security Mobility management for inter and intra technology handovers P GW and S GW selection and MME selection for handovers with MME change.

Referring to the S GW D is the gateway that terminates the interface toward the RAN . For each UE associated with the core network for an EPS based system at a given point of time there is a single S GW. The functions of the S GW D for both the GTP based and the Proxy Mobile IPv6 PMIP based S5 S8 include Mobility anchor point Packet routing and forwarding and setting the DiffServ Code Point DSCP based on a QoS Class Identifier QCI of the associated EPS bearer.

Referring to the P GW D is the gateway that terminates the SGi interface toward the Packet Data Network PDN e.g. the Internet . If a UE is accessing multiple PDNs there may be more than one P GW for that UE however a mix of S5 S8 connectivity and Gn Gp connectivity is not typically supported for that UE simultaneously. P GW functions include for both the GTP based S5 S8 Packet filtering by deep packet inspection UE IP address allocation setting the DSCP based on the QCI of the associated EPS bearer accounting for inter operator charging uplink UL and downlink DL bearer binding as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 UL bearer binding verification as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203. The P GW D provides PDN connectivity to both GSM EDGE Radio Access Network GERAN UTRAN only UEs and E UTRAN capable UEs using any of E UTRAN GERAN or UTRAN. The P GW D provides PDN connectivity to E UTRAN capable UEs using E UTRAN only over the S5 S8 interface.

Referring to the PCRF D is the policy and charging control element of the EPS based core network . In a non roaming scenario there is a single PCRF in the HPLMN associated with a UE s Internet Protocol Connectivity Access Network IP CAN session. The PCRF terminates the Rx interface and the Gx interface. In a roaming scenario with local breakout of traffic there may be two PCRFs associated with a UE s IP CAN session A Home PCRF H PCRF is a PCRF that resides within a HPLMN and a Visited PCRF V PCRF is a PCRF that resides within a visited VPLMN. PCRF is described in more detail in 3GPP TS 23.203 and as such will not be described further for the sake of brevity. In the application server e.g. which can be referred to as the AF in 3GPP terminology is shown as connected to the core network via the Internet or alternatively to the PCRF D directly via an Rx interface. Generally the application server or AF is an element offering applications that use IP bearer resources with the core network e.g. UMTS PS domain GPRS domain resources LTE PS data services . One example of an application function is the Proxy Call Session Control Function P CSCF of the IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS Core Network subsystem. The AF uses the Rx reference point to provide session information to the PCRF D. Any other application server offering IP data services over cellular network can also be connected to the PCRF D via the Rx reference point.

In the eHRPD RAN includes a plurality of base transceiver stations BTSs E E and E which are connected to an enhanced BSC eBSC and enhanced PCF ePCF E. The eBSC ePCF E can connect to one of the MMEs D or D within the EPS core network A over an S101 interface and to an HRPD serving gateway HSGW E over A10 and or A11 interfaces for interfacing with other entities in the EPS core network A e.g. the S GW D over an S103 interface the P GW D over an S2a interface the PCRF D over a Gxa interface a 3GPP AAA server not shown explicitly in over an STa interface etc. . The HSGW E is defined in 3GPP2 to provide the interworking between HRPD networks and EPS LTE networks. As will be appreciated the eHRPD RAN and the HSGW E are configured with interface functionality to EPC LTE networks that is not available in legacy HRPD networks.

Turning back to the eHRPD RAN in addition to interfacing with the EPS LTE network A the eHRPD RAN can also interface with legacy HRPD networks such as HRPD network B. As will be appreciated the HRPD network B is an example implementation of a legacy HRPD network such as the EV DO network from . For example the eBSC ePCF E can interface with an authentication authorization and accounting AAA server E via an A12 interface or to a PDSN FA E via an A10 or A11 interface. The PDSN FA E in turn connects to HA A through which the Internet can be accessed. In certain interfaces e.g. A13 A16 H1 H2 etc. are not described explicitly but are shown for completeness and would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art familiar with HRPD or eHRPD.

Referring to it will be appreciated that LTE core networks e.g. and HRPD core networks that interface with eHRPD RANs and HSGWs e.g. can support network initiated Quality of Service QoS e.g. by the P GW GGSN SGSN etc. in certain cases.

The group communication server can have an attached or accessible database to store group identification data associated with the wireless telecommunication devices in the PTT communication group . Furthermore in various embodiments a data store shown in as a file management server may be present on the server side LAN . However those skilled in the art will appreciate that the computer components resident on the server side LAN accessible via the wireless network within the PTT communication group or the Internet generally are not limited to the exemplary components shown in .

In various embodiments direct communication e.g. a PTT communication can be established through half duplex channels between one or more communicating wireless telecommunication devices etc. and or one or more additional wireless telecommunication devices in the target set associated therewith. Furthermore the group communication server can attempt to bridge the requested direct communication with the target set if at least one wireless telecommunication device in the target set has informed the group communication server that the at least one wireless telecommunication device is present or otherwise accessible on the wireless network . Alternatively or additionally the group communication server can inform the wireless telecommunication device etc. that a direct communication to the target set could not be bridged if no wireless telecommunication device or at least one wireless telecommunication device in the target set has not indicated presence on the wireless network to the group communication server .

Additionally in various embodiments the system can further include a data store in communication with the group communication server which may be configured to send group directed media to the data store . The data store may thereby receive the group directed media from the wireless telecommunication device e.g. mobile phone and selectively permit members in the PTT communication group to access the group directed media stored therein across the wireless communication network . Furthermore the group directed media can be any suitable media type which may include without limitation graphic media or pictures e.g. in JPEG TIF and other formats audio files e.g. in MP3 MP4 WAV and other formats etc. streaming media e.g. PowerPoint files MOV files and other multimedia application files and other application specific data or custom application data which may either reside at the wireless telecommunication device etc. or in communication therewith.

In general cellular telephones and mobile telecommunication devices e.g. wireless telecommunication devices etc. are being manufactured with increased computing capabilities and are becoming tantamount to personal computers and hand held PDAs. These smart cellular telephones allow software developers to create software applications that can be downloaded and executed on a processor associated with the wireless telecommunication devices etc. e.g. web pages applets MIDlets games data etc. . Furthermore in wireless telecommunication devices that have designated a PTT communication group e.g. PTT communication group as shown in the wireless communication devices can directly connect with other members in the PTT communication group to engage in voice and data communication. However all such direct communications will occur typically through or under the control of the one or more group communication servers . Although all data packets communicated among the wireless telecommunication devices etc. do not necessarily have to travel through the one or more group communication servers the one or more group communication servers may generally provide ultimate control over the communicated data packets because the group communication servers are typically the only components on the server side LAN that may know and or retrieve the identities associated with the members in the PTT communication group or direct the identities associated with the members in the PTT communication group to other computer devices.

Furthermore the transceiver may comprise a transmitter that can transmit a signal using a transmit antenna e.g. the antenna A associated with wireless telecommunication device A one or more external and or integrated antennas associated with wireless telecommunication devices A and or B etc. .

According to various embodiments illustrates an exemplary signaling call flow in which an originating wireless device or originating PTT client may initiate a PTT group communication receive an initial floor grant and subsequently release the floor to allow other PTT group members to take the floor. In particular in response to the originating PTT client requesting a direct PTT call with at least one target wireless device or target PTT client the originating PTT client may transmit a call setup request to a Dispatch Call Handler DCH . For example in various embodiments the call setup request may include an address associated with the target PTT client an application identifier associated with the target PTT client and or other suitable information associated with the target PTT client that may be communicated to the DCH to initiate a PTT group call. The DCH may then perform the PTT call setup functions which may include locating the target PTT client applying any appropriate call restrictions selecting a vocoder and assigning a Media Control Unit MCU resource. In addition the DCH may check capabilities associated with the target PTT client to verify that the target PTT client can support the requested PTT communication. In response to suitably verifying that the target PTT client can support the requested PTT communication the DCH may then send a message announcing the call to the target PTT client which may transmit a message accepting the PTT call to the DCH in response to determining that PTT communications are available on the target PTT client .

In various embodiments in response to receiving the acknowledgement accepting the call from the target PTT client the DCH may transmit a floor grant message to the originating PTT client which may indicate that the PTT call is being established and the originating PTT client can start collecting media e.g. voice data or other appropriate media . As such the originating PTT client may notify the user that the floor was granted and that the user can therefore start to speak wherein the originating PTT client may collect and buffer voice media i.e. the talk spurt collected from the user via the vocoder . In response to the originating PTT client receiving and acknowledging a contact information message from the MCU the buffered voice media or group traffic may be sent to the MCU which may likewise buffer the voice media and forward the group traffic to the target PTT client after receiving an acknowledgement to the contact information message from the target PTT client . At some subsequent point in time the originating PTT client may release the initial floor grant and transmit a PTT release message to the MCU which may then release the floor and send a message acknowledging the floor release to the originating PTT client . Accordingly the originating PTT client the target PTT client and or any other PTT clients that may be participating in the PTT call may then take the floor in a substantially similar manner.

In various embodiments during a PTT call a full duplex call or other real time multimedia session in which a wireless device communicates over a wireless access network certain conditions may trigger a handover to switch the wireless device from a current base station to a target base station and or from a current access network to a different access network. For example user mobility may trigger a handover where the wireless device approaches the edge of the coverage area associated with a current base station or access network radio conditions may trigger a handover where the wireless device receives stronger signals from a neighbor base station or access network than a current base station or access network cell capacity may trigger a handover where a neighbor base station or access network has less loading than the current base station or access network and so on. However depending on the target base station and or the target access network the voice call or other real time multimedia session may end if the handover delay results in inactivity leading to a dropped call perceivable clicks may occur due to packet loss and or delays during the handover whereby handovers that are triggered while a wireless device is involved in a voice call or other real time multimedia session may cause session interruption packet delay packet loss and degraded user experience among other problems.

For example according to various embodiments illustrates an exemplary signaling call flow associated with an intra LTE handover in an LTE network which may generally correspond to a handover where a wireless device or UE detaches from a source eNB and synchronizes to a target eNB using an X2 interface that provides a reference point between the source eNB and the target eNB used for UE handovers. In particular at the UE may transmit a measurement report to the source eNB wherein the measurement report may indicate a strength at which a signal was received from the source eNB a strength at which a signal was received from the target eNB or any other suitable measurement information that the UE may be configured to report to the source eNB . In the illustrated example the source eNB may determine that conditions warrant triggering a handover to the target eNB based on the measurement report received from the UE . As such the UE may receive a Radio Link Control RLC Protocol Data Unit PDU from the source eNB at and the UE may further receive a Radio Resource Control RRC connection reconfiguration message from the source eNB at wherein the RLC PDU received at may represent the last data packet that the UE receives from the source eNB and the RRC connection reconfiguration message includes information associated with the target eNB .

In various embodiments the UE may then detach from the source eNB and perform either a contention free or contention based Random Access Channel RACH procedure to synchronize to the target eNB at . Accordingly after the UE successfully synchronizes to the target eNB at the UE may transmit an RRC connection reconfiguration complete message to the target eNB . In that context a duration between the time when the UE received the RRC connection reconfiguration message from the source eNB to the time when the UE transmitted the RRC connection reconfiguration complete message to the target eNB may represent a total control plane C Plane handover time . In various embodiments after transmitting the RRC connection reconfiguration complete message to the target eNB the UE may then collect system information from the target eNB at and receive a first RLC PDU from the target eNB at wherein the first RLC PDU received at may represent the first data packet that the UE receives from the target eNB . In that context a duration between the time when the UE received the last data packet from the source eNB at to the time when the UE received the first data packet from the target eNB at may represent a total user plane U Plane interruption time . Moreover as shown in the RACH procedure performed between the UE and the target eNB may be contention free or contention based which may impact the total C Plane handover time and consequently impact the total U plane interruption time . For example in a contention free RACH procedure the target eNB generally allocates a Random Access Preamble from a reserved pool such that no collisions will occur. In contrast in a contention based RACH procedure multiple UEs may attempt to connect to the target eNB at the same time such that collisions may occur in the event that multiple UEs transmit the same Preamble identifier. As such in various embodiments whether the RACH procedure performed at is contention free or contention based may impact the total C Plane handover time and the total U Plane interruption time . For example minimum mean and maximum U Plane interruption times that may occur in X2 based intra LTE handovers that use a contention based or a contention free RACH procedure are shown below in Table 2.

Accordingly in the exemplary intra LTE handover shown in the total U Plane interruption time can have a substantial effect on continuity packet delay packet loss user experience and or other aspects associated with a real time session which may further depend on whether a contention based or contention free RACH procedure is used to synchronize the UE to the target eNB . Moreover the total U Plane interruption time typically increases in handovers where the UE switches from a current access network that implements a first radio access technology RAT to a target access network that implements a different RAT i.e. inter RAT handovers and the total U Plane interruption time may also increase in inter system handovers e.g. between 3GPP and non 3GPP accesses . For example various inter RAT handover types and inter system handover types that may cause session interruption packet delay packet loss and otherwise degrade user experience during a VoIP session or other real time multimedia session are defined below in Table 3.

Referring now to an exemplary signaling call flow associated with an E UTRAN to UTRAN intra RAT handover is illustrated to demonstrate how inter RAT and inter system handovers may interfere with VoIP or other real time multimedia sessions. More particularly as shown in an inter RAT handover from a source access network to a target access network may be initiated at i.e. from E UTRAN to UTRAN in the illustrated example at which time uplink and downlink user data may be transmitted via a bearer between the UE and a source eNB and one or more GTP tunnels between the source eNB and one or more core network entities not shown . In various embodiments at the source eNB may then send a handover required message to a source MME to request that the core network establish resources in the target access network . In various embodiments the source MME may then determine that the handover type is an inter RAT handover to UTRAN from information in the handover required message from the source eNB that identifies the target RNC . Accordingly the source MME then initiates a handover resource allocation procedure at which may include sending a relocation request message to the target SGSN .

At the target SGSN then relays the relocation request message to the target RNC to establish the radio network resources e.g. radio access bearers for the UE in the target RNC . For example for each radio access bearer RAB that the target SGSN requests be established the relocation request message sent at may include a RAB identifier one or more RAB parameters a transport layer address e.g. the S GW address for user plane data where a direct tunnel is used or the SGSN address where a direct tunnel is not used and a transport association e.g. an uplink Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Data TEID in the S GW or SGSN . Accordingly at the target RNC allocates the requested resources and returns the applicable parameters to the target SGSN in a relocation request acknowledgement message wherein the target RNC may be prepared to receive downlink GTP PDUs from the S GW or the target SGSN where a direct tunnel is not used for the accepted RABs upon sending the relocation request acknowledgement message to the target SGSN . In various embodiments at the target SGSN may send a relocation response message to the source ME wherein the relocation response message may indicate whether a new S GW has been selected a destination tunnel endpoint for data forwarding in the target RNC one or more data forwarding parameters depending on whether direct or indirect forwarding applies and or other suitable information to assist in relocating the UE to the target RNC .

In various embodiments the signaling that occurs from through generally relates to a preparation phase in the inter RAT handover from E UTRAN to UTRAN. Accordingly uplink and downlink PDUs may continue to be transmitted between the UE and the source eNB until the source MME sends a handover command to the source eNB at to complete the inter RAT handover preparation phase towards the source eNB . Accordingly an uplink and or downlink PDU transmitted at may represent the last data packet that the UE sends to and or receives from the source eNB which initiates data forwarding to the target RNC or alternatively via the S GW not shown as decided by the source MME and or the target SGSN during the handover preparation phase.

Furthermore at the source eNB may send a handover command to the UE to trigger the handover to the target radio access network wherein the handover command sent to the UE may include various parameters that the target RNC established during the preparation phase. In response to receiving the handover command from the source eNB the UE may associate one or more bearer IDs with the respective RABs and suspend transmitting user plane data on an uplink. In various embodiments at the UE moves to the target UTRAN 3G system and executes the inter RAT handover according to the parameters provided in the handover command message received at wherein the inter RAT handover from the source E UTRAN to the target UTRAN may be complete once the UTRAN access procedures are successfully completed at whereby a duration between the time when the UE received the handover command from the source eNB to the time when the UE successfully completed the UTRAN access procedures may represent a total control plane C Plane inter RAT handover time .

At that time the UE may resume transmitting uplink user plane data at on one or more Network Layer Access Point Identifiers NSAPIs having radio resources allocated in the target RNC . However the source eNB may continue to receive downlink user plane PDUs at which the source eNB may relay to either the target RNC where direct forwarding applies or to the source S GW that then further relays the downlink user plane PDUs to the target RNC via a target S GW where indirect forwarding applies. In either case at the target RNC may send a relocation complete message to the target SGSN to indicate that the relocation from the source E UTRAN to the target UTRAN completed at which time the target SGSN may be prepared to receive data from the target RNC and forward each received uplink PDU directly to the S GW. In various embodiments at the target SGSN may inform the source MME that the UE arrived on the target access network through a relocation complete notification and the source MME may further send a message to the target SGSN to acknowledge the information included in the relocation complete notification. Furthermore in various embodiments the source MME may start a timer to supervise when to release resources in the source eNB and the source S GW if the S GW was relocated . For example when the timer expires the source MME generally releases all bearer resources allocated to the UE and further deletes any EPS bearer resources if the S GW was relocated and upon receiving the relocation complete acknowledgement message the target SGSN may start a timer if the target SGSN allocated S GW resources for indirect forwarding.

In various embodiments the target SGSN may then complete the inter RAT handover procedure which may include sending a modify bearer request message to the S GW at in order to inform the S GW that the target SGSN now manages all EPS bearer contexts that the UE has established. The S GW may then communicate with a PDN GW to coordinate modifying the bearers associated with the UE and subsequently transmit a modify bearer response to the target SGSN to acknowledge that the user plane switch successfully completed and that the user plane path has been established for all EPS bearer contexts between the UE the target RNC the target SGSN where a direct tunnel is not used the S GW and the PDN GW. Accordingly the UE may receive a first downlink PDU from the target RNC at whereby a duration between the time when the UE received the last PDU from the source eNB at to the time when the UE received the first PDU from the target RNC at may represent a total user plane U Plane interruption time . Accordingly due at least in part to the substantial signaling between the source access network and the target access network required to complete the inter RAT handover substantial U Plane interruption time may occur in inter RAT and inter system handovers. Additional detail relating to the inter RAT handover procedure shown in can be found in 3GPP Technical Specification 23.401.

Accordingly to reduce the potential negative effects and the interruption packet delay packet loss and degraded user experience that handovers can cause during VoIP sessions or other real time multimedia sessions the various embodiments described in further detail herein may utilize characteristics associated with PTT sessions and or full duplex VoIP sessions to obtain user behavior statistics that can be used to determine whether and or when to trigger a handover. For example according to various embodiments illustrates an exemplary group communication platform that can be used to control handovers during a PTT and or full duplex VoIP session.

More particularly according to various embodiments the group communication platform shown in includes a Mobile Station Modem MSM and various software layers that are generally layered above the MSM . For example as shown in the various software layers in the group communication platform may include Advanced Mobile Subscriber Software AMSS layered above the MSM a mobile operating system layer e.g. implementing the BREW software platform mentioned above layered above the AMSS and an application layer above the mobile operating system layer wherein the application layer may generally include a handover control module a PTT client a group media client and other PTT aware applications . Accordingly the various software layers in the group communication platform may drive an underlying chipset associated with the MSM and implement a CDMA communication technologies suite that includes CDMA2000 1 and CDMA2000 1xEV DO according to a software protocol stack. For example in one embodiment the mobile operating system layer may provide one or more application programming interfaces APIs for chip specific and or device specific operations and further provide an isolation layer that eliminates direct contact with the AMSS and any OEM software on the group communication platform . Furthermore the mobile operating system layer enables application development that uses mobile device features without having to rewrite the application each time a new release of the device specific software is released. However those skilled in the art will appreciate that the group communication platform can alternatively implement the various embodiments disclosed herein using other software configurations e.g. Linux Windows or other operating systems or architectures .

According to various embodiments the PTT client may generally comprise an application that may offer access to PTT services through an external and or internal interface e.g. a PTT aware user interface . In general the PTT client may include all the functionality that applications may require to run on the mobile operating system such as the handover control module and the group media client . In addition to providing access to PTT services the PTT client may provide a layer to isolate all PTT aware applications and interfaces to a group communication server or other network side components. As such in one embodiment the PTT client may maintain access to PTT services respond to group communication requests process all requests that relate to PTT services from the PTT aware applications process all outgoing PTT requests collect and package vocoder data packets associated with originated PTT talk spurts parse vocoder data packets associated with terminated PTT talk spurts and detect mutual silence that occurs between the time when a PTT talk spurt ends and a new PTT talk spurt begins.

According to various embodiments the group media client may comprise a mobile operating system based application that extends PTT services to media types other than traditional half duplex voice communications e.g. full duplex VoIP sessions . As such the group media client may provide access to group media services through the external and or internal PTT aware user interface. For example in various embodiments the PTT aware user interface may comprise a mobile operating system based application or an application used in combination with an interface to the AMSS . In general the PTT aware user interface may invoke the appropriate APIs e.g. APIs associated with other resident PTT aware applications in response to user requests that may relate to group directed media services. The group media client may thereby service the user requests and inform the user about the result associated with any group directed media requests.

According to various embodiments as noted above the software layers included in the group communication platform shown in may further include a handover control module that can be used to determine whether and or when to trigger a handover during a PTT or full duplex voice communication session wherein the handover control module may communicate with the PTT client the group media client and the other PTT aware applications to support services that relate to handovers during PTT and or full duplex voice communication sessions. More particularly in various embodiments the handover control module that may collect and store statistics that can be consulted to control whether and or when to trigger a handover during a PTT and or full duplex VoIP session according to user behavior during past half duplex e.g. PTT and or full duplex VoIP sessions between a parent user i.e. the user who owns or is otherwise associated with a device implementing the group communication platform and various target users. Furthermore the handover control module may collect and store statistics that relate to average switching delays that occurred during different handover types at different locations which the handover control module may compare against the user behavior statistics to determine whether and or when to trigger a handover if necessary .

For example according to various embodiments illustrates an exemplary timing diagram corresponding to a PTT and or full duplex voice communication session between a parent user and a target user wherein the handover control module may monitor mutual silence and or talk bursts between the parent user and the target user to collect statistics that can be used to control handover during the voice communication session and or subsequent voice communication sessions between the parent user and the target user. More particularly referring to the timing diagram shown in the handover control module may determine when one or more talk spurts from the parent user and determine when one or more talk spurts from the target user end which may further indicate times when mutual silence periods start and trigger points to initiate a handover if needed . For example in various embodiments the handover control module may determine when the parent user talk spurts and the target user talk spurts end according to an explicit signaling message e.g. a Media Burst Control Protocol MBCP message as utilized in the Open Mobile Alliance Push to talk over Cellular OMA POC architecture . In another example the handover control module may determine when the parent user talk spurts and the target user talk spurts end according to marker bits that can be set in Real Time Transport Protocol RTP packets to indicate when the parent user talk spurts and or the target user talk spurts end. In any case the handover control module may determine an average duration associated with the parent user talk spurts an average duration associated with the target user talk spurts and an average duration associated with the mutual silence periods . Furthermore the handover control module may determine how many times the parent user and the target user took the floor during the voice communication session four times and three times respectively in the example shown in . Accordingly the handover control module may then update statistics in a user behavior table to track characteristics associated with voice communication sessions between the parent user and the target user. For example as shown in Table 4 the user behavior table may store statistics based on past PTT and or full duplex voice communication sessions between the parent user and each target user in a contact list associated with the parent user that has participated in one or more past voice communication sessions with the parent user and the average statistics across existing target users may be calculated and used with respect to new target users that have not participated in a past voice communication session with the parent user.

Accordingly in various embodiments the handover control module may track and store statistics that relate to how often the parent user i.e. the user who owns the device that may potentially be subject to a handover took the floor in PTT sessions with each individual target user and how often the parent user spoke in full duplex sessions with each individual target user and may likewise track and store statistics that relate to how often each individual target user took the floor in the PTT sessions with the parent user and how often each individual user spoke in the full duplex sessions with the parent user. Furthermore the handover control module may track and store statistics that relate to average durations associated with talk spurts from the parent user talk spurts from each individual target user and mutual silence periods during the PTT and full duplex sessions between the parent user and each individual target user. Accordingly after each PTT and or full duplex session between the parent user and one or more target users ends the statistics stored in the user behavior table may be updated according to the characteristics associated with that session e.g. how many times the parent user and the target user took the floor or spoke during the session average mutual silence durations in between turns speaking etc. . Furthermore as noted above the average statistics across all existing target users may be calculated and used with respect to any new target users that have not previously participated in a PTT and or full duplex session with the parent user during the first PTT and or full duplex session with the new target users whereby after the first PTT and or full duplex session with the new target users end new entries may be added to the user behavior table to store statistics relating to the new target users based on behavior during the first session.

Furthermore in various embodiments the handover control module may collect and store statistics that relate to average switching delays during different handover types at different locations which may be compared against the user behavior statistics to determine whether and or when to trigger a handover if needed. For example as shown in Table 5 below the handover control module may maintain statistics that relate to the average delay that occurred when switching from a current radio access technology RAT to a target RAT during inter RAT handovers at particular locations and when switching from a source eNB to a target eNB during intra RAT handovers wherein depending on any optimizations that radio access network RAN operators may offer the average switching delays shown in Table 5 may follow a pattern where D

Accordingly to determine whether and or when to trigger a handover the handover control module may generally consult the statistics in the user behavior table and the handover table to determine a handover trigger point if needed. For example according to various embodiments illustrates an exemplary method in which mutual silence and or talk burst statistics may be utilized to determine a handover trigger point during a PTT session wherein the method shown in may generally be performed using the statistics in the user behavior table and the statistics in the handover table.

In particular the parent user may be engaged in a PTT and or full duplex voice communication session with one or more target users at block and a handover process may be started at block due to mobility conditions radio conditions cell capacity more favorable conditions in a neighbor cell or other suitable conditions. In various embodiments at block the statistics in the user behavior table stored on the device associated with the parent user may be consulted at block to identify a more frequent talker among the parent user and the target users. For example referring to the example statistics provided above in Table 4 Alice historically takes the floor more often than the parent user Jane does not take the floor that often compared to the parent user and Jill takes the floor at approximately the same frequency as the parent user. As such in a voice communication session with Alice block may identify Alice as the more frequent talker whereby the handover may be triggered after the next talk spurt from Alice finishes. On the other hand in a voice communication session with Jane block may identify the parent user as the more frequent talker whereby the handover may be triggered after the next talk spurt from the parent user finishes. However in a voice communication session with Jill neither the parent user nor Jill may be identified at block because both users take the floor at approximately the same frequency whereby the handover may be triggered after the next talk spurt from either the parent user or Jill.

Accordingly in response to having appropriately identified the more frequent talker among the parent user and the target users involved in the voice communication session whether the talk spurt from the identified user has finished may be determined at block . After the talk spurt from the identified user finishes a determination may be made as to whether the average mutual silence between the parent user and the target users can be deemed adequate to support the current handover type. For example at block the handover statistics table may be consulted to determine the average switching delay associated with the current handover type based on the current location associated with the device subject to the handover wherein the average switching delay associated with the current handover type may be compared against the average mutual silence period between the parent user and the target user. For example referring again to the example statistics provided above in Table 4 the average mutual silence between Alice and the parent user historically lasts about five seconds which may be adequate to proceed with any handover type the average mutual silence between Jane and the parent user historically lasts about three seconds which may be adequate to proceed with intra RAT handovers and the average mutual silence between Jill and the parent user historically lasts about four seconds which may be adequate to proceed with most handover types. As such in response to determining at block that the average mutual silence between the parent user and the target user exceeds the average switching delay associated with the current handover type the average mutual silence may be deemed adequate and the current handover can proceed accordingly at block after the triggering talk spurt has finished. Otherwise in the event that the average mutual silence between the parent user and the target user does not exceed the average switching delay associated with the current handover type the average mutual silence may be inadequate to proceed with the current handover type e.g. where the current handover is an inter RAT handover and the target user is Jane . In that case the device subject to the handover may allow the modem make the handover decision at block e.g. based on the conditions that triggered the handover at block .

According to various embodiments illustrates an exemplary signaling call flow in which a handover during a PTT session may be triggered or delayed based on a talk burst queue position status which may occur in combination with and or in an alternative to the handover control techniques described above based on the statistics that relate to user behavior and the statistics that relate to handover switching delays. In particular the signaling flow shown in may generally support queuing talk burst requests received from participants during a PTT session e.g. according to the OMA PoC architecture wherein talk burst requests that are received from one or more PTT clients while another PTT client has permission to send a talk burst may be queued. In that context the signaling flow shown in may allow a PTT client to request a queue position or other status associated with queued talk burst requests from the PTT client and or other PTT clients not shown from a participating PTT server and or a controlling PTT server which may be configured to mediate the PTT session between the PTT client and the other PTT clients.

For example in the signaling call flow shown in the controlling PTT server may have granted Alice permission to send a talk burst at wherein the controlling PTT server may receive media corresponding to the talk burst from Alice at and forward the received media to the participating PTT server at . The participating PTT server may then relay the media to the PTT client associated with Bob at . In various embodiments Bob may press a PTT button or otherwise request permission to send a talk burst at in response to which the PTT client associated with Bob may send a talk burst request to the participating PTT server at which may relay the talk burst request to the controlling PTT server at . Furthermore if Bob has permission to request priority levels other than normal priority the talk burst request sent at and can include a priority level at which Bob has permission to access.

In various embodiments the controlling PTT server may determine that Alice has permission to send a talk burst at the time that the talk burst request is received from the PTT client associated with Bob. Accordingly assuming that Bob does not currently have a talk burst request in the queue and has not requested to preempt the talk burst from Alice or alternatively that Alice has preemptive priority over Bob in the event that the talk burst request sent at and includes a priority level at which Bob has permission to access the controlling PTT server may queue the talk burst request from Bob and send a talk burst queue position status message to the PTT client associated with Bob through the participating PTT server at . For example in various embodiments the talk burst queue position status message may indicate the current position that the PTT client holds in the talk burst request queue and may optionally further indicate the priority level if any granted to the talk burst request from the PTT client .

Accordingly Bob may see the current position that the PTT client holds in the talk burst request queue at and determine whether to trigger a handover or delay the handover based thereon. For example if the talk burst queue position status indicates that Bob s turn to talk will occur soon Bob may command the PTT client to delay the handover at . Alternatively if the talk burst queue position status indicates that Bob has a low position in the queue and will not have a turn to talk for a while Bob may command the PTT client to trigger the handover immediately at . In a further example because Bob can request the position that other participants hold in the talk burst queue the decision about whether to trigger or delay the handover at may depend on the position that the other participants hold in the talk burst queue. For example if an important participant will be talking next or talking soon e.g. a boss co worker etc. the command at may delay the handover whereas if the next few participants that will be talking are less important the command sent at may immediately trigger or otherwise advance the handover.

According to various embodiments illustrates an exemplary method in which a handover during a PTT session may be triggered or delayed based on a talk burst queue position status e.g. according to the signaling call flow shown in . More particularly the method may generally be carried out on a wireless device that can operate in an architecture e.g. OMA PoC that supports queuing talk burst requests received from participants in a PTT session when another participant in the PTT session has already been granted the floor and or permission to send a current talk burst.

For example in various embodiments a PTT server may grant permission to send a current talk burst to a participant in a PTT session at some point in time prior to a parent participant in the PTT session e.g. a user associated with the wireless device carrying out the method requesting permission to send a talk burst at block . Furthermore in use cases where the parent participant has permission to request a priority level other than normal the talk burst requested at block may further include a priority level at which the parent participant has permission to access. In various embodiments because the PTT server already granted permission to send a current talk burst to the other participant in the PTT session the PTT server may queue the talk burst requested at block . In a similar respect in the event that the talk burst requested at block specified a priority level at which the parent participant has permission to access the PTT server may queue the requested talk burst if the parent participant did not request to preempt the talk burst from the other participant or alternatively if the other participant has preemptive priority over the parent participant. In any case in scenarios where the PTT server queues the requested talk burst a talk burst queue position status message may be received from the PTT server at block wherein the talk burst queue position status message may indicate the current position that the parent participant holds in the talk burst request queue and may optionally further indicate the priority level if any granted to the talk burst request from the parent participant.

Accordingly in various embodiments the parent participant may learn the current position that the requested talk burst holds in the queue and determine whether to trigger and or delay a handover based thereon. For example in response to determining at block that the talk burst queue position status indicates that the parent participant has an approaching turn to talk the parent participant may input a command to delay the handover at block . Alternatively in response to determining at block that the parent participant has a low position in the queue or otherwise does not have an approaching turn to talk the parent participant may further determine at block whether the talk burst queue position status message indicates that an important participant or other participant of interest will be talking next or talking soon e.g. a boss co worker etc. . Accordingly if an important participant or other participant of interest will be talking next or talking soon the parent participant may similarly input a command to delay the handover at block . Otherwise where the parent participant does not have an approaching turn to talk and the next one or more participants in the queue are not deemed sufficiently important to delay the handover the parent participant may input a command to immediately trigger or otherwise advance the handover at block .

According to various embodiments illustrates an exemplary signaling call flow that may occur in a PTT session prior to during and after a handover. More particularly at and a parent PTT client and a target PTT client may each transmit a respective Session Initiation Protocol SIP REGISTER message to an application server wherein the SIP REGISTER messages may include a current IP address associated with the parent PTT client and the target PTT client and a Uniform Resource Identifier URI at which the parent PTT client and the target PTT client wish to receive calls. At and the application server may transmit a SIP 200 OK message to the parent PTT client and the target PTT client to indicate that the requests sent at and succeeded. In various embodiments at the parent PTT client may then send a SIP INVITE message to the application server to invite the target PTT client to participate in a PTT call session wherein the SIP INVITE message may include a Session Description Protocol SDP user name associated with the parent PTT client e.g. Bob in addition to a port number and Internet Protocol IP address associated with the parent PTT client . At the application server may then relay the SIP INVITE message to the target PTT client which may return a SIP 200 OK message to the application server to indicate that the invitation to participate in the PTT call session was accepted at . Accordingly the SIP 200 OK message sent to the application server may include an SDP user name e.g. Alice port number and IP address associated with the target PTT client . At the application server may then relay the SIP 200 OK message to the parent PTT client whereby the parent PTT client and the target PTT client may have sufficient information about one another to establish the PTT call session at .

In various embodiments at some subsequent point in time the parent PTT client may initiate a handover according to the techniques described in further detail above e.g. statistics that relate to whether Bob or Alice historically take the floor more often during PTT and or full duplex voice sessions with one another an average mutual silence duration following talk spurts during voice sessions between Bob and Alice an average switching delay associated with the handover to be initiated at etc. . In various embodiments after performing a successful handover to a target radio access technology RAT or target eNB the existing session parameters that were used to establish the session at need to be updated. Accordingly at the parent PTT client may send a SIP re INVITE message to the application server to update the prior contact information associated with the media stream e.g. a new port and new IP address on the target RAT or target eNB . At the application server may relay the SIP re INVITE message to the target PTT client which may return a SIP 200 OK message to the application server at to indicate that the contact information was successfully updated and to restate the SDP user name port number and IP address associated with the target PTT client . At the application server may relay the SIP 200 OK message to the parent PTT client at which time the parent PTT client and the target PTT client may have sufficient information to resume the media stream.

A receive processor may process the detected symbols provide decoded data for wireless communication device and or desired services to a data sink and provide decoded overhead information to a controller processor . In general the processing by MIMO detector and receive processor is complementary to the processing by TX MIMO processor and transmit processor at base station .

On the uplink at wireless communication device data from a data source and overhead information from a controller processor may be processed by a transmit processor further processed by a TX MIMO processor if applicable conditioned by modulators through and transmitted via antennas through . At base station the uplink signals from wireless communication device may be received by antennas conditioned by demodulators detected by a MIMO detector and processed by a receive processor to obtain the data and overhead information transmitted by wireless communication device .
