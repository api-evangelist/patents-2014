title: Web-based security authentication
abstract: A method and system for performing a security authentication. A name of a user, N sequences of digits, and encrypted values respectively corresponding to the digits in the N sequences are transmitted to a destination device. Each sequence includes a same M unique digits and begins with a different digit, wherein N≧2 and M≧3. N encrypted values of the transmitted encrypted values are received, wherein an Ireceived encrypted value of the N received encrypted values corresponds to one of the digits selected by the user, at an electronic device, from a respective Isequence of the N sequences (I=1, 2, . . . , N). N digits respectively corresponding to the received N encrypted values are determined. The determined N digits form a number matching a PIN associated with the name of the user, which authenticates the user to access a resource.

This application is a continuation application claiming priority to Ser. No. 13 104 535 filed May 10 2011.

Security data such as usernames passwords and PINs are commonly required for a user to access a number of computing resources including websites financial accounts shopping accounts and other protected data. A user may access the protected resource or data using a smartphone a personal digital assistant a tablet computer a laptop a desktop computer a kiosk an ATM terminal a point of sale terminal or other electronic devices.

The entry of login credentials such as username password and PIN data are vulnerable to at least three types of known attack techniques. A covert key logging software residing in the computing device is capable of capturing recording and reporting keystrokes entered by the user. In scenarios where the user uses a web browser to access a web resource or for authentication the data communicated between the user device and the web server is also vulnerable to man in the middle attacks. Another form of attach commonly called cross site request forgery can exploit a user s authenticated identity at a website and cause an unauthorized action. These and other security risks may expose the user s protected resources and data to unauthorized access. Accordingly a need arises for a solution to greatly minimize or eliminate such unauthorized access to confidential and protected data and resources.

A security authentication method comprises establishing a user account associated with a login credential generating an encryption salt generating graphical key images of a plurality of sequences of values each beginning at a random point generating encrypted key values by encrypting each value in the plurality of sequences using the generated encryption salt incorporating the graphical key images and encrypted key values into a displayable input form receiving user input including a plurality of encrypted key values generating decrypted key values by decrypting the encrypted key values of the user input using the encryption salt and verifying that the decrypted key values match the login credential.

A security authentication method comprises establishing a user account associated with a login credential generating an encryption salt generating graphical key images of a plurality of sequences of values each beginning at a random point generating encrypted key values by encrypting each value in the plurality of sequences using the generated encryption salt incorporating the graphical key images and encrypted key values into a displayable input form receiving user input from a user including a plurality of encrypted key values generating decrypted key values by decrypting the encrypted key values of the user input using the encryption salt and giving the user access to data associated with the user account in response to the decrypted key values matching the login credential.

A security authentication system comprises a security authentication server operable to establish a user account associated with a login credential generate an encryption salt generate graphical key images of a plurality of sequences of values each beginning at a random point and generate encrypted key values by encrypting each value in the plurality of sequences using the generated encryption salt. The system further comprises a server operable to receive the graphical key images and encrypted key values from the security authentication server and incorporate the graphical key images and encrypted key values into a displayable input form. The system further comprises an electronic device operable to display the input form receive user input from a user including a plurality of encrypted key values. The security authentication server further operable to receive the user input from the server generate decrypted key values by decrypting the encrypted key values of the user input using the encryption salt verifying the decrypted key values with the login credential and notifying the server of successful authentication.

A security authentication system comprises means for establishing a user account associated with a login credential means for generating an encryption salt means for generating graphical key images of a plurality of sequences of values each beginning at a random point means for generating encrypted key values by encrypting each value in the plurality of sequences using the generated encryption salt means for incorporating the graphical key images and encrypted key values into a displayable input form means for receiving user input including a plurality of encrypted key values means for generating decrypted key values by decrypting the encrypted key values of the user input using the encryption salt and means for verifying that the decrypted key values match the login credential.

A security authentication method comprises transmitting a request for login into a user account to a web server receiving an input form from the web server having graphical key images of a plurality of sequences of values and encrypted key values displaying the input form in a rotary dial format receiving user input entered using the input form and transmitting encrypted key values representing the user input to the web server for authentication.

The electronic device may require a security code such as a password or PIN to operate and or access information accounts or other protected resources. For example a smartphone personal digital assistant or laptop computer may require a password to unlock the device to enable use. As another example the user must enter the correct login credential to access an online financial account an online email account a shopping website a social media website and a variety of other protected resources and data. In the system and method described below the user s login credentials are verified by a remote security authentication server service that avoids certain security risks such as key logging man in the middle and cross site request forgery attacks.

A security authentication server also connected to the Internet and World Wide Web is capable of authenticating the login credentials entered by the user at the electronic devices without exposing them to security risks such as key logging man in the middle and cross site request forgery attacks. The authentication server may be one or more computing devices virtual machines or other computing entities including necessary operating systems network drivers and configurations and other software. Although not shown explicitly the electronic devices may connect to the Internet and World Wide Web through other intermediate wired and wireless computer and telecommunications networks. In one embodiment the desktop computer laptop computer web server and authentication server may each be configured in accordance with the electronic device of described supra.

In response the security authentication server generates an encryption salt which is a string of random bits of a predetermined length and key images as shown in step . The key images for a three digit numerical PIN code example would be three independent series of numerals in sequence each starting at a random point. For example as shown in the key images of the first series begins at 4 and ends at 3 the second series begins at 7 and ends at 6 and the third series begins at 9 and ends at 8. The security authentication server further generates the corresponding encrypted value for each numeral in the key images using the generated encryption salt. For example numeral 0 may correspond to rTcee3rd numeral 1 may correspond to grru6erd numeral 2 may correspond to ur8etree etc. In step the username and the randomized security data that include the key images and encrypted values are transmitted to the web server . Preferably only a location reference where the key images are stored and accessible is transmitted such as a URL Uniform Resource Locator .

In response the web server generates an input form using the key image URL and encrypted values as shown in step . The input form may be in HTML Hypertext Markup Language and incorporates the key images. As described above each of the numerals in the key images are encoded with a value that is generated with the encryption salt by the security authentication server . Therefore clicking on any numeral by the user generates the corresponding encrypted value. For example clicking on an image of 2 may generate the encrypted value ur8etree and clicking on an image of 3 may generate the encrypted value rEr8rr3d. Accordingly for a numerical PIN each numeral has a corresponding encrypted value. The input form is then transmitted to the user s electronic device in step .

In step the electronic device renders the input form on the display screen that includes the key images where the numerals are each associated with an encrypted value. An example is shown in in which the key images may be displayed in the form of scrollable wheels or dials where the user may scroll up and down along the sequences of numerals using the up and down arrows or mouse scroll wheel for example. The user may enter the security code or PIN by clicking on the appropriate numeral key images in the input form. Once a digit of the PIN is selected the numerals in that sequence are obfuscated so that the selected numeral is not displayed. Scrolling would cause the obfuscated numerals to again be displayed. Once the user selects all three digits of the PIN code the user may submit the input form. This causes the user s encrypted PIN input to be transmitted to the web server as shown in step .

The web server in turn transmits the encrypted user input along with the username to the security authentication server as shown in step . The security authentication server determines whether the corresponding values of the encrypted user input are the correct PIN values for that particular user and authenticates the login credentials as shown in step . If the received encrypted values do not correctly correspond to the user s security code or PIN stored at the security authentication server then authentication fails and the user s access is denied. The security authentication server further deletes or otherwise renders unusable the key images and encryption salt used in this session. The authentication approval or denial is then conveyed to the web server in step . If the user s credentials are approved the user may proceed in the login process as shown in step . The approval or denial is in turn conveyed to the user s electronic device in step . If approval the user gains access to the website or other protected resources and data as shown in steps and . However if access is denied the user is barred from obtaining the protected data and accessing the resources.

The user may have a predetermined number of tries to enter the correct login credentials. Each time the user requests access to protected resources or data new key images the encryption salt and encrypted values are generated and used for that session.

An API application program interface executing on the security authentication server may be used to perform the functions of communicating with the web server receiving requests for key images transmitting the requested key images to the web server and validating the encrypted login credentials. An API conforming to the REST Representational State Transfer constraints RESTful or another suitable architecture may be used. The key images transmitted from the API to the web server may be in the JSON JavaScript Object Notation format or another suitable format. An HTML widget executing on the user s electronic device may be used to add the security code input form to the HTML web page that is displayed to request entry of the login credential.

Although the method and data flow described above provide that certain functions or steps are carried out at a particular situs or in a particular manner the system and method are not so limited. For example the security authentication server may additionally generate the input form and provide a location reference thereto to the electronic device. The widget in the electronic device is then operable to display the input form with the graphical key images by referencing the location reference. Further the web server and the security authentication server may be separate servers as shown in or may be an integrated server if desired.

The features of the present invention which are believed to be novel are set forth below with particularity in the appended claims. However modifications variations and changes to the exemplary embodiments described above will be apparent to those skilled in the art and the system and method described herein thus encompass such modifications variations and changes and are not limited to the specific embodiments described herein.
