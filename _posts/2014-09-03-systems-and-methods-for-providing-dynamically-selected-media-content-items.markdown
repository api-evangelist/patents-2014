The present technology relates to the field of providing content. More particularly the present technology relates to techniques for providing dynamically selected media content items.

Today people often utilize computing devices or systems for a wide variety of purposes. Users can use their computing devices to for example interact with one another access content share content and create content. In some cases a user of a social networking system or service can utilize his or her computing device to create and post media content items such as images videos audio and text. Under conventional approaches access to the media content items can be provided via a profile page of the user. For example image content items can be presented in a particular section of the profile page of the user. The user s connections or friends within the social networking system can access view or interact with the user s posted image content items or other media content items as long as the user s privacy settings allow so.

Under conventional approaches media content items associated with the user are generally provided in an uninteresting or inefficient manner. For example conventional approaches generally present and organize image content items posted by or tagged with the user in a predictable or static manner. As such conventional approaches can create challenges for or reduce the overall user experience associated with using the social networking system.

Various embodiments of the present disclosure can include systems methods and non transitory computer readable media configured to identify a set of media content items associated with a first user of a social networking system. It can be determined that a second user of the social networking system is attempting to access at least a portion of the set of media content items associated with the first user. A first subset of media content items can be dynamically selected out of the set of media content items. In some cases each media content item in the first subset can satisfy specified selection criteria. The second user can be provided with access to a representation of the first subset of media content items. In some instances the representation of the first subset can be provided in a media access interface associated with the first user.

In an embodiment it can be determined that at least a second subset of media content items out of the set of media content items fails to satisfy the specified selection criteria. It can be determined that the at least the second subset is accessible to the second user based on one or more privacy settings of the first user. The second user can be provided with access to a representation of the second subset of media content items. In some cases the representation of the first subset can be provided at a first position in the media access interface associated with the first user. The representation of the second subset can be provided at a second position in the media access interface. The second position can be lower in positional priority than the first position.

In an embodiment it can be determined that at least a third subset of media content items out of the set of media content items fails to satisfy the specified selection criteria. It can be determined that the at least the third subset is accessible to the second user based on the one or more privacy settings of the first user. The second user can be provided with access to a representation of the third subset of media content items. In some cases the representation of the third subset can be provided at a third position in the media access interface. The third position can be lower in positional priority than the second position.

In an embodiment each of the second subset and the third subset can be associated with to at least one of a story a post an event or an album.

In an embodiment the first position can be vertically higher than the second position the second position can be vertically higher than the third position and the second subset can be associated with a more recent time frame than the third subset.

In an embodiment a vertical scroll element can be provided for navigating among at least the representation of the first subset the representation of the second subset and the representation of the third subset. In some instances a first scroll element position in the vertical scroll element can correspond to the first position in the media access interface a second scroll element position in the vertical scroll element can correspond to the second position in the media access interface and a third scroll element position in the vertical scroll element can correspond to the third position in the media access interface. A first title can be provided for the first subset at the first scroll element position. A second title can be provided for the second subset at the second scroll element position. A third title can be provided for the third subset at the third scroll element position.

In an embodiment information about at least one of the first user the second user or the set of media content items can be acquired. The information can include at least one of an image classification applied to at least a portion of the first subset or social graph data associated with the at least one of the first user the second user or the set of media content items. In some cases the selection criteria can be based on the information.

In an embodiment an interaction initiated by the second user with respect to the representation of the first subset can be received. It can be determined that an entirety of the first subset is accessible to the second user based on one or more privacy settings of the first user. The second user can be provided with access to the entirety of the first subset subsequent to the receiving of the interaction. Information about the first subset can be provided. In some instances the information can include at least one of a set of time frames associated with the first subset a set of users associated with the first subset or a set of locations associated with the first subset.

In an embodiment a map can be provided in the media access interface associated with the first user. A location associated with at least one media content item in the first subset can be determined. The location can be provided on the map.

In an embodiment the first user and the second user can be a same user of the social networking system. The selection criteria can specify that each media content item in the first subset is to at least meet a threshold level of relevance with respect to the first user.

In an embodiment the threshold level of relevance can be determined based on at least one of a relationship of the first user a connection of the first user an interest of the first user an event associated with the first user an interaction associated with the first user or a post provided by the first user.

In an embodiment the first user and the second user can be different users of the social networking system. The first user and the second user can be directly connected in the social networking system. The selection criteria can specify that each media content item in the first subset is to be associated with both the first user and the second user.

In an embodiment each media content item in the first subset can correspond to at least one of a media content item provided by the first user and that has a tag of the second user a media content item provided by the second user and that has a tag of the first user or a media content item that has the tag of the first user and the tag of the second user.

In an embodiment the first user and the second user can be different users of the social networking system. The first user and the second user can be indirectly connected via at least one common connection in the social networking system. The selection criteria can specify that each media content item in the first subset is to be associated with both the first user and the at least one common connection.

In an embodiment each media content item in the first subset can correspond to at least one of a media content item provided by the first user and that has a tag of the at least one common connection a media content item provided by the at least one common connection and that has a tag of the first user or a media content item that has the tag of the first user and the tag of the at least one common connection.

A media access interface associated with the third user can be provided. A graphical element can be provided to navigate to a first time frame in the set of time frames associated with the first subset. A second time frame in the media access interface associated with the third user can be navigated to. The second time frame can be within an allowable time deviation from the first time frame.

Many other features and embodiments of the invention will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the following detailed description.

The figures depict various embodiments of the disclosed technology for purposes of illustration only wherein the figures use like reference numerals to identify like elements. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated in the figures can be employed without departing from the principles of the disclosed technology described herein.

People use social networking systems or services for various purposes. Users of a social networking system can utilize their computing devices or systems to establish connections communicate and interact with one another via the social networking system. Users can also provide edit share or access media content items such as pictures videos audio and text. In one example a user of the social networking service can post or publish image content items which can be presented on a profile page of the user such as on a timeline which includes one or more collections of image content items associated with the user. The user s social connections for example can access view or interact with such image content items posted on the profile page e.g. timeline of the user as long as the user s privacy settings allow so.

Conventional approaches generally provide access to media content items associated with the user in an uninteresting manner. In one example different users who attempt to view the user s media content items can be presented with the same media content items depending on the user s privacy settings. As such conventional approaches to providing access to media content items can be predictable and static. Furthermore conventional approaches can provide access to media content items in an inefficient manner. For example under conventional approaches media content items provided or uploaded by the user can be stored organized and presented separately from media content items in which or with which the user is tagged. This can create challenges for searching or browsing through the media content items.

Therefore an improved approach to providing access to media content items can be beneficial for addressing or alleviating various concerns associated with conventional approaches. Various embodiments of the present disclosure can dynamically select content based on relevancy content and or other selection criteria. Access to the dynamically selected content can be provided. In one example a friend of the user can attempt to access the user s images and can be presented with media content items that are associated with both the friend and the user. In another example another user indirectly connected to the user via a mutual friend can attempt to access the user s images and can be presented with media content items that are associated with both the mutual friend and the user. It is contemplated that many other uses applications and or variations are possible.

The content identification module can be configured to identify a set of media content items associated with a first user of a social networking system. The set of media content item can include but is not limited to images videos audio and or text associated with the first user of the social networking system. The set of media content item can be associated with the first user in that the media content items can be provided by the first user and or the first user can be tagged with the media content items. For example the set of media content items can include all images and videos uploaded or posted by the first user. The set of media content items can also include all images and videos in which the first user is tagged. The set of media content items can further include all images and videos for which the first user is tagged as being with such as content posted by a posting user who tagged the first user as being with the posted content with the posting user at the time the content was created and or with the posting user at the time the content was posted etc.

In some implementations the set of media content items and or one or more specified subsets of the set can be accessible to users other than the first user based on one or more settings of the first user such as privacy settings. For example the first user can set the settings to specify that only the first user s social connections or friends within the social networking system can access or view the set of media content items and or the one or more specified subsets. In another example the settings can specify that only particular users can access particular media content items associated with the first user. Many variations are possible.

In some embodiments the content access module can be configured to determine that a second user of the social networking system is attempting to access at least a portion of the set of media content items associated with the first user. For example the content access module can detect or receive a command from the second user to access at least some of the first user s media content items. In some implementations the set of media content items associated with the first user can be provided via a media access interface associated with the first user. In some cases the media access interface can be provided via a profile or timeline of the first user. The content access module can detect an interaction or command e.g. a click a tap etc. from the second user to access one or more of the first user s media content items via the media access interface.

Moreover the dynamic subset selection module can be configured to dynamically select a first subset of media content items out of the set of media content items. Each media content item in the first subset can be selected to be a media content item that satisfies specified selection criteria. The selection of the first subset can be dynamic in that the selection criteria can be modified or adjusted dynamically. In some cases the dynamic modifying or adjusting of the selection criteria can be based on information associated with at least one of the first user the second user and or at least a portion of the set of media content items. The dynamic subset selection module will be discussed in more detail below.

The content access module can be configured to provide the second user with access to a representation of the first subset of media content items. The representation of the first subset can be provided for example in the media access interface associated with the first user. In some cases the representation of the first subset can include a summary a highlight and or a preview of the first subset of media content items.

As discussed in some embodiments the selection criteria can be adjusted or modified dynamically which can be based on information associated with at least one of the first user the second user or at least a portion of the set of media content items. The image classification module can be configured to acquire at least some of the information. In some cases the information can be based on image classification applied to the at least the portion of the set of media content items such as to one or more media content items in the first subset. In some implementations the information as well as other data can be stored and acquired from the at least one data store .

In some embodiments classification analysis can be performed on content items by the image classification module to determine their potential relevance with a particular subject topic and or theme. The classification analysis can be based on myriad techniques for example. Content items constituting or including images or text can be analyzed and classified based on any suitable processing technique. For example an image classification technique can gather contextual cues for a sample set of images and use the contextual cues to generate a training set of images. The training set of images can be used to train a classifier to generate visual pattern templates of an image class. The classifier can score an evaluation set of images based on correlation with the visual pattern templates. The highest scoring images of the evaluation set of images can be deemed to be mostly closely related to the image class. As another example a hint detection technique can include natural language processing NLP to assist in identifying hints in comments associated with an image. The NLP based hint detection technique can identify based at least in part on natural language processing one or more tokens in a comment that can assist in determining the subject matter of an image. Other suitable techniques are possible.

Moreover the social graph module can also be configured to acquire at least some of the information associated with the at least one of the first user the second user or the at least the portion of the set of media content items. In some cases the information can include social graph data associated with the at least one of the first user the second user or the at least the portion of set of media content items. In some implementations the information as well as other data can be stored and acquired from the at least one data store . More details related to social graphs will be discussed below.

As discussed above it can be determined that a second user of a social networking system is attempting to access at least a portion of a set of media content items associated with a first user. The dynamic subset selection module can be configured to facilitate dynamically selecting a first subset of media content items out of the set of media content items. Each media content item selected to be included in the first subset can satisfy specified selection criteria.

In some instances the first user and the second user can be a same user of the social networking system. For example it can be determined that the first user is attempting to access his or her own media content items. Accordingly the relevance module can dynamically adjust the selection criteria to specify that each media content item selected to be included in the first subset of media content items should at least meet a threshold level of relevance with respect to the first user.

In some embodiments the relevance module can also be configured to determine the threshold level of relevance. The threshold level of relevance can be determined for example based on at least one of a relationship of the first user a connection of the first user an interest of the first user an event associated with the first user an interaction associated with the first user or a post provided by the first user. In some cases at least some of the information related to relationships of the first user connections of the first user interests of the first user events associated with the first user interactions associated with the first user and or posts provided by the first user can be acquired or determined based on social graph data. Furthermore in some cases at least some of the information can be acquired or determined based on image classification of at least some media content items.

In one example the selection criteria can specify that the threshold level of relevance for image content items is met when the image content items are associated with e.g. provided by and or tagged with etc. the first user and a user with whom the first user is in a relationship. In another example the selection criteria can specify that the threshold level of relevance for image content items is met when the image content items are associated with e.g. provided by and or tagged with etc. the first user and a user with whom the first user is in a relationship associated with a time period corresponding to the past 30 days and associated with a location corresponding to San Francisco Calif. In a further example the selection criteria can specify that the threshold level of relevance for image content items is met when the image content items are associated with dogs which can be determined based on image classification and or other relevant data e.g. tags comments likes etc. . As such when the first user accesses his or her own media content items the first user can be presented with the most relevant content which can be updated dynamically. Numerous variations are possible.

In some implementations the selection criteria and or the threshold level of relevance can be set by the first user. In some embodiments the selection criteria and or the threshold level of relevance can be determined for the first user based on social graph data associated with the first user such as based on patterns or trends indicative of what types of content items the first user likely wants to provide post and or access.

In some cases the first user and the second user can be different users of the social networking system and can be directly connected in the social networking system. The direct connection module can dynamically adjust the selection criteria accordingly to specify that each media content item in the first subset should be associated with both the first user and the second user. For example each media content item in the first subset can correspond to at least one of a media content item provided by the first user and that has a tag of the second user a media content item provided by the second user and that has a tag of the first user or a media content item that has the tag of the first user and the tag of the second user.

In one example the second user can be a social connection or friend of the first user within the social networking system. Assuming that the first user s privacy settings so allow when the second user attempts to access at least some of the media content items associated with the first user the direction connection module can present the second user with the first subset of media content. In this example media content items in the first subset are selected to not only be associated with the first user but also with the second user.

In some instances the first user and the second user can be different users of the social networking system and can be indirectly connected via at least one common connection in the social networking system. The indirect connection module can dynamically adjust the selection criteria accordingly to specify that each media content item in the first subset should be associated with both the first user and the at least one common connection. For example each media content item in the first subset can correspond to at least one of a media content item provided by the first user and that has a tag of the at least one common connection a media content item provided by the at least one common connection and that has a tag of the first user or a media content item that has the tag of the first user and the tag of the at least one common connection.

In one example the second user can be a friend of a friend of the first user within the social networking system. In other words the second user and the first user may not be friends but can have a mutual friend. Assuming that the first user s privacy settings so allow when the second user attempts to access at least some of the media content items associated with the first user the indirection connection module can present the second user with the first subset of media content items. In this example the first subset can be selected to include media content items that are associated with the first user and also with the mutual friend.

In the example of User A is friends with User B . User B is friends with User C . However User A and User C are not friends within the social networking system but have User B as a mutual friend. In this example User A has been tagged in Image A such as by another user not explicitly shown in . In this example User A has uploaded Image B and Image C . User A has also tagged User B in Image B . Moreover User A has tagged himself or herself in Image C .

In one example it is assumed that User A s privacy settings allow users up to and including friends of friends to view User A s images which is the set of Image A Image B and Image C . In this example when User B tries to access User A s images Image B can be selected to be in a first subset of media content items to be provided to User B . This can be because Image B is associated with both User A and User B . As such User B can be provided with Image B as a first priority. As User B browses past Image B Image A and Image C can be included as part of a second subset of media content items to be provided to User B at a lower priority. Moreover when User C tries to access User A s images Image B can also be selected to be in a first subset of media content items to be provided to User C . This can be because Image B is associated with both User A and the mutual friend User B of User A and User C . As such User C can be provided with Image B as a first priority. As User C further browses past Image B Image A and Image C can be included as part of a second subset of media content items to be provided to User C at a lower priority.

As discussed above it can be determined that a second user of the social networking system is attempting to access at least a portion of a set of media content items associated with the first user. The first subset of media content items can be dynamically selected out of the set of media content items. Each media content item selected to be included in the first subset can satisfy specified selection criteria. The second user can be provided with access to the representation of the first subset of media content items. The representation of the first subset can be provided in the media access interface associated with the first user. In some cases a representation of a respective subset can include a summary a highlight or a preview of the respective subset.

In some embodiments it can be determined that at least a second subset of media content items out of the set of media content items fails to satisfy the specified selection criteria. It can be determined that the at least the second subset is accessible to the second user based on one or more privacy settings of the first user. The second user can be provided with access to the representation of the second subset of media content items. In some cases the representation of the first subset can be provided at a first position in the media access interface. The representation of the second subset can be provided at a second position in the media access interface. The second position can be lower in positional priority than the first position . As shown in the example of the first position for the representation of the first subset can be vertically higher than the second position for the representation of the second subset.

Moreover although not explicitly shown in in some embodiments it can be determined that at least a third subset of media content items out of the set of media content items fails to satisfy the specified selection criteria. It can be determined that the at least the third subset is accessible to the second user based on the one or more privacy settings of the first user. The second user can be provided with access to a representation of the third subset of media content items. In some cases the representation of the third subset can be provided at a third position in the media access interface. The third position can be lower in positional priority than the second position .

Although the third subset and its representation are not explicitly shown in the example of the second position for the second subset can be vertically higher than the third position for the third subset when the second subset is associated with a more recent time frame than the third subset.

In some embodiments each of the second subset and the third subset is associated with at least one of a story a post an event or an album.

Furthermore in the example of the first user and the second user can correspond to the same user e.g. a single user User A . As such a title bar for the media access interface can include a title stating My Photos .

In some embodiments a vertical scroll element can be provided for navigating among at least the representation of the first subset the representation of the second subset the representation of the third subset not explicitly shown and so forth. In some instances a first scroll element position in the vertical scroll element can correspond to the first position in the media access interface a second scroll element position in the vertical scroll element can correspond to the second position in the media access interface and a third scroll element position in the vertical scroll element can correspond to the third position in the media access interface and so forth.

Moreover in some implementations a first title can be provided and displayed for the first subset at the first scroll element position while a second title can be provided and displayed for the second subset at the second scroll element position and a third title can be provided and displayed for the third subset at the third scroll element position and so forth.

In some embodiments an interaction initiated by the second user with respect to the representation of the first subset can be received. It can be determined that an entirety of the first subset is accessible to the second user based on one or more privacy settings of the first user. The second user can be provided with access to the entirety of the first subset subsequent to the receiving of the interaction. As shown in the entirety of the first subset can include information provided about the first subset as well as enlarged versions e.g. image image etc. of media content items in the first subset.

In some instances the information about the first subset can include but is not limited to at least one of a set of time frames associated with the first subset a set of users associated with the first subset or a set of locations associated with the first subset.

Similar to and in the example of the first user and the second user can correspond to the same user e.g. a single user User A . As such a title bar for the media access interface can include a title stating My Photos .

In this example the first and second users User A and User B are friends and thus connected in the social networking system. As such the first subset of media content items can include media content items associated with both the first user and the second user. The representation of the first subset of media content items can be presented in a higher positional priority than that of the representation of the second subset. In some embodiments the representation of the second subset as well as a third subset a fourth subset etc. can be presented in chronological order from most recent to least recent.

In some embodiments it can be determined that the second user User A is attempting to interact with the third user User C who can be included in a set of users associated with the first subset of the first user User B . A media access interface associated with the third user can be provided to the second user. A first subset e.g. associated with a representation of media content items of the third user can include images associated with both the third user and the first user since the second user is not friends with the third user. Also a representation of a second subset of the third user can be presented in a lower positional priority than the representation of the first subset of the third user.

Moreover in some embodiments a graphical element can be provided to navigate to a first time frame e.g. Oct. 31 2013 in in a set of time frames associated with the first subset of the first user. A second time frame e.g. October 2013 in graphical element in the media access interface associated with the third user can be navigated to. The second time frame can be within an allowable time deviation from the first time frame e.g. both within the same month .

At block the example method can identify a set of media content items associated with a first user of a social networking system. At block the example method can determine that a second user of the social networking system is attempting to access at least a portion of the set of media content items associated with the first user. At block the example method can dynamically select a first subset of media content items out of the set of media content items. In some cases each media content item in the first subset can satisfy specified selection criteria. At block the example method can provide the second user with access to a representation of the first subset of media content items. In some cases the representation of the first subset can be provided in a media access interface associated with the first user.

In some embodiments the media access interface can correspond to a browsing interface for accessing media based on social graph data. The media access interface can allow for navigation of media content based on relationships between media content items people time and or places.

In some embodiments the media access interface can be initiated via a launcher shortcut and or icon on a desktop screen or home screen of a computing device. In some embodiments the media access interface can replace an image section of a profile or timeline in the social networking system. In some embodiments the media access interface can be implemented as an application or software such as a mobile app.

In some embodiments the media access interface can provide one or more options to filter media content items. For example there can be one or more options to present a user s photo stories the user s photo albums and or photos of the user.

Furthermore in some embodiments a map can be provided in the media access interface associated with the first user. A location associated with at least one media content item in the first subset can be determined. The location can be provided on the map.

Again it is contemplated that there can be many other uses applications and or variations associated with the various embodiments of the present disclosure. For example various embodiments of the present disclosure can learn improve and or be refined over time.

The external system includes one or more web servers that include one or more web pages which are communicated to the user device using the network . The external system is separate from the social networking system . For example the external system is associated with a first domain while the social networking system is associated with a separate social networking domain. Web pages included in the external system comprise markup language documents identifying content and including instructions specifying formatting or presentation of the identified content.

The social networking system includes one or more computing devices for a social network including a plurality of users and providing users of the social network with the ability to communicate and interact with other users of the social network. In some instances the social network can be represented by a graph i.e. a data structure including edges and nodes. Other data structures can also be used to represent the social network including but not limited to databases objects classes meta elements files or any other data structure. The social networking system may be administered managed or controlled by an operator. The operator of the social networking system may be a human being an automated application or a series of applications for managing content regulating policies and collecting usage metrics within the social networking system . Any type of operator may be used.

Users may join the social networking system and then add connections to any number of other users of the social networking system to whom they desire to be connected. As used herein the term friend refers to any other user of the social networking system to whom a user has formed a connection association or relationship via the social networking system . For example in an embodiment if users in the social networking system are represented as nodes in the social graph the term friend can refer to an edge formed between and directly connecting two user nodes.

Connections may be added explicitly by a user or may be automatically created by the social networking system based on common characteristics of the users e.g. users who are alumni of the same educational institution . For example a first user specifically selects a particular other user to be a friend. Connections in the social networking system are usually in both directions but need not be so the terms user and friend depend on the frame of reference. Connections between users of the social networking system are usually bilateral two way or mutual but connections may also be unilateral or one way. For example if Bob and Joe are both users of the social networking system and connected to each other Bob and Joe are each other s connections. If on the other hand Bob wishes to connect to Joe to view data communicated to the social networking system by Joe but Joe does not wish to form a mutual connection a unilateral connection may be established. The connection between users may be a direct connection however some embodiments of the social networking system allow the connection to be indirect via one or more levels of connections or degrees of separation.

In addition to establishing and maintaining connections between users and allowing interactions between users the social networking system provides users with the ability to take actions on various types of items supported by the social networking system . These items may include groups or networks i.e. social networks of people entities and concepts to which users of the social networking system may belong events or calendar entries in which a user might be interested computer based applications that a user may use via the social networking system transactions that allow users to buy or sell items via services provided by or through the social networking system and interactions with advertisements that a user may perform on or off the social networking system . These are just a few examples of the items upon which a user may act on the social networking system and many others are possible. A user may interact with anything that is capable of being represented in the social networking system or in the external system separate from the social networking system or coupled to the social networking system via the network .

The social networking system is also capable of linking a variety of entities. For example the social networking system enables users to interact with each other as well as external systems or other entities through an API a web service or other communication channels. The social networking system generates and maintains the social graph comprising a plurality of nodes interconnected by a plurality of edges. Each node in the social graph may represent an entity that can act on another node and or that can be acted on by another node. The social graph may include various types of nodes. Examples of types of nodes include users non person entities content items web pages groups activities messages concepts and any other things that can be represented by an object in the social networking system . An edge between two nodes in the social graph may represent a particular kind of connection or association between the two nodes which may result from node relationships or from an action that was performed by one of the nodes on the other node. In some cases the edges between nodes can be weighted. The weight of an edge can represent an attribute associated with the edge such as a strength of the connection or association between nodes. Different types of edges can be provided with different weights. For example an edge created when one user likes another user may be given one weight while an edge created when a user befriends another user may be given a different weight.

As an example when a first user identifies a second user as a friend an edge in the social graph is generated connecting a node representing the first user and a second node representing the second user. As various nodes relate or interact with each other the social networking system modifies edges connecting the various nodes to reflect the relationships and interactions.

The social networking system also includes user generated content which enhances a user s interactions with the social networking system . User generated content may include anything a user can add upload send or post to the social networking system . For example a user communicates posts to the social networking system from a user device . Posts may include data such as status updates or other textual data location information images such as photos videos links music or other similar data and or media. Content may also be added to the social networking system by a third party. Content items are represented as objects in the social networking system . In this way users of the social networking system are encouraged to communicate with each other by posting text and content items of various types of media through various communication channels. Such communication increases the interaction of users with each other and increases the frequency with which users interact with the social networking system .

The social networking system includes a web server an API request server a user profile store a connection store an action logger an activity log and an authorization server . In an embodiment of the invention the social networking system may include additional fewer or different components for various applications. Other components such as network interfaces security mechanisms load balancers failover servers management and network operations consoles and the like are not shown so as to not obscure the details of the system.

The user profile store maintains information about user accounts including biographic demographic and other types of descriptive information such as work experience educational history hobbies or preferences location and the like that has been declared by users or inferred by the social networking system . This information is stored in the user profile store such that each user is uniquely identified. The social networking system also stores data describing one or more connections between different users in the connection store . The connection information may indicate users who have similar or common work experience group memberships hobbies or educational history. Additionally the social networking system includes user defined connections between different users allowing users to specify their relationships with other users. For example user defined connections allow users to generate relationships with other users that parallel the users real life relationships such as friends co workers partners and so forth. Users may select from predefined types of connections or define their own connection types as needed. Connections with other nodes in the social networking system such as non person entities buckets cluster centers images interests pages external systems concepts and the like are also stored in the connection store .

The social networking system maintains data about objects with which a user may interact. To maintain this data the user profile store and the connection store store instances of the corresponding type of objects maintained by the social networking system . Each object type has information fields that are suitable for storing information appropriate to the type of object. For example the user profile store contains data structures with fields suitable for describing a user s account and information related to a user s account. When a new object of a particular type is created the social networking system initializes a new data structure of the corresponding type assigns a unique object identifier to it and begins to add data to the object as needed. This might occur for example when a user becomes a user of the social networking system the social networking system generates a new instance of a user profile in the user profile store assigns a unique identifier to the user account and begins to populate the fields of the user account with information provided by the user.

The connection store includes data structures suitable for describing a user s connections to other users connections to external systems or connections to other entities. The connection store may also associate a connection type with a user s connections which may be used in conjunction with the user s privacy setting to regulate access to information about the user. In an embodiment of the invention the user profile store and the connection store may be implemented as a federated database.

Data stored in the connection store the user profile store and the activity log enables the social networking system to generate the social graph that uses nodes to identify various objects and edges connecting nodes to identify relationships between different objects. For example if a first user establishes a connection with a second user in the social networking system user accounts of the first user and the second user from the user profile store may act as nodes in the social graph. The connection between the first user and the second user stored by the connection store is an edge between the nodes associated with the first user and the second user. Continuing this example the second user may then send the first user a message within the social networking system . The action of sending the message which may be stored is another edge between the two nodes in the social graph representing the first user and the second user. Additionally the message itself may be identified and included in the social graph as another node connected to the nodes representing the first user and the second user.

In another example a first user may tag a second user in an image that is maintained by the social networking system or alternatively in an image maintained by another system outside of the social networking system . The image may itself be represented as a node in the social networking system . This tagging action may create edges between the first user and the second user as well as create an edge between each of the users and the image which is also a node in the social graph. In yet another example if a user confirms attending an event the user and the event are nodes obtained from the user profile store where the attendance of the event is an edge between the nodes that may be retrieved from the activity log . By generating and maintaining the social graph the social networking system includes data describing many different types of objects and the interactions and connections among those objects providing a rich source of socially relevant information.

The web server links the social networking system to one or more user devices and or one or more external systems via the network . The web server serves web pages as well as other web related content such as Java JavaScript Flash XML and so forth. The web server may include a mail server or other messaging functionality for receiving and routing messages between the social networking system and one or more user devices . The messages can be instant messages queued messages e.g. email text and SMS messages or any other suitable messaging format.

The API request server allows one or more external systems and user devices to call access information from the social networking system by calling one or more API functions. The API request server may also allow external systems to send information to the social networking system by calling APIs. The external system in one embodiment sends an API request to the social networking system via the network and the API request server receives the API request. The API request server processes the request by calling an API associated with the API request to generate an appropriate response which the API request server communicates to the external system via the network . For example responsive to an API request the API request server collects data associated with a user such as the user s connections that have logged into the external system and communicates the collected data to the external system . In another embodiment the user device communicates with the social networking system via APIs in the same manner as external systems .

The action logger is capable of receiving communications from the web server about user actions on and or off the social networking system . The action logger populates the activity log with information about user actions enabling the social networking system to discover various actions taken by its users within the social networking system and outside of the social networking system . Any action that a particular user takes with respect to another node on the social networking system may be associated with each user s account through information maintained in the activity log or in a similar database or other data repository. Examples of actions taken by a user within the social networking system that are identified and stored may include for example adding a connection to another user sending a message to another user reading a message from another user viewing content associated with another user attending an event posted by another user posting an image attempting to post an image or other actions interacting with another user or another object. When a user takes an action within the social networking system the action is recorded in the activity log . In one embodiment the social networking system maintains the activity log as a database of entries. When an action is taken within the social networking system an entry for the action is added to the activity log . The activity log may be referred to as an action log.

Additionally user actions may be associated with concepts and actions that occur within an entity outside of the social networking system such as an external system that is separate from the social networking system . For example the action logger may receive data describing a user s interaction with an external system from the web server . In this example the external system reports a user s interaction according to structured actions and objects in the social graph.

Other examples of actions where a user interacts with an external system include a user expressing an interest in an external system or another entity a user posting a comment to the social networking system that discusses an external system or a web page within the external system a user posting to the social networking system a Uniform Resource Locator URL or other identifier associated with an external system a user attending an event associated with an external system or any other action by a user that is related to an external system . Thus the activity log may include actions describing interactions between a user of the social networking system and an external system that is separate from the social networking system .

The authorization server enforces one or more privacy settings of the users of the social networking system . A privacy setting of a user determines how particular information associated with a user can be shared. The privacy setting comprises the specification of particular information associated with a user and the specification of the entity or entities with whom the information can be shared. Examples of entities with which information can be shared may include other users applications external systems or any entity that can potentially access the information. The information that can be shared by a user comprises user account information such as profile photos phone numbers associated with the user user s connections actions taken by the user such as adding a connection changing user profile information and the like.

The privacy setting specification may be provided at different levels of granularity. For example the privacy setting may identify specific information to be shared with other users the privacy setting identifies a work phone number or a specific set of related information such as personal information including profile photo home phone number and status. Alternatively the privacy setting may apply to all the information associated with the user. The specification of the set of entities that can access particular information can also be specified at various levels of granularity. Various sets of entities with which information can be shared may include for example all friends of the user all friends of friends all applications or all external systems . One embodiment allows the specification of the set of entities to comprise an enumeration of entities. For example the user may provide a list of external systems that are allowed to access certain information. Another embodiment allows the specification to comprise a set of entities along with exceptions that are not allowed to access the information. For example a user may allow all external systems to access the user s work information but specify a list of external systems that are not allowed to access the work information. Certain embodiments call the list of exceptions that are not allowed to access certain information a block list . External systems belonging to a block list specified by a user are blocked from accessing the information specified in the privacy setting. Various combinations of granularity of specification of information and granularity of specification of entities with which information is shared are possible. For example all personal information may be shared with friends whereas all work information may be shared with friends of friends.

The authorization server contains logic to determine if certain information associated with a user can be accessed by a user s friends external systems and or other applications and entities. The external system may need authorization from the authorization server to access the user s more private and sensitive information such as the user s work phone number. Based on the user s privacy settings the authorization server determines if another user the external system an application or another entity is allowed to access information associated with the user including information about actions taken by the user.

In some embodiments the social networking system can include a content access module . The content access module can for example be implemented as the content access module of . The content access module can be configured to facilitate identifying a set of media content items associated with a first user of a social networking system. The content access module can be configured to facilitate determining that a second user of the social networking system is attempting to access at least a portion of the set of media content items associated with the first user. The content access module can also be configured to facilitate dynamically selecting a first subset of media content items out of the set of media content items. In some cases each media content item in the first subset can satisfy specified selection criteria. The content access module can further be configured to facilitate providing the second user with access to a representation of the first subset of media content items. In some instances the representation of the first subset can be provided in a media access interface associated with the first user. It is understood that many variations are possible.
