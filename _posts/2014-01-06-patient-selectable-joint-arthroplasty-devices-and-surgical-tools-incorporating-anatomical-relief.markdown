The present disclosure relates to orthopedic methods systems and prosthetic devices and more particularly relates to methods systems and devices for joint replacement and articular resurfacing that incorporate anatomical relief surfaces and or other features. The present disclosure also includes surgical tools and or molds incorporating anatomical relief features that are designed to achieve optimal cut planes in a joint in preparation for installation of a joint implant.

There are various types of cartilage e.g. hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage. Hyaline cartilage is found at the articular surfaces of bones e.g. in the joints and is responsible for providing the smooth gliding motion characteristic of moveable joints. Articular cartilage is firmly attached to the underlying bones and measures typically less than 5 mm in thickness in human joints with considerable variation depending on joint and site within the joint. In addition articular cartilage is aneural avascular and alymphatic. In adult humans this cartilage derives its nutrition by a double diffusion system through the synovial membrane and through the dense matrix of the cartilage to reach the chondrocyte the cells that are found in the connective tissue of cartilage.

Adult cartilage has a limited ability of repair thus damage to cartilage produced by disease such as rheumatoid and or osteoarthritis or trauma can lead to serious physical deformity and debilitation. Furthermore as human articular cartilage ages its tensile properties change. The superficial zone of the knee articular cartilage exhibits an increase in tensile strength up to the third decade of life after which it decreases markedly with age as detectable damage to type II collagen occurs at the articular surface. The deep zone cartilage also exhibits a progressive decrease in tensile strength with increasing age although collagen content does not appear to decrease. These observations indicate that there are changes in mechanical and hence structural organization of cartilage with aging that if sufficiently developed can predispose cartilage to traumatic damage.

For example the superficial zone of the knee articular cartilage exhibits an increase in tensile strength up to the third decade of life after which it decreases markedly with age as detectable damage to type II collagen occurs at the articular surface. The deep zone cartilage also exhibits a progressive decrease in tensile strength with increasing age although collagen content does not appear to decrease. These observations indicate that there are changes in mechanical and hence structural organization of cartilage with aging that if sufficiently developed can predispose cartilage to traumatic damage.

Once damage occurs joint repair can be addressed through a number of approaches. One approach includes the use of matrices tissue scaffolds or other carriers implanted with cells e.g. chondrocytes chondrocyte progenitors stromal cells mesenchymal stem cells etc. . These solutions have been described as a potential treatment for cartilage and meniscal repair or replacement. However clinical outcomes with biologic replacement materials such as allograft and autograft systems and tissue scaffolds have been uncertain since most of these materials cannot achieve a morphologic arrangement or structure similar to or identical to that of normal disease free human tissue it is intended to replace. Moreover the mechanical durability of these biologic replacement materials remains uncertain.

Usually severe damage or loss of cartilage is treated by replacement of the joint with a prosthetic material for example silicone e.g. for cosmetic repairs or metal alloys. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 383 228 to Schmotzer issued May 7 2002 U.S. Pat. No. 6 203 576 to Afriat et al. issued Mar. 20 2001 U.S. Pat. No. 6 126 690 to Ateshian et al. issued Oct. 3 2000. Implantation of these prosthetic devices is usually associated with loss of underlying tissue and bone without recovery of the full function allowed by the original cartilage and with some devices serious long term complications associated with the loss of significant amount of tissue and bone can include infection osteolysis and also loosening of the implant.

Further joint arthroplasties are highly invasive and often require surgical resection of the entirety or the majority of the articular surface of one or more bones. With these procedures the marrow space is often reamed in order to fit the stem of the prosthesis. The reaming results in a loss of the patient s bone stock. U.S. Pat. No. 5 593 450 to Scott et al. issued Jan. 14 1997 discloses an oval domed shaped patella prosthesis. The prosthesis has a femoral component that includes two condyles as articulating surfaces. The two condyles meet to form a second trochlear groove and ride on a tibial component that articulates with respect to the femoral component. A patella component is provided to engage the trochlear groove. U.S. Pat. No. 6 090 144 to Letot et al. issued Jul. 18 2000 discloses a knee prosthesis that includes a tibial component and a meniscal component that is adapted to be engaged with the tibial component through an asymmetrical engagement.

Another joint subject to invasive joint procedures is the hip. U.S. Pat. No. 6 262 948 to Storer et al. issued Sep. 30 2003 discloses a femoral hip prosthesis that replaces the natural femoral head. U.S. Patent Publications 2002 0143402 A1 and 2003 0120347 to Steinberg published Oct. 3 2002 and Jun. 26 2003 respectively also disclose a hip prosthesis that replaces the femoral head and provides a member for communicating with the ball portion of the socket within the hip joint.

A variety of materials can be used in replacing a joint with a prosthetic for example silicone e.g. for cosmetic repairs or suitable metal alloys are appropriate. Implantation of these prosthetic devices is usually associated with loss of underlying tissue and bone and with some devices serious long term complications associated with the loss of significant amounts of tissue and bone can cause loosening of the implant. One such complication is osteolysis. Once the prosthesis becomes loosened from the joint regardless of the cause the prosthesis will then often be required to be replaced. Since the patient s bone stock is limited the number of possible replacement surgeries is also limited for joint arthroplasty.

As can be appreciated joint arthroplasties are generally highly invasive procedures and can require surgical resection of the entirety or a majority of the articular surface of one or more bones involved in the repair. In many procedures the marrow space can be fairly extensively reamed in order to fit the stem of the prosthesis within the bone. Reaming results in a loss of the patient s bone stock and over time subsequent osteolysis will frequently lead to loosening of the prosthesis. Further the area where the implant and the bone mate degrades over time requiring the prosthesis to eventually be replaced. Since the patient s bone stock is limited the number of possible replacement surgeries can be limited for joint arthroplasty. In short over the course of 15 to 20 years and in some cases even shorter time periods the patient can run out of therapeutic options ultimately resulting in a painful non functional joint.

In the past a diseased injured or defective joint such as for example a joint exhibiting osteoarthritis was repaired using standard off the shelf implants and other surgical devices. Specific off the shelf implant designs have been altered over the years to address particular issues. For example several existing designs include implant components having rotating parts to enhance joint motion. Ries et al. describes design changes to the distal or posterior condyles of a femoral implant component to enhance axial rotation of the implant component during flexion. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 549 688 and 5 824 105. Andriacchi et al. describes a design change to the heights of the posterior condyles to enhance high flexion motion. See also U.S. Pat. No. 6 770 099. However in altering a design to address a particular issue historical design changes frequently have created one or more additional issues for future designs to address. Collectively many of these issues have arisen from one or more differences between a patient s existing joint anatomy and the corresponding features of an implant component.

Joint implants have historically employed a one size fits all or a few sizes fit all approach to implant design. A series of one or more standard implant shapes and or sizes is pre manufactured and stockpiled and then one or more of these implants selected for implantation in the patient. It has been common practice to modify the patient s anatomical support structures e.g. cut supporting bones and or other structures to accommodate a chosen implant and with a limited number of shapes and sizes to of implants choose from it is virtually guaranteed that the chosen implant will not be a perfect fit to the patient s anatomy. Rather the chosen implant is likely the best fit or best compromise available with the surgical procedure still requiring removal of significant bone and or other support tissues to accommodate the chosen implant size. Accordingly advanced implant designs and related devices and methods that address the needs of individual patient s are needed.

Moreover currently available devices do not optimally provide ideal alignment with the articular surfaces and the resultant joint congruity. Poor alignment and poor joint congruity can for example lead to instability of the joint. In the knee joint instability typically manifests as a lateral instability of the joint.

Thus there remains a need for compositions for joint repair including methods and compositions that facilitate the integration between the cartilage replacement system and the surrounding cartilage. There is also a need for tools that increase the accuracy of cuts made to the bone in a joint in preparation for surgical implantation of for example an artificial joint.

The embodiments described herein include advancements in or that arise out of the area of patient adapted articular implants that are tailored to address the needs of individual single patients. Such patient adapted articular implants offer advantages over the traditional one size fits all approach or a few sizes fit all approach. The advantages include for example better fit more natural movement of the joint reduction in the amount of bone removed during surgery and a less invasive procedure. Such patient adapted or patient specific articular implants can be created from images of the patient s joint. Based on the images patient adapted and or patient specific implant components can be selected and or designed to include features e.g. surface contours curvatures shapes widths lengths thicknesses and other features that match existing features in the single individual patient s joint as well as features that approximate an ideal and or healthy feature or a combination of patient adapted or patient specific and engineered features that may not exist in the patient prior to a procedure.

Patient adapted features can include patient specific and or patient engineered features. Patient specific or patient matched implant component or guide tool features can include features adapted to match one or more of the patient s biological features for example one or more biological anatomical structures alignments kinematics and or soft tissue features. Patient adapted can include one or more implant tool features that are modified to accommodate various patient anatomical features or features that are designed or chosen to substantially match a patient s anatomical features. Patient specific can include surface features that are a substantial negative of substantially mirror and or substantially conform to some of all of a patient s native anatomical features. Patient engineered or patient derived features of an implant component can be designed and or manufactured e.g. preoperatively designed and manufactured based on patient specific data to substantially enhance or improve one or more of the patient s anatomical and or biological features Patient engineered features can include implants and or surgical tools having features based on information derived from the patient s anatomy combined with information derived from non patient specific sources including anatomical databases of one or more individuals including averaged data from general population groups of similar age medical condition age activity level ethnicity geographic location height weight occupation etc. Patient engineered features can also include implants and or surgical tools having some features based on information derived from the patient s anatomy combined with other features designed or derived from non patient specific data including general engineering or performance knowledge and or criteria as well as general biomechanical data.

The patient adapted e.g. patient specific and or patient engineered implant components and guide tools described herein can be selected e.g. from a library designed e.g. preoperatively designed including optionally manufacturing the components instruments or tools and or selected and designed and or modified e.g. by selecting a blank component or tool having certain blank features and then altering the blank features to be patient adapted or patient specific or patient engineered . Moreover related methods such as designs and strategies for resectioning a patient s biological structure also can be selected and or designed. For example an implant component bone facing surface and a resectioning strategy for the corresponding bone facing surface can be selected and or designed together so that an implant component s bone facing surface matches the resected surface. Such resectioning approaches can be performed with saws blades burrs curettes and any other tool known in the art or designed in the future. The resectioning approaches can be implemented using free hand surgical navigation custom cutting jig or robot assisted approaches. In addition one or more guide tools optionally can be selected and or designed to facilitate the resection cuts that are predetermined in accordance with resectioning strategy and implant component selection and or design.

In various exemplary embodiments the implants and associated surgical tools incorporate surface features that can accommodate unusual unknown uncertain or distinctive anatomical features in addition to including surfaces that conform to corresponding patient specific and or surgically modified anatomical surfaces of the patient s underlying anatomical support structures. For example an implant and or surgical tool can include surfaces conforming to patient specific and or surgically modified anatomical surfaces of the patient s joint and further include a surface opening void and or other anatomical relief feature that accommodates or avoids one or more osteophytes on the surface of the targeted anatomical region. In various embodiments the anatomical relief surface of the implant tool can desirably avoid direct contact with the unusual unknown distinctive feature of the anatomical support structure. In other embodiments the anatomical relief surface can contact or otherwise engage with the unusual unknown distinctive surface feature.

In various instances it may be desirous to avoid eliminate minimize and or reduce implant tool contact with unusual unknown distinctive anatomical surface features such as osteophytes voids soft tissues and or other anatomical structures. Avoidance may be desirable because of load bearing constraints of the surface feature imaging difficulties that render surface characterizations inaccurate a desire to allow the features to heal or otherwise remodel or for many other reasons desired by the physician and or implant designers.

In various other instances it may be desirous to increase enhance and or augment implant tool contact with unusual distinctive anatomical surface features such as osteophytes voids soft tissues and or other anatomical structures. Enhancement may be desirable because of load bearing abilities of the surface feature ability of the feature to increase securement of the implant tool against lateral or sliding movement and or due to other desires to contact the implant tool as desired by the physician and or implant designers. Enhancement may further be desirable to engage the feature in a manner similar to a puzzle piece fit e.g. the mold or other tool or implant only fits one way onto the anatomical surface with the feature .

Various embodiments could also incorporate anatomical relief features that correspond to non surface features of the bone including features below the surface of the bone i.e. subsurface voids or cysts and or non surface features above the bone i.e. adjacent and or surrounding bones ligaments tendons muscles and or other soft tissues etc. .

The present disclosure describes novel devices and methods for replacing a portion e.g. diseased area and or area slightly larger than the diseased area of a joint e.g. cartilage and or bone with a non pliable non liquid e.g. hard implant material where the implant and or surgical tools achieve a near anatomic fit with the surrounding structures and tissues and where the implant and or tool further includes at least one anatomical relief.

The present disclosure describes systems methods and compositions for repairing joints particularly for repairing articular cartilage and for facilitating the integration of a wide variety of cartilage repair materials into a subject. Among other things the techniques described herein allow for the customization of cartilage repair material to suit a particular subject for example in terms of size cartilage thickness and or curvature. When the shape e.g. size thickness and or curvature of the articular cartilage surface is an exact or near anatomic fit with the non damaged cartilage or with the subject s original cartilage the success of repair is enhanced. The repair material can be shaped prior to implantation and such shaping can be based for example on electronic images that provide information regarding curvature or thickness of any normal cartilage surrounding the defect and or on curvature of the bone underlying the defect. Thus the current disclosure provides among other things for minimally invasive methods for partial joint replacement. The methods can facilitate only minimal or in some instances no loss in bone stock. Additionally unlike with current techniques the methods described herein can help to restore the integrity of the articular surface by achieving an exact or near anatomic match between the implant and the surrounding or adjacent cartilage and or subchondral bone.

Advantages of the various embodiments can include but are not limited to i customization of joint repair thereby enhancing the efficacy and comfort level for the patient following the repair procedure ii eliminating the need for a surgeon to measure the defect to be repaired intraoperatively in some embodiments iii eliminating the need for a surgeon to shape the material during the implantation procedure iv providing methods of evaluating curvature of the repair material based on bone or tissue images or based on intraoperative probing techniques v providing methods of repairing joints with only minimal or in some instances no loss in bone stock and vi improving postoperative joint congruity.

Thus the methods described herein allow for the design and use of joint repair material that more precisely fits the defect e.g. site of implantation and accordingly provides improved repair of the joint.

The methods and compositions described herein can be used to treat defects resulting from disease of the cartilage e.g. osteoarthritis bone damage cartilage damage trauma and or degeneration due to overuse or age. The various embodiments allow among other things a health practitioner to evaluate and treat such defects. The size volume and shape of the area of interest can include only the region of cartilage that has the defect but can also include contiguous parts of the cartilage surrounding the cartilage defect.

As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art size curvature and or thickness measurements can be obtained using any suitable technique. For example one dimensional two dimensional and or three dimensional measurements can be obtained using suitable mechanical means laser devices electromagnetic or optical tracking systems molds materials applied to the articular surface that harden and memorize the surface contour and or one or more imaging techniques known in the art. Measurements can be obtained non invasively and or intraoperatively e.g. using a probe or other surgical device . As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art the thickness of the repair device can vary at any given point depending upon the depth of the damage to the cartilage and or bone to be corrected at any particular location on an articular surface.

As illustrated in typically the process begins by first measuring the size of the area of diseased cartilage or cartilage loss as well the condition of the potential underlying bony anatomical support structure. Thereafter the user can optionally measure the thickness of adjacent cartilage . Once these steps are performed the curvature of the articular surface is measured . Alternatively the curvature of subchondral bone can be measured.

Once the size of the defect is known either an implant can be selected from a library or an implant can be generated based on the patient specific parameters obtained in the measurements and evaluation . Prior to installing the implant in the joint the implantation site is prepared and then the implant is installed . One or more of these steps can be repeated as necessary or desired as shown by the optional repeat steps and .

As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art imaging techniques suitable for measuring thickness and or curvature e.g. of cartilage and or bone or size of areas of diseased cartilage or cartilage loss include the use of x rays magnetic resonance imaging MRI computed tomography scanning CT also known as computerized axial tomography or CAT optical coherence tomography ultrasound imaging techniques and optical imaging techniques. See also International Patent Publication WO 02 22014 to Alexander et al. published Mar. 21 2002 U.S. Pat. No. 6 373 250 to Tsoref et al. issued Apr. 16 2002 and Vandeberg et al. 2002 222 430 436 . Contrast or other enhancing agents can be employed using any route of administration e.g. intravenous intra articular etc.

Based on the imaging performed the software may evaluate the fit of different implants and or surgical guide templates with regard to dimensions overall size and shape. The dimensions overall size and shape may be optimized with regard to cortical bone shape and dimensions cortical bone thickness endosteal bone shape size of marrow cavity articular surface shape and dimensions subchondral bone shape and dimensions or subchondral bone thickness. Thus for example an implant may either be custom made or selected from a number of pre manufactured implants that is optimized with regard to any of the following or combinations thereof AP dimensions and shape mediolateral dimensions and shape superoinferior dimensions and shape shape of the articulating surface shape and dimensions of the interface in contact with cortical bone shape and dimensions of intramedullary portions or components. These parameters may also be optimized for implant function e.g. for different degrees of joint flexion or extension or abduction or adduction or internal or external rotation.

In certain embodiments CT or MRI is used to assess tissue bone cartilage and any defects therein for example cartilage lesions or areas of diseased cartilage to obtain information on subchondral bone or cartilage degeneration and to provide morphologic or biochemical or biomechanical information about the area of damage. Specifically changes such as fissuring partial or full thickness cartilage loss and signal changes within residual cartilage can be detected using one or more of these methods. For discussions of the basic NMR principles and techniques see MRI Basic Principles and Applications Second Edition Mark A. Brown and Richard C. Semelka Wiley Liss Inc. 1999 . For a discussion of MRI including conventional T1 and T2 weighted spin echo imaging gradient recalled echo GRE imaging magnetization transfer contrast MTC imaging fast spin echo FSE imaging contrast enhanced imaging rapid acquisition relaxation enhancement RARE imaging gradient echo acquisition in the steady state GRASS and driven equilibrium Fourier transform DEFT imaging to obtain information on cartilage see Alexander et al. WO 02 22014. Other techniques include steady state free precision flexible equilibrium MRI and DESS. Thus in various embodiments the measurements produced are based on three dimensional images of the joint obtained as described in Alexander et al. WO 02 22014 or sets of two dimensional images ultimately yielding 3D information. Two dimensional and three dimensional images or maps of the cartilage alone or in combination with a movement pattern of the joint e.g. flexion extension translation and or rotation can be obtained. Three dimensional images can include information on movement patterns contact points contact zone of two or more opposing articular surfaces and movement of the contact point or zone during joint motion. Two and three dimensional images can include information on biochemical composition of the articular cartilage. In addition imaging techniques can be compared over time for example to provide up to date information on the shape and type of repair material needed.

Traditional CT and MRI scans utilize two dimensional cross sectional images acquired in different imaging planes to visualize complex three dimensional articular anatomy. With computed tomography these slices are typically acquired in the axial plane. The in plane resolution is typically on the order of 0.25 0.25 millimeters. The slice thickness may vary from one to five millimeters. Thus the resolution obtained with these imaging studies is not isotropic. Moreover the CT slices and similarly with MRI may be separated by one or more millimeters. This means that the resolution of the images is excellent within the imaging plane. However two to ten fold loss in image resolution can be encountered in a plane perpendicular to the slices acquired by the CT or MRI scanner. This limitation in resolution perpendicular to the imaging plane can result in inaccuracies in deriving the three dimensional shape of without limitation an implant and or a 3 D guidance template described in more detail below.

In accordance with one embodiment spiral CT imaging is utilized to acquire the images rather than standard CT technology. With recent CT technology slip ring technology is incorporated in the scanner. A slip ring is a circular contact with sliding brushes that allows the gantry to rotate continuously untethered by electrical wires. The use of slip ring technology eliminates the initial limitations at the end of each slice acquisition. Thus the rotating gantry is free to rotate continuously throughout the examination of a joint. A slip ring CT scanner design allows greater rotational velocities thereby shortening scan times. With a spiral CT scan data is acquired while the table is moving. As a result the x ray source moves in a spiral or helical rather than a circular pattern around the patient. The speed of the table motion relative to the rotation of the CT gantry is often a consideration for image quality in helical or spiral CT scanning. This parameter is call pitch. In one embodiment spiral CT scans will be acquired through the joint wherein these spiral CT scans afford a resolution that is isotropic for example 1 millimeter by 1 millimeter by 1 millimeter in x y and z direction or 0.75 0.75 0.75 millimeters in x y and z direction or 0.5 0.5 0.5 millimeters in x y and z direction or 0.25 0.25 0.25 millimeters in x y and z direction. Near isotropic data sets are also acceptable particularly if the maximum resolution in any one of the three special orientations does not exceed 1.5 millimeters or 1.0 millimeters or 0.75 millimeters or 0.5 millimeters. Thus the various embodiments recognize that the accuracy in placing a 3 D guidance template on an articular surface or shaping an implant can be greatly improved with isotropic or near isotropic data sets as compared to traditional 2 D slice based data sets derived from either CT or MRI or other imaging technologies. For example a knee joint scan data acquired with near isotropic resolution of 0.4 0.4 0.7 millimeters e.g. a resolution ratio of less than 2 1 between the different dimensions and resolution in all three dimensions may be more desirable than 1 mm will yield greater positional accuracy in placing a 3 D guidance template on the articular surface than scan data acquired using traditional CT scans for example with a scan resolution of 0.4 0.4 1.2 millimeters.

With MRI standard acquisition call sequences also result in two dimensional slices for displaying complex three dimensional articular anatomy. The two dimensional slices can be acquired using 2 D or 3 D Fourier transformation. After the 2 D or 3 D transform 2 D slices are available for image viewing and image processing. Of note typically the image resolution in the imaging plane will be two or more fold greater than the image resolution perpendicular to the primary imaging plane. Similar to CT this limitation in spatial resolution in the plane perpendicular to the imaging plane can result in inaccuracies in deriving and subsequently placing 3 D guidance molds. In one embodiment MRI data is acquired or processed so that the data used for generating the 3 D guidance mold or implant has isotropic or near isotropic resolution. For example isotropic or near isotropic resolution may be achieved by fusing two non parallel imaging planes acquired using standard 2 D or 3 D Fourier transform images registering them relative to each other and performing an image fusion see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 728 731 entitled FMIPIIMRI QIAUIN II hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety . Alternatively using latest generation scan technology for example with 3 D FSE 3 D DESS 3 D MENSA 3 D PAVA 3 D LAVA 3 D MERGE 3 D MEDIC imaging sequences multi channel coils high field magnets advanced gradient technology isotropic or near isotropic acquisition using 3 D Fourier transform can be obtained. Using such advanced imaging technology image resolution of 0.5 by 0.5 by 0.8 millimeters or greater may be obtained achieving near isotropic and even isotropic resolution with resolution in all three dimensions of less than 1 mm.

As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art imaging techniques can be combined if desired. For example C arm imaging or x ray fluoroscopy can be used for motion imaging while MRI can yield high resolution cartilage information. C arm imaging can be combined with intra articular contrast to visualize the cartilage.

Any of the imaging devices described herein can also be used intra operatively see also below for example using a hand held ultrasound and or optical probe to image the articular surface intra operatively.

Imaging can be used to determine the anatomical and biomechanical axes of an extremity associated with a joint which can then be used in creating an implant or surgical guide template or mold. Suitable tests include for example an x ray or an x ray combined with an MRI. Typically anatomical landmarks are identified on the imaging test results e.g. the x ray film and those landmarks are then utilized to directly or indirectly determine the desired axes. Thus for example if surgery is contemplated in a hip joint knee joint or ankle joint an x ray can be obtained. This x ray can be a weight bearing film of the extremity for example a full length leg film taken while the patient is standing. This film can be used to determine the femoral and tibial anatomical axes and to estimate the biomechanical axes. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art these processes for identifying e.g. anatomical and biomechanical axis of the joint can be applied to other joints without departing from the scope of the invention.

Anatomical and biomechanical axes can also be determined using other imaging modalities including but not limited to computed tomography and MRI. For example a CT scan can be obtained through the hip joint the knee joint and the ankle joint. Optionally the scan can be reformatted in the sagittal coronal or other planes. The CT images can then be utilized to identify anatomical landmarks and to determine the anatomical and biomechanical axes of the hip joint knee joint and or ankle joint.

Similarly an MRI scan can be obtained for this purpose. For example an MRI scan of the thigh and pelvic region can be obtained using a body coil or a torso phased array coil. A high resolution scan of the knee joint can be obtained using a dedicated extremity coil. A scan of the calf tibia region and the ankle joint can be obtained again using a body coil or a torso phased array coil. Anatomical landmarks can be identified in each joint on these scans and the anatomical and biomechanical axes can be estimated using this information.

In various embodiments the imaging scan can be extended for 5 cm 10 cm or more including 15 cm above and or below the joint thereby deriving anatomic information that can be used to derive the anatomic and biomechanical axis. For example an MRI or CT scan can be obtained through a knee joint. The scan can extend 15 cm above and below the joint. The mid femoral line and mid tibial line as well as other anatomic landmarks such as the femoral transepicondylar line or Whiteside line or posterior condylar line can be determined and can be used to estimate the anatomic and biomechanical axes. Thus in the example of a knee joint no additional scanning through the hip joint and ankle joints will be absolutely required.

With for example MRI even larger coverage may be obtained for example with a series of axial sagittal or coronal slices obtained with a large field of view e.g. 20 cm or more or 25 cm or more or 30 cm or more or cm or more. These large field of view scans can be utilized to estimate the anatomic and biomechanical axes as described above. In various situations they can lack information on the surface detail of the joint due to limitations in spatial resolution. A second or additional scan can be performed with high resolution e.g. with spatial resolution and x and y axis of less than 1.0 mm or less than 0.8 mm or less than 0.6 mm. The additional high resolution scan may be utilized to derive the articular surface detail adequate for a good and accurate fit between the guidance template or implant and the articular surface or adjacent structures.

A biomechanical axis and in some instances an anatomical axis may advantageously be defined by imaging the entire extremity in question. Such imaging may include cross sectional spiral or volumetric imaging via a CT or MRI scan or optical imaging through the entire extremity or acquisition of select images or slices or volumes through an area of interest such as a hip joint a knee joint or ankle joint.

In an illustrative embodiment scans through the entire or portions of an entire extremity covering multiple joints may be replaced with an extended scan through a single joint such as a knee joint. For example it may not be sufficient to estimate a biomechanical axis or an anatomical access with a standard knee scan such as a CT scan or MRI scan that includes for example only ten centimeter of the area or volume of interest above or ten centimeters of area or volume of interest below the tibiofemoral joints space. With an extended scan a larger area adjacent to the target joint can be included in the scan e.g. fifteen centimeters above and below the medial tibia femoral joint space twenty centimeters above and below the medial tibia femoral joint space fifteen centimeters above and twenty centimeters below the medial tibiofemoral joint space twenty centimeters above and twenty five centimeters below the medial tibiofemoral joint space. While the extended scan is less involved on the operative side than the scan involving the neighboring joints it can optionally be used to provide an estimate of the anatomical axis biomechanical axis and or an implant axes or related planes. Thus better ease of use is provided at the expense of possibly more radiation and possibly less accuracy.

In another embodiment cross sectional or volumetric images such as CT scans or MRI scans may be acquired through more than one joint typically one or more joints neighboring the one contemplated for surgery. For example CT or MRI slices CT spirals CT or MRI volumes MRI two plane acquisitions with optional image fusion or other tomographic acquisitions are acquired through the hip joint knee joint and ankle joint in a patient scheduled for total knee replacement surgery. The 3D surgical guidance templates may be optimized by using anatomic and or biomechanical information obtained in the adjacent neighboring joints for example resulting in an improved anatomic or functional result. By using cross sectional or volumetric imaging information more accurate identification of anatomic landmarks for identifying relevant anatomical and or biomechanical axis relevant planes including surgical planes and implant planes as well as implant axes can be achieved when compared to x rays or CT scout scans in particular when the cross sectional or volumetric data are acquired through neighboring joints. The accuracy of the position orientation shape or combinations thereof of a 3D guide template can thus be improved with resulting improvement in accuracy of the surgical correction of underlying deformities such as varus valgus abduction adduction or rotation deformities.

An imaging test obtained during weight bearing conditions has some inherent advantages in that it demonstrates normal as well as pathological loading and load distribution. A cross sectional imaging study such as a CT scan or MRI scan has some advantages because it allows one to visualize and demonstrate the anatomical landmarks in three rather than two dimensions thereby adding accuracy. Moreover measurements can be performed in other planes such as the sagittal or oblique planes that may not be easily accessible in certain anatomical regions using conventional radiography. In principle any imaging test can be utilized for this purpose.

The biomechanical axis can be defined as the axis going from the center of the femoral head between the condylar surfaces and through the ankle joint

The software may automatically semi automatically or manually assisted find or identify the relevant anatomic points to calculate the anatomic and biomechanical axes in accordance with various embodiments. For example the software or the user can find the center of the femoral head. Optionally this can be done in 3D rather than only in 2D. Thus for example in the femoral head the software can find the center of the femoral head relative to its x y and z dimensions. Alternatively the relevant anatomic points can be selected manually and the axes can be calculated.

In another embodiment the software can compute methods of adjusting varus or valgus or ante or retroversion deformity or rotational deformity based on such anatomic and biomechanical axis measurements. For example the surface of a surgical guide template can be adapted so that surgical cuts performed for a total knee implant can be placed to correct an underlying varus or valgus deformity or for example ante or retroversion. Alternatively the openings cut planes of a surgical guide template used for drilling cutting and the like can be adjusted to achieve a varus or valgus correction to a near anatomic or physiologic range. These adjustments can be optimized for the implants of different manufacturers e.g. Johnson Johnson Stryker Smith Nephew Biomet and Zimmer.

In various embodiments gait loading and other physical activities of a joint as well as static joint positions may be simulated using a computer workstation. The template and its apertures and the resultant surgical templates and or procedures e.g. cuts drilling rasping may be optimized using this information to achieve an optimal functional result. For example the template and its apertures and the resultant implant position may be optimized for different degrees of flexion and extension internal or external rotation abduction or adduction and ante or retroversion. Thus the templates may be used to achieve motion that is optimized in one two or more directions. Not only anatomic but also functional optimization is possible in this manner.

The origin and insertion of ligaments e.g. the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments and the medial and lateral collateral ligaments in the case of a knee can be visualized on the scan. With MRI the ligaments are directly visible. If the ligament is torn the location of the residual fibers at the origin or attachment can be visualized. Different joint positions can then be simulated and changes in ligament length can be determined for different angles of flexion and extension internal or external rotation abduction or adduction and ante or retroversion. These simulations can be performed without but also with the implant in place. Thus ligament length and through this presumed tension can be estimated virtually with any given implant and implant size. Different implants or component s can be tested preoperatively on the computer workstation and the implant or component s yielding the optimal ligament performance e.g. minimal change in ligament length for different joint positions can be determined pre operatively. Thus the various embodiments provide among others for pre operative ligament balancing including but not limited to by directly visualizing the ligaments or fiber remnants.

For example in one embodiment a loading apparatus may be applied to the patient to simulate weight bearing while acquiring the CT scan. A non limiting example of such a loading apparatus has been described by Dynamed with the Dynawell device. Any loading apparatus that can apply axial or other physiologic or near physiologic loading forces on the hip knee or ankle joints or two or three of them may be used. Other more sophisticated scanning procedures can be used to derive this information without departing from the scope of the invention.

In one embodiment when imaging a joint of the lower extremity a standing weight bearing x ray can be obtained to determine the biomechanical axis. In the case of a knee or hip joint for example a standing weight bearing x ray of the hip joint or the knee joint can be obtained. Alternatively standing weight bearing x rays can be obtained spanning the entire leg from the hip to the foot. The x ray can be obtained in the antero posterior or posterior anterior projection but also in a lateral projection or principally any other projection that is desired. The user can measure the biomechanical axis for example by finding the centroid of the femoral head and the centroid of the ankle joint and by connecting these. This measurement can be performed manually for example on a x ray film or electronically for example on a digitized or digital image including with software assistance. The axis measured on the standing weight bearing x ray can be cross referenced with another imaging modality such a CT or MRI scan. For example a biomechanical axis can be determined on a standing x ray of the leg. The result and data can be cross referenced for example by identifying corresponding bony anatomical landmarks to a CT scan or MRI scan. The result and information can then be utilized to determine the optimal shape of a 3 D guidance template. Specifically the orientation position or shape of the template can be influenced based on the measurement of the biomechanical axis. Moreover the position or shape of any blocks attached to said templates or linkages or the position or shape instruments attached to the mold block or linkages can be influenced by this measurement. Combining the standing weight bearing imaging modality with CT scanning or MRI scanning has the principle advantage that the joint is evaluated during physiological loading. CT or MRI alone typically do not afford assessment in loaded weight bearing condition.

As described above the biomechanical axis can be evaluated in different planes or in three dimensions. For example the actual biomechanical axis can be assessed in the AP plane and a desired biomechanical axis can be determined in this plane. In addition the actual biomechanical axis can be determined in the lateral plane for example in the lateral projection radiograph and the desired biomechanical axis can be determined in the lateral plane. By measuring the relevant biomechanical and anatomical axis in two or more planes the shape of a 3 D guidance template and or implant can be further refined and optimized with result in improvements in clinical and patient function.

The biomechanical or anatomical axis may also be measured using other approaches including a non weight bearing position. For example anatomical landmarks can be identified on a CT scout scan and cross referenced to a joint such as a knee joint or a hip joint for which surgery is contemplated. Thus for example the user can measure and determine the centroid of the ankle joint and the centroid of the hip joint for knee surgery using the CT scout scan.

In one embodiment the anatomical landmarks are determined using CT slices or MRI slices rather than a scout scan. A CT scout scan or MRI scout scan can have inherent limitations in spatial resolution. A CT scout scan is typically a single 2 D radiographic image of the extremity lacking 3 D anatomical information and lacking high spatial resolution. An MRI scout scan is typically composed of multiple 2 D MRI slices possibly acquired in one two or three planes. However the resolution of the MRI scout scan is typically also limited. By acquiring selective slices and even isotropic or near isotropic data sets through neighboring joints anatomical landmarks can be identified in a more reliable manner thereby improving the accuracy of anatomical and biomechanical axis determination. This improvement in accuracy translates into an improvement in accuracy in the resultant 3 D guidance mold for example a knee or hip joint including improved accuracy of its shape orientation or position.

The angles of the anatomical structures of the proximal and distal femur also show a certain variability level i.e. standard deviation comparable with the varus or valgus angle or the angle between the anatomical femoral axis and the biomechanical axis Mahaisavariya B Sitthiseripratip K Tongdee T Bohez E Sloten J V Oris P.

In one embodiment 2 D sagittal and coronal reconstructions of CT slice images are used to manually estimate the biomechanical axis. One skilled in the art can easily recognize many different ways to automate this process. For example a CT scan covering at least the hip knee and ankle region is acquired. This results in image slices axial which can be interpolated to generate the sagittal and coronal views.

Preprocessing filtering of the slice images can be used to improve the contrast of the bone regions so that they can be extracted accurately using simple thresholding or a more involved image segmentation tool like LiveWire or active contour models.

Identification of landmarks of interest like the centroid of the tibial shaft the ankle joint the intercondylar notch and the centroid of the femoral head can be performed. The biomechanical axis can be defined as the line connecting the proximal and the distal centroids i.e. the femoral head centroid the tibial or ankle joint centroid. The position of the intercondylar notch can be used for evaluation of possible deviations errors or deformations including varus and valgus deformity.

In one embodiment multiple imaging tests can be combined. For example the anatomical and biomechanical axes can be estimated using a weight bearing x ray of the extremity or portions of the extremity. The anatomical information derived in this fashion can then be combined with a CT or MRI scan of one or more joints such as a hip knee or ankle joint. Landmarks seen on radiography can then for example be cross referenced on the CT or MRI scan. Axis measurements performed on radiography can be subsequently applied to the CT or MRI scans or other imaging modalities. Similarly the information obtained from a CT scan can be compared with that obtained with an MRI or ultrasound scan. In one embodiment image fusion of different imaging modalities can be performed. For example if surgery is contemplated in a knee joint a full length weight bearing x ray of the lower extremity can be obtained. This can be supplemented by a spiral CT scan optionally with intra articular contrast of the knee joint providing high resolution three dimensional anatomical characterization of the knee anatomy even including the menisci and cartilage. This information along with the axis information provided by the radiograph can be utilized to select or derive therapies such as implants or surgical instruments.

In certain embodiments it may be desirable to characterize the shape and dimension of intra articular structures including subchondral bone or the cartilage. This may be done for example by using a CT scan or a spiral CT scan of one or more joints. The spiral CT scan can optionally be performed using intra articular contrast. Alternatively an MRI scan can be performed. If CT is utilized a full spiral scan or a few selected slices can be obtained through neighboring joints. Typically a full spiral scan providing full three dimensional characterization would be obtained in the joint for which therapy is contemplated. If implants or templates for surgical instruments are selected or shaped using this scan the subchondral bone shape can be accurately determined from the resultant image data. A standard cartilage thickness and similarly a standard cartilage loss can be assumed in certain regions of the articular surface. For example a standard thickness of 2 mm of the articular cartilage can be applied to the subchondral bone in the anterior third of the medial and lateral femoral condyles. Similarly a standard thickness of 2 mm of the articular cartilage can be applied to the subchondral bone in the posterior third of the medial and lateral femoral condyles. A standard thickness of 0 mm of the articular cartilage can be applied in the central weight bearing zone of the medial condyle and a different value can be applied to the lateral condyle. The transition between these zones can be gradual for example from 2 mm to 0 mm. These standard values of estimated cartilage thickness and cartilage loss in different regions of the joint can optionally be derived from a reference database. The reference database can include categories such as age body mass index BMI severity of disease pain severity of varus deformity severity of valgus deformity Kellgren Lawrence score along with other parameters that are determined to be relative and useful. Use of a standard thickness for the articular cartilage can facilitate the imaging protocols required for pre operative planning.

Alternatively however the articular cartilage can be fully characterized by performing a spiral CT scan of the joint in the presence of intra articular contrast or by performing an MRI scan using cartilage sensitive pulse sequences.

The techniques described herein can be used to obtain an image of a joint that is stationary either weight bearing or not or in motion or combinations thereof. Imaging studies that are obtained during joint motion can be useful for assessing the load bearing surface. This can be advantageous for designing or selecting implants e.g. for selecting reinforcements in high load areas for surgical tools and for implant placement e.g. for optimizing implant alignment relative to high load areas.

In accordance with another embodiment a method and system for determining joint space width is provided. Without limitation a CT scan MRI scan optical scan and or ultrasound imaging is performed. The medial and lateral joint space width in a knee joint the joint space in a hip joint ankle joint or other joint is evaluated. This evaluation may be performed in two dimensions using a single scan plane orientation such as sagittal or coronal plane or it may be performed in three dimensions. The evaluation of joint space width may include measuring the distance from the subchondral bone plate of one articular surface to the subchondral bone plate of the opposing articular surface. Alternatively the cartilage thickness may be measured directly on one or more articular surfaces. Joint space width or cartilage thickness may be measured for different regions of the joint and joint space width and cartilage loss can be evaluated in anterior posterior medial lateral superior and or inferior positions. The measurements may be performed for different positions of the joint such as a neutral position 45 degrees of flexion 90 degrees of flexion 5 degrees of abduction 5 degrees of internal rotation and so forth. For example in a knee joint the joint space width may be evaluated in extension and at 25 degrees of knee flexion and 90 degrees of knee flexion. The medial and lateral joint space width may be compared and differences in medial and lateral joint space width can be utilized to optimize the desired postoperative correction in anatomical or biomechanical axis alignment based on this information. The shape orientation or position of a 3D guided template may be adjusted using this information for example in knee or hip implant placement or other surgeries.

For example the measurement may show reduced joint space width or cartilage thickness in the medial compartment when compared to a normal anatomic reference standard e.g. from age or sex or gender matched controls and or lateral compartment. This can coincide with valgus alignment of the knee joint measured for example on the scout scan of an CT scan or the localizer scan of an MRI scan including multiple localizer scans through the hip knee and ankle joints.

If the biomechanical axis estimated on the comparison of the medial and lateral joint space width coincides with the biomechanical axis of the extremity measured on the scout scan no further adjustment may be necessary. If the biomechanical axis estimated on the comparison of the medial and lateral joint space width does not coincide with the biomechanical axis of the extremity measured on the CT or MRI scout scan additional correction of the valgus deformity or in other embodiments varus or other deformities can be achieved.

This additional correction may be determined for example by adding the difference in axis correction desired based on biomechanical axis measured by comparison of the medial lateral joint space width and axis correction desired based on measurement of the biomechanical axis of the extremity measured on the scout or localizer scan to axis correction desired based on measurement of the biomechanical axis of the extremity measured on the scout or localizer scan alone. By combining the information from both measurement of joint space width of the median and lateral compartment and measurement of the biomechanical axis using the scout scan or localizer scan or for example a weight bearing x ray an improved assessment of axis alignment during load bearing conditions can be obtained with resultant improvements in the shape orientation or position of the 3D guidance template and related attachments or linkages.

Optionally the extremity can be loaded while in the scanner for example using a compression harness. Examples for compression harnesses have been published for example by Dynawell.

In another embodiment an imaging modality such as spiral CT spiral CT arthography MRI optical imaging optical coherence tomography ultrasound and others may be used to estimate cartilage loss in one two or three dimensions. The information can be used to determine a desired correction of a measured biomechanical or anatomical axis. The correction can be in the anterior posterior medio lateral and or super inferior direction or any other direction applicable or desirable or combinations thereof. The information can be combined with other data e.g. from a standing weight bearing x ray or CT scout scan or an MRI localizer scan or a CT scan or MRI scan that includes axial spiral or other images through the hip knee and ankle joints. The information can be used to refine the axis correction desired based on for example standing x rays non weight bearing x rays CT scout scans MRI localizer scans and the like.

In another embodiment any axis correction can be performed in a single plane e.g. the medial lateral plane in two planes e.g. the medial lateral and anterior posterior planes or multiple planes including oblique planes that are biomechanically or anatomically relevant or desirable.

Additional improvements in accuracy of the 3D guide template and or implants surfaces may be obtained with use of imaging technology that yields high spatial resolution not only within the imaging plane but along all three planes specifically the X Y and Z axis. With CT scanning this can be achieved with the advent of spiral CT Scanning techniques. With MRI dual or more plane scanning or volumetric acquisition can be performed. If dual or more plane MRI scanning is performed these multiple scan planes can be fused for example by cross registration and resampling along the X Y and Z axis. The resultant effective resolution in X Y and Z direction is greatly improved as compared to standard CT scanning or standard MRI scanning. Improvements in resolution have the advantage that the resultant 3D guide templates can be substantially more accurate for example with regard to their position shape or orientation.

Imaging modalities are subject to scan to scan variations for example including spatial distortion. In one embodiment phantom scans may be performed in order to optimize the scan quality specifically spatial resolution and spatial distortion. A phantom scan can be performed prior to a patient scan simultaneously with a patient scan or after a patient scan. Using the phantom scan data it is possible to make adjustments and optimizations of the scanner and moreover to perform image post processing to perform corrections for example correction of geometric distortions. Thus if a phantom scan detects certain geometric distortion in the X Y or Z axis and the amount of distortion is measured on the phantom scan a correction factor can be included in the data prior to generating a 3D guide template. The resulting 3D guide template is thus more accurate with resulting improvement in intra operative cross reference to the anatomic surface and resultant improved accuracy in any surgical intervention such as drilling or cutting. In various embodiments the areas of distortion can be identified and or indicated on any relevant images including where such distortions have been corrected or otherwise altered from their original initial or raw data.

In another embodiment a smoothing operation e.g. using low frequency filtering can be performed in order to remove any image related artifacts such as stepping artifacts between adjacent CT or MRI slices. In some applications the smoothing operation can be helpful in improving the fit between the joint and the template. In various embodiments the areas of smoothing or other image alterations can be identified and or indicated on any relevant images including where such alterations have corrected or otherwise altered the image information from an original initial raw or preprocessed data state.

Alternatively or in addition to non invasive imaging techniques described above measurements of the size of an area of diseased cartilage or an area of cartilage loss measurements of cartilage thickness and or curvature of cartilage or bone can be obtained intraoperatively during arthroscopy or open arthrotomy. Intraoperative measurements can but need not involve actual contact with one or more areas of the articular surfaces.

Devices suitable for obtaining intraoperative measurements of cartilage or bone or other articular structures and to generate a topographical map of the surface include but are not limited to Placido disks optical measurements tools and device optical imaging tools and devices and laser interferometers and or deformable materials or devices. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 6 382 028 to Wooh et al. issued May 7 2002 U.S. Pat. No. 6 057 927 to Levesque et al. issued May 2 2000 U.S. Pat. No. 5 523 843 to Yamane et al. issued Jun. 4 1996 U.S. Pat. No. 5 847 804 to Sarver et al. issued Dec. 8 1998 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 684 562 to Fujieda issued Nov. 4 1997 .

In alternative embodiments an optical imaging device or measurement tool e.g. a laser interferometer can also be attached to the end of an endoscopic device. Optionally a small sensor can be attached to the device in order to determine the cartilage surface or bone curvature using phase shift interferometry producing a fringe pattern analysis phase map wave front visualization of the cartilage surface. The curvature can then be visualized on a monitor as a color coded topographical map of the cartilage surface. Additionally a mathematical model of the topographical map can be used to determine the ideal surface topography to replace any cartilage or bone defects in the area analyzed. This computed ideal surface or surfaces can then be visualized on the monitor and can be used to select the curvature or curvatures of the replacement cartilage or mold.

Optical imaging techniques can be utilized to generate a 3D visualization or surface map of the cartilage or bone which can be used to generate an articular repair system or a mold. One skilled in the art will readily recognize that other techniques for optical measurements of the cartilage surface curvature can be employed without departing from the scope of the invention. For example a 2 dimensional or 3 dimensional map can be generated.

Other devices to measure cartilage and subchondral bone intraoperatively include for example ultrasound probes. An ultrasound probe including a handheld probe can be applied to the cartilage and the curvature of the cartilage and or the subchondral bone can be measured. Moreover the size of a cartilage defect can be assessed and the thickness of the articular cartilage can be determined. Such ultrasound measurements can be obtained in A mode B mode or C mode. If A mode measurements are obtained an operator can typically repeat the measurements with several different probe orientations e.g. mediolateral and anteroposterior in order to derive a three dimensional assessment of size curvature and thickness.

One skilled in the art will easily recognize that different probe designs are possible using optical laser interferometry mechanical and ultrasound probes. The probes may be handheld. In certain embodiments the probes or at least a portion of the probe typically the portion that is in contact with the tissue can be sterile. Sterility can be achieved with use of sterile covers for example similar to those disclosed in WO 99 08598A1 to Lang published Feb. 25 1999.

Analysis on the curvature of the articular cartilage or subchondral bone using imaging tests and or intraoperative measurements can be used to determine the size of an area of diseased cartilage or cartilage loss. For example the curvature can change abruptly in areas of cartilage loss. Such abrupt or sudden changes in curvature can be used to detect the boundaries of diseased cartilage or cartilage defects.

As described above measurements can be made while the joint is stationary either weight bearing or not or in motion.

A wide variety of materials find use in the practice of the various embodiments disclosed and described herein including but not limited to plastics metals crystal free metals ceramics biological materials e.g. collagen or other extracellular matrix materials hydroxyapatite cells e.g. stem cells chondrocyte cells or the like or combinations thereof. Based on the information e.g. measurements obtained regarding the defect and the articular surface and or the subchondral bone a repair material can be formed or selected. Further using one or more of these techniques described herein a cartilage replacement or regenerating material having a curvature that will fit into a particular cartilage defect will follow the contour and shape of the articular surface and will match the thickness of the surrounding cartilage. The repair material can include any combination of materials and typically include at least one non pliable material for example materials that are not easily bent or changed.

Currently joint repair systems often employ metal and or polymeric materials including for example prostheses which are anchored into the underlying bone e.g. a femur in the case of a knee prosthesis . See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 203 576 to Afriat et al. issued Mar. 20 2001 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 322 588 to Ogle et al. issued Nov. 27 2001 and references cited therein. A wide variety of metals are useful in the practice of the various embodiments and can be selected based on any criteria. For example material selection can be based on resiliency to impart a desired degree of rigidity. Non limiting examples of suitable metals include silver gold platinum palladium iridium copper tin lead antimony bismuth zinc titanium cobalt stainless steel nickel iron alloys cobalt alloys such as Elgiloy a cobalt chromium nickel alloy and MP35N a nickel cobalt chromium molybdenum alloy and Nitinol a nickel titanium alloy aluminum manganese iron tantalum crystal free metals such as Liquidmetal alloys available from LiquidMetal Technologies www.liquidmetal.com other metals that can slowly form polyvalent metal ions for example to inhibit calcification of implanted substrates in contact with a patient s bodily fluids or tissues and combinations thereof.

Suitable synthetic polymers include without limitation polyamides e.g. nylon polyesters polystyrenes polyacrylates vinyl polymers e.g. polyethylene polytetrafluoroethylene polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride polycarbonates polyurethanes poly dimethyl siloxanes cellulose acetates polymethyl methacrylates polyether ether ketones ethylene vinyl acetates polysulfones nitrocelluloses similar copolymers and mixtures thereof. Bioresorbable synthetic polymers can also be used such as dextran hydroxyethyl starch derivatives of gelatin polyvinylpyrrolidone polyvinyl alcohol poly N 2 hydroxypropyl methacrylamide poly hydroxy acids poly epsilon caprolactone polylactic acid polyglycolic acid poly dimethyl glycolic acid poly hydroxy butyrate and similar copolymers can also be used.

Other materials would also be appropriate for example the polyketone known as polyetheretherketone PEEK . This includes the material PEEK 450G which is an unfilled PEEK approved for medical implantation available from Victrex of Lancashire Great Britain. Victrex is located at www.matweb.com or see Boedeker www.boedeker.com . Other sources of this material include Gharda located in Panoli India www.ghardapolymers.com .

It should be noted that the material selected can also be filled. For example other grades of PEEK are also available and contemplated such as 30 glass filled or 30 carbon filled provided such materials are cleared for use in implantable devices by the FDA or other regulatory body. Glass filled PEEK reduces the expansion rate and increases the flexural modulus of PEEK relative to that portion which is unfilled. The resulting product is known to be ideal for improved strength stiffness or stability. Carbon filled PEEK is known to enhance the compressive strength and stiffness of PEEK and lower its expansion rate. Carbon filled PEEK offers wear resistance and load carrying capability.

As will be appreciated other suitable similarly biocompatible thermoplastic or thermoplastic polycondensate materials that resist fatigue have good memory are flexible and or deflectable have very low moisture absorption and good wear and or abrasion resistance can be used without departing from the scope of the invention. The implant can also be comprised of polyetherketoneketone PEKK .

Other materials that can be used include polyetherketone PEK polyetherketoneetherketoneketone PEKEKK and polyetheretherketoneketone PEEKK and generally a polyaryletheretherketone. Further other polyketones can be used as well as other thermoplastics.

Reference to appropriate polymers that can be used for the implant can be made to the following documents all of which are incorporated herein by reference. These documents include PCT Publication WO 02 02158 A1 dated Jan. 10 2002 and entitled Bio Compatible Polymeric Materials PCT Publication WO 02 00275 A1 dated Jan. 3 2002 and entitled Bio Compatible Polymeric Materials and PCT Publication WO 02 00270 A1 dated Jan. 3 2002 and entitled Bio Compatible Polymeric Materials.

The polymers can be prepared by any of a variety of approaches including conventional polymer processing methods. Various approaches include for example injection molding which is suitable for the production of polymer components with significant structural features and rapid prototyping approaches such as reaction injection molding and stereolithography. The substrate can be textured or made porous by either physical abrasion or chemical alteration to facilitate incorporation of the metal coating. Other processes are also appropriate such as extrusion injection compression molding and or machining techniques. Typically the polymer is chosen for its physical and mechanical properties and is suitable for carrying and spreading the physical load between the joint surfaces.

More than one metal and or polymer can be used in combination with each other. For example one or more metal containing substrates can be coated with polymers in one or more regions or alternatively one or more polymer containing substrate can be coated in one or more regions with one or more metals.

The system or prosthesis can be porous or porous coated. The porous surface components can be made of various materials including metals ceramics and polymers. These surface components can in turn be secured by various means to a multitude of structural cores formed of various metals. Suitable porous coatings include but are not limited to metal ceramic polymeric e.g. biologically neutral elastomers such as silicone rubber polyethylene terephthalate and or combinations thereof or combinations thereof. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 3 605 123 to Hahn issued Sep. 20 1971. U.S. Pat. No. 3 808 606 to Tronzo issued May 7 1974 and U.S. Pat. No. 3 843 975 to Tronzo issued Oct. 29 1974 U.S. Pat. No. 3 314 420 to Smith issued Apr. 18 1967 U.S. Pat. No. 3 987 499 to Scharbach issued Oct. 26 1976 and German Offenlegungsschrift 2 306 552. There can be more than one coating layer and the layers can have the same or different porosities. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 3 938 198 to Kahn et al. issued Feb. 17 1976.

The coating can be applied by surrounding a core with powdered polymer and heating until cured to form a coating with an internal network of interconnected pores. The tortuosity of the pores e.g. a measure of length to diameter of the paths through the pores can be used in evaluating the probable success of such a coating in use on a prosthetic device. See also U.S. Pat. No. 4 213 816 to Morris issued Jul. 22 1980. The porous coating can be applied in the form of a powder and the article as a whole subjected to an elevated temperature that bonds the powder to the substrate. Selection of suitable polymers and or powder coatings can be determined in view of the teachings and references cited herein for example based on the melt index of each.

Repair materials can also include one or more biological material either alone or in combination with non biological materials. For example any base material can be designed or shaped and suitable cartilage replacement or regenerating material s such as fetal cartilage cells can be applied to be the base. The cells can be then be grown in conjunction with the base until the thickness and or curvature of the cartilage surrounding the cartilage defect has been reached. Conditions for growing cells e.g. chondrocytes on various substrates in culture ex vivo and in vivo are described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 478 739 to Slivka et al. issued Dec. 26 1995 U.S. Pat. No. 5 842 477 to Naughton et al. issued Dec. 1 1998 U.S. Pat. No. 6 283 980 to Vibe Hansen et al. issued Sep. 4 2001 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 365 405 to Salzmann et al. issued Apr. 2 2002. Non limiting examples of suitable substrates include plastic tissue scaffold a bone replacement material e.g. a hydroxyapatite a bioresorbable material or any other material suitable for growing a cartilage replacement or regenerating material on it.

Biological polymers can be naturally occurring or produced in vitro by fermentation and the like. Suitable biological polymers include without limitation collagen elastin silk keratin gelatin polyamino acids cat gut sutures polysaccharides e.g. cellulose and starch and mixtures thereof. Biological polymers can be bioresorbable.

Biological materials used in the methods described herein can be autografts from the same subject allografts from another individual of the same species and or xenografts from another species . See also International Patent Publications WO 02 22014 to Alexander et al. published Mar. 21 2002 and WO 97 27885 to Lee published Aug. 7 1997. In certain embodiments autologous materials may be used as they can carry a reduced risk of immunological complications to the host including re absorption of the materials inflammation and or scarring of the tissues surrounding the implant site.

In certain embodiments the cartilage replacement material has a particular biochemical composition. For instance the biochemical composition of the cartilage surrounding a defect can be assessed by taking tissue samples and chemical analysis or by imaging techniques. For example WO 02 22014 to Alexander describes the use of gadolinium for imaging of articular cartilage to monitor glycosaminoglycan content within the cartilage. The cartilage replacement or regenerating material can then be made or cultured in a manner to achieve a biochemical composition similar to that of the cartilage surrounding the implantation site. The culture conditions used to achieve the desired biochemical compositions can include for example varying concentrations. Biochemical composition of the cartilage replacement or regenerating material can for example be influenced by controlling concentrations and exposure times of certain nutrients and growth factors.

In various embodiments a container or well can be formed to the selected specifications for example to match the material needed for a particular subject or to create a stock of repair materials in a variety of sizes. The size and shape of the container can be designed using the thickness and curvature information obtained from the joint and from the cartilage defect. More specifically the inside of the container can be shaped to follow any selected measurements for example as obtained from the cartilage defect s of a particular subject. The container can be filled with a cartilage replacement or regenerating material for example collagen containing materials plastics bioresorbable materials and or any suitable tissue scaffold. The cartilage regenerating or replacement material can also consist of a suspension of stem cells or fetal or immature or mature cartilage cells that subsequently develop to more mature cartilage inside the container. Further development and or differentiation can be enhanced with use of certain tissue nutrients and growth factors.

The material is allowed to harden and or grow inside the container until the material has the desired traits for example thickness elasticity hardness biochemical composition etc. Molds can be generated using any suitable technique for example computer devices and automation e.g. computer assisted design CAD and for example computer assisted modeling CAM . Because the resulting material generally follows the contour of the inside of the container it will better fit the defect itself and facilitate integration.

Using information on thickness and curvature of the cartilage a physical model of the surfaces of the articular cartilage and of the underlying bone can be created. This physical model can be representative of a limited area within the joint or it can encompass the entire joint. For example in the knee joint the physical model can encompass only the medial or lateral femoral condyle both femoral condyles and the notch region the medial tibial plateau the lateral tibial plateau the entire tibial plateau the medial patella the lateral patella the entire patella or the entire joint. The location of a diseased area of cartilage can be determined for example using a 3D coordinate system or a 3D Euclidian distance as described in WO 02 22014.

In this way the size of the defect to be repaired can be determined. As will be apparent some but not all defects will include less than the entire cartilage. Thus in one embodiment the thickness of the normal or only mildly diseased cartilage surrounding one or more cartilage defects is measured. This thickness measurement can be obtained at a single point or at multiple points for example 2 point 4 6 points 7 10 points more than 10 points or over the length of the entire remaining cartilage. Furthermore once the size of the defect is determined an appropriate therapy e.g. articular repair system can be selected such that as much as possible of the healthy surrounding tissue is preserved.

In other embodiments the curvature of the articular surface can be measured to design and or shape the repair material. Further both the thickness of the remaining cartilage and the curvature of the articular surface can be measured to design and or shape the repair material. Alternatively the curvature of the subchondral bone can be measured and the resultant measurement s can be used to either select or shape a cartilage replacement material. For example the contour of the subchondral bone can be used to re create a virtual cartilage surface the margins of an area of diseased cartilage can be identified. The subchondral bone shape in the diseased areas can be measured. A virtual contour can then be created by copying the subchondral bone surface into the cartilage surface whereby the copy of the subchondral bone surface connects the margins of the area of diseased cartilage.

Turning now to various stages of knee resurfacing steps are shown. illustrates an example of normal thickness cartilage in the anterior central and posterior portion of a femoral condyle with a cartilage defect in the posterior portion of the femoral condyle. shows the detection of a sudden change in thickness indicating the margins of a cartilage defect that would be observed using the imaging techniques or the mechanical optical laser or ultrasound techniques described above. shows the margins of a weight bearing surface mapped onto the articular cartilage . Cartilage defect is located within the weight bearing surface .

By providing a softer first component and a firmer second component the overall implant can be configured so that its relative hardness is analogous to that of the bone cartilage or bone meniscus area that it abuts. Thus the softer material first component being formed of a softer material could perform the cushioning function of the nearby meniscus or cartilage.

Now turning to these figures depict exemplary knee imaging and resurfacing processes. depicts a magnified view of an area of diseased cartilage demonstrating decreased cartilage thickness when compared to the surrounding normal cartilage . The margins of the defect have been determined. depicts the measurement of cartilage thickness adjacent to the defect . depicts the placement of a multi component mini prosthesis for articular resurfacing. The thickness of the first component closely approximates that of the adjacent normal cartilage . The thickness can vary in different regions of the prosthesis. The curvature of the distal portion of the first component closely approximates an extension of the normal cartilage surrounding the defect. The curvature of the distal portion of the second component is a projection of the surface of the adjacent subchondral bone and can have a curvature that is the same or substantially similar to all or part of the surrounding subchondral bone.

Examples of one component systems include but are not limited to a plastic a polymer a metal a metal alloy crystal free metals a biologic material or combinations thereof. In certain embodiments the surface of the repair system facing the underlying bone can be smooth. In other embodiments the surface of the repair system facing the underlying bone can be porous or porous coated. In another aspect the surface of the repair system facing the underlying bone is designed with one or more grooves for example to facilitate the in growth of the surrounding tissue. The external surface of the device can have a step like design which can be advantageous for altering biomechanical stresses. Optionally flanges can also be added at one or more positions on the device e.g. to prevent the repair system from rotating to control toggle and or prevent settling into the marrow cavity . The flanges can be part of a conical or a cylindrical design. A portion or all of the repair system facing the underlying bone can also be flat which can help to control depth of the implant and to prevent toggle.

Non limiting examples of multiple component systems include combinations of metal plastic metal alloys crystal free metals and one or more biological materials. One or more components of the articular surface repair system can be composed of a biologic material e.g. a tissue scaffold with cells such as cartilage cells or stem cells alone or seeded within a substrate such as a bioresorable material or a tissue scaffold allograft autograft or combinations thereof and or a non biological material e.g. polyethylene or a chromium alloy such as chromium cobalt .

Thus the repair system can include one or more areas of a single material or a combination of materials for example the articular surface repair system can have a first and a second component. The first component is typically designed to have size thickness and curvature similar to that of the cartilage tissue lost while the second component is typically designed to have a curvature similar to the subchondral bone. In addition the first component can have biomechanical properties similar to articular cartilage including but not limited to similar elasticity and resistance to axial loading or shear forces. The first and the second component can consist of two different metals or metal alloys. One or more components of the system e.g. the second portion can be composed of a biologic material including but not limited to bone or a non biologic material including but not limited to hydroxyapatite tantalum a chromium alloy chromium cobalt or other metal alloys.

One or more regions of the articular surface repair system e.g. the outer margin of the first portion and or the second portion can be bioresorbable for example to allow the interface between the articular surface repair system and the patient s normal cartilage over time to be filled in with hyaline or fibrocartilage. Similarly one or more regions e.g. the outer margin of the first portion of the articular surface repair system and or the second portion can be porous. The degree of porosity can change throughout the porous region linearly or non linearly for where the degree of porosity will typically decrease towards the center of the articular surface repair system. The pores can be designed for in growth of cartilage cells cartilage matrix and connective tissue thereby achieving a smooth interface between the articular surface repair system and the surrounding cartilage.

The repair system e.g. the second component in multiple component systems can be attached to the patient s bone with use of a cement like material such as methylmethacrylate injectable hydroxy or calcium apatite materials and the like.

In certain embodiments one or more portions of the articular surface repair system can be pliable or liquid or deformable at the time of implantation and can harden later. Hardening can occur for example within 1 second to 2 hours or any time period therebetween within 1 second to 30 minutes or any time period therebetween or between 1 second and 10 minutes or any time period therebetween .

One or more components of the articular surface repair system can be adapted to receive injections. For example the external surface of the articular surface repair system can have one or more openings therein. The openings can be sized to receive screws tubing needles or other devices which can be inserted and advanced to the desired depth for example through the articular surface repair system into the marrow space. Injectables such as methylmethacrylate and injectable hydroxy or calcium apatite materials can then be introduced through the opening or tubing inserted therethrough into the marrow space thereby bonding the articular surface repair system with the marrow space. Similarly screws or pins or other anchoring mechanisms. can be inserted into the openings and advanced to the underlying subchondral bone and the bone marrow or epiphysis to achieve fixation of the articular surface repair system to the bone. Portions or all components of the screw or pin can be bioresorbable for example the distal portion of a screw that protrudes into the marrow space can be bioresorbable. During the initial period after the surgery the screw can provide the primary fixation of the articular surface repair system. Subsequently ingrowth of bone into a porous coated area along the undersurface of the articular cartilage repair system can take over as the primary stabilizer of the articular surface repair system against the bone.

The articular surface repair system can be anchored to the patient s bone with use of a pin or screw or other attachment mechanism. The attachment mechanism can be bioresorbable. The screw or pin or attachment mechanism can be inserted and advanced towards the articular surface repair system from a non cartilage covered portion of the bone or from a non weight bearing surface of the joint.

The interface between the articular surface repair system and the surrounding normal cartilage can be at an angle for example oriented at an angle of 90 degrees relative to the underlying subchondral bone. Suitable angles can be determined in view of the teachings herein and in certain cases non 90 degree angles can have advantages with regard to load distribution along the interface between the articular surface repair system and the surrounding normal cartilage.

The interface between the articular surface repair system and the surrounding normal cartilage and or bone can be covered with a pharmaceutical or bioactive agent for example a material that stimulates the biological integration of the repair system into the normal cartilage and or bone. The surface area of the interface can be irregular for example to increase exposure of the interface to pharmaceutical or bioactive agents.

As described herein repair systems including surgical instruments templates guides and or molds of various sizes curvatures and thicknesses can be obtained. These repair systems including surgical instruments guides templates and or molds can be catalogued and stored to create a library of systems from which an appropriate system for an individual patient can then be selected. In other words a defect or an articular surface is assessed in a particular subject and a pre existing repair system including surgical instruments templates guides and or molds having a suitable shape and size is selected from the library for further manipulation e.g. shaping and implantation.

As noted above the methods and compositions described herein can be used to replace only a portion of the articular surface for example an area of diseased cartilage or lost cartilage on the articular surface. In these systems the articular surface repair system can be designed to replace only the area of diseased or lost cartilage or it can extend beyond the area of diseased or lost cartilage e.g. 3 or 5 mm into normal adjacent cartilage. In certain embodiments the prosthesis replaces less than about 70 to 80 or any value therebetween of the articular surface e.g. any given articular surface such as a single femoral condyle etc. less than about 50 to 70 or any value therebetween less than about 30 to 50 or any value therebetween less than about 20 to 30 or any value therebetween or less than about 20 of the articular surface.

The prosthesis can include multiple components for example a component that is implanted into the bone e.g. a metallic device attached to a component that is shaped to cover the defect of the cartilage overlaying the bone. Additional components for example intermediate plates meniscal repair systems and the like can also be included. It is contemplated that each component replaces less than all of the corresponding articular surface. However each component need not replace the same portion of the articular surface. In other words the prosthesis can have a bone implanted component that replaces less than 30 of the bone and a cartilage component that replaces 60 of the cartilage. The prosthesis can include any combination provided each component replaces less than the entire articular surface.

The articular surface repair system can be formed or selected so that it will achieve a near anatomic fit or match with the surrounding or adjacent cartilage. Typically the articular surface repair system is formed and or selected so that its outer margin located at the external surface will be aligned with the surrounding or adjacent cartilage.

Thus the articular repair system can be designed to replace the weight bearing portion or more or less than the weight bearing portion of an articular surface for example in a femoral condyle. The weight bearing surface refers to the contact area between two opposing articular surfaces during activities of normal daily living e.g. normal gait . At least one or more weight bearing portions can be replaced in this manner e.g. on a femoral condyle and on a tibia.

In other embodiments an area of diseased cartilage or cartilage loss can be identified in a weight bearing area and only a portion of the weight bearing area specifically the portion containing the diseased cartilage or area of cartilage loss can be replaced with an articular surface repair system.

In another embodiment the articular repair system can be designed or selected to replace substantially all of the articular surface e.g. a condyle.

In another embodiment for example in patients with diffuse cartilage loss the articular repair system can be designed to replace an area slightly larger than the weight bearing surface.

In certain aspects the defect to be repaired is located only on one articular surface typically the most diseased surface. For example in a patient with severe cartilage loss in the medial femoral condyle but less severe disease in the tibia the articular surface repair system can only be applied to the medial femoral condyle. In the various methods described herein the articular surface repair system can be designed to achieve an exact or a near anatomic fit with the adjacent normal cartilage.

In other embodiments more than one articular surface can be repaired. The area s of repair will be typically limited to areas of diseased cartilage or cartilage loss or areas slightly greater than the area of diseased cartilage or cartilage loss within the weight bearing surface s .

The implant and or the implant site can be sculpted to achieve a near anatomic alignment between the implant and the implant site. In another embodiment an electronic image is used to measure the thickness curvature or shape of the articular cartilage or the subchondral bone and or the size of a defect and an articular surface repair system is selected using this information. The articular surface repair system can be inserted arthroscopically. The articular surface repair system can have a single radius. More typically however as shown in discussed above the articular surface repair system has varying curvatures and radii within the same plane e.g. anteroposterior or mediolateral or superoinferior or oblique planes or within multiple planes. In this manner the articular surface repair system can be shaped to achieve a near anatomic alignment between the implant and the implant site. This design allows not only allows for different degrees of convexity or concavity but also for concave portions within a predominantly convex shape or vice versa .

In another embodiment the articular surface repair system has an anchoring stem used to anchor the device for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 224 632 to Pappas et al issued May 1 2001. The stem or peg can have different shapes including conical rectangular fin among others. The mating bone cavity is typically similarly shaped as the corresponding stem.

As shown in discussed above the articular surface repair system can be affixed to the subchondral bone with one or more stems or pegs extending through the subchondral plate into the marrow space. In certain instances this design can reduce the likelihood that the implant will settle deeper into the joint over time by resting portions of the implant against the subchondral bone. The stems or pegs can be of any shape suitable to perform the function of anchoring the device to the bone. For example the pegs can be cylindrical or conical. Optionally the stems or pegs can further include notches or openings to allow bone in growth. In addition the stems can be porous coated for bone in growth. The anchoring stems or pegs can be affixed to the bone using bone cement. An additional anchoring device can also be affixed to the stem or peg. The anchoring device can have an umbrella shape e.g. radially expanding elements with the wider portion pointing towards the subchondral bone and away from the peg. The anchoring device can be advantageous for providing immediate fixation of the implant. The undersurface of the articular repair system facing the subchondral bone can be textured or rough thereby increasing the contact surface between the articular repair system and the subchondral bone. Alternatively the undersurface of the articular repair system can be porous coated thereby allowing in growth. The surgeon can support the in growth of bone by treating the subchondral bone with a rasp typically to create a larger surface area and or until bleeding from the subchondral bone occurs.

In another embodiment the articular surface repair system can be attached to the underlying bone or bone marrow using bone cement. Bone cement is typically made from an acrylic polymeric material. Typically the bone cement is comprised of two components a dry powder component and a liquid component which are subsequently mixed together. The dry component generally includes an acrylic polymer such as polymethylmethacrylate PMMA . The dry component can also contain a polymerization initiator such as benzoylperoxide which initiates the free radical polymerization process that occurs when the bone cement is formed. The liquid component on the other hand generally contains a liquid monomer such as methyl methacrylate MMA . The liquid component can also contain an accelerator such as an amine e.g. N N dimethyl p toluidine . A stabilizer such as hydroquinone can also be added to the liquid component to prevent premature polymerization of the liquid monomer. When the liquid component is mixed with the dry component the dry component begins to dissolve or swell in the liquid monomer. The amine accelerator reacts with the initiator to form free radicals that begin to link monomer units to form polymer chains. In the next two to four minutes the polymerization process proceeds changing the viscosity of the mixture from a syrup like consistency low viscosity into a dough like consistency high viscosity . Ultimately further polymerization and curing occur causing the cement to harden and affix a prosthesis to a bone.

In certain aspects of the embodiments disclosed herein bone cement or another liquid attachment material such as injectable calciumhydroxyapatite can be injected into the marrow cavity through one or more openings in the prosthesis. These openings in the prosthesis could extend from the articular surface to the undersurface of the prosthesis. After injection the openings could be closed with a polymer silicon metal metal alloy or bioresorbable plug.

In another embodiment one or more components of the articular surface repair e.g. the surface of the system that is pointing towards the underlying bone or bone marrow can be porous or porous coated. A variety of different porous metal coatings have been proposed for enhancing fixation of a metallic prosthesis by bone tissue in growth. Thus for example U.S. Pat. No. 3 855 638 to Pilliar issued Dec. 24 2974 discloses a surgical prosthetic device which can be used as a bone prosthesis comprising a composite structure consisting of a solid metallic material substrate and a porous coating of the same solid metallic material adhered to and extending over at least a portion of the surface of the substrate. The porous coating consists of a plurality of small discrete particles of metallic material bonded together at their points of contact with each other to define a plurality of connected interstitial pores in the coating. The size and spacing of the particles which can be distributed in a plurality of monolayers can be such that the average interstitial pore size is not more than about 200 microns. Additionally the pore size distribution can be substantially uniform from the substrate coating interface to the surface of the coating. In another embodiment the articular surface repair system can contain one or more polymeric materials that can be loaded with and release therapeutic agents including drugs or other pharmacological treatments that can be used for drug delivery. The polymeric materials can for example be placed inside areas of porous coating. The polymeric materials can be used to release therapeutic drugs e.g. bone or cartilage growth stimulating drugs. This embodiment can be combined with other embodiments wherein portions of the articular surface repair system can be bioresorbable. For example the first layer of an articular surface repair system or portions of its first layer can be bioresorbable. As the first layer gets increasingly resorbed local release of a cartilage growth stimulating drug can facilitate in growth of cartilage cells and matrix formation.

In any of the methods or compositions described herein the articular surface repair system can be pre manufactured with a range of sizes curvatures and thicknesses. Alternatively the articular surface repair system can be custom made for an individual patient. In addition the repair system can incorporate various anatomical relief features as described below to accommodate various anatomical features of the patient.

In certain instances shaping of the repair material will be required before or after formation e.g. growth to desired thickness or after selection of a pre manufactured implant and or blank for example where the thickness of the required cartilage material is not uniform e.g. where different sections of the cartilage replacement or regenerating material require different thicknesses . Shaping can include the removal of material as well as the addition of material as well as combinations thereof for differing areas of a single implant.

The replacement material can be shaped by any suitable technique including but not limited to mechanical abrasion laser abrasion or ablation radiofrequency treatment cryoablation metal additive technologies variations in exposure time and concentration of nutrients enzymes or growth factors and any other means suitable for influencing or changing cartilage thickness. See e.g. WO 00 15153 to Mansmann published Mar. 23 2000 If enzymatic digestion is used certain sections of the cartilage replacement or regenerating material can be exposed to higher doses of the enzyme or can be exposed longer as a means of achieving different thicknesses and curvatures of the cartilage replacement or regenerating material in different sections of said material.

The material can be shaped manually and or automatically for example using a device into which a pre selected thickness and or curvature has been input and then programming the device using the input information to achieve the desired shape.

In addition to or instead of shaping the cartilage repair material the site of implantation e.g. bone surface any cartilage material remaining etc. can also be shaped by any suitable technique in order to enhance integration of the repair material.

The articular repair system can be formed or selected so that it will achieve a near anatomic fit or match with the surrounding or adjacent cartilage or subchondral bone or menisci and other tissue. The shape of the repair system can be based on the analysis of an electronic image e.g. MRI CT digital tomosynthesis optical coherence tomography or the like . If the articular repair system is intended to replace an area of diseased cartilage or lost cartilage the near anatomic fit can be achieved using a method that provides a virtual reconstruction of the shape of healthy cartilage in an electronic image.

In one embodiment a near normal cartilage surface at the position of the cartilage defect can be reconstructed by interpolating the healthy cartilage surface across the cartilage defect or area of diseased cartilage. This can for example be achieved by describing the healthy cartilage by means of a parametric surface e.g. a B spline surface for which the control points are placed such that the parametric surface follows the contour of the healthy cartilage and bridges the cartilage defect or area of diseased cartilage. The continuity properties of the parametric surface will provide a smooth integration of the part that bridges the cartilage defect or area of diseased cartilage with the contour of the surrounding healthy cartilage. The part of the parametric surface over the area of the cartilage defect or area of diseased cartilage can be used to determine the shape or part of the shape of the articular repair system to match with the surrounding cartilage.

In another embodiment a near normal cartilage surface at the position of the cartilage defect or area of diseased cartilage can be reconstructed using morphological image processing. In a first step the cartilage can be extracted from the electronic image using manual semi automated and or automated segmentation techniques e.g. manual tracing region growing live wire model based segmentation resulting in a binary image. Defects in the cartilage appear as indentations that can be filled with a morphological closing operation performed in 2 D or 3 D with an appropriately selected structuring element. The closing operation is typically defined as a dilation followed by an erosion. A dilation operator sets the current pixel in the output image to 1 if at least one pixel of the structuring element lies inside a region in the source image. An erosion operator sets the current pixel in the output image to 1 if the whole structuring element lies inside a region in the source image. The filling of the cartilage defect or area of diseased cartilage creates a new surface over the area of the cartilage defect or area of diseased cartilage that can be used to determine the shape or part of the shape of the articular repair system to match with the surrounding cartilage or subchondral bone.

As described above the articular repair system including surgical tools and instruments molds in situ repair systems etc. can be formed or selected from a library or database of systems of various sizes curvatures and thicknesses so that it will achieve a near anatomic fit or match with the surrounding or adjacent cartilage and or subchondral bone. These systems can be pre made or made to order for an individual patient. In order to control the fit or match of the articular repair system with the surrounding or adjacent cartilage or subchondral bone or menisci and other tissues preoperatively a software program can be used that projects the articular repair system over the anatomic position where it will be implanted. Suitable software is commercially available and or readily modified or designed by a skilled programmer.

In yet another embodiment the articular repair system including unicompartmental and total knee implants as well as hip devices can be projected over the implantation site using one or more 2 D or 3 D images. The cartilage and or subchondral bone and other anatomic structures can be optionally extracted from a 2 D or 3 D electronic image such as an MRI or a CT using manual semi automated and or automated segmentation techniques. A 2 D or 3 D representation of the cartilage and or bone and other anatomic structures as well as the articular repair system can be generated for example using a polygon or NURBS surface or other parametric surface representation. Ligaments menisci and other articular structures can be displayed in 2 D and 3 D. For a description of various parametric surface representations see for example Foley J. D. et al. Computer Graphics Principles and Practice in C Addison Wesley 2edition 1995 .

The 2 D or 3 D representations of the cartilage and or subchondral bone and other anatomic structures and the articular repair system can be merged into a common coordinate system. The articular repair system including surgical tools and instruments molds in situ repair systems etc. can then be placed at the desired implantation site. The representations of the cartilage subchondral bone ligaments menisci and other anatomic structures and the articular repair system are rendered into a 2 D or 3 D image for example application programming interfaces APIs OpenGL standard library of advanced 3 D graphics functions developed by SGI Inc. available as part of the drivers for PC based video cards for example from www.nvidia.com for NVIDIA video cards or www.3dlabs.com for 3Dlabs products or as part of the system software for Unix workstations or DirectX multimedia API for Microsoft Windows based PC systems available from www.microsoft.com . The 2 D or 3 D image can be rendered or displayed showing the cartilage subchondral bone ligaments menisci or other anatomic objects and the articular repair system from varying angles e.g. by rotating or moving them interactively or non interactively in real time or non real time.

In another embodiment the implantation site may be visualized using one or more cross sectional 2 D images as described in U.S. Ser. No. 10 305 652 entitled Methods and Compositions for Articular Repair filed Nov. 27 2002 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Typically a series of 2 D cross sectional images will be used. The 2 D images can be generated with imaging tests such as CT MRI digital tomosynthesis ultrasound optical imaging optical coherence tomography other imaging modalities using methods and tools known to those of skill in the art. The articular repair system or implant can then be superimposed onto one or more of these 2 D images. The 2 D cross sectional images may be reconstructed in other planes e.g. from sagittal to coronal etc. Isotropic data sets e.g. data sets where the slice thickness is the same or nearly the same as the in plane resolution or near isotropic data sets can also be used. Multiple planes may be displayed simultaneously for example using a split screen display. The operator may also scroll through the 2 D images in any desired orientation in real time or near real time the operator can rotate the imaged tissue volume while doing this. The articular repair system or implant may be displayed in cross section utilizing different display planes e.g. sagittal coronal or axial typically matching those of the 2 D images demonstrating the cartilage subchondral bone ligaments menisci or other tissue. Alternatively a three dimensional display may be used for the articular repair system. The 2 D electronic image and the 2 D or 3 D representation of the articular repair system or implant may be merged into a common coordinate system. The cartilage repair system or implant can then be placed at the desired implantation site. The series of 2 D cross sections of the anatomic structures the implantation site and the articular repair system or implant may be displayed interactively e.g. the operator can scroll through a series of slices or non interactively e.g. as an animation that moves through the series of slices in real time or non real time.

The software can be designed so that the articular repair system including surgical tools and instruments molds in situ repair systems etc. with the best fit relative to the cartilage and or subchondral bone is automatically selected for example using one or more of the techniques described above. Alternatively the operator can select an articular repair system including surgical tools and instruments molds in situ repair systems etc. and project it or drag it onto the implantation site displayed on the cross sectional 2 D or the 3 D images. The operator can then move and rotate the articular repair system relative to the implantation site and scroll through a cross sectional 2 D or 3 D display of the articular repair system and of the anatomic structures. The operator can perform a visual and or computer assisted inspection of the fit between the articular repair system and the implantation site. This can be performed for different positions of the joint e.g. extension 45 90 degrees of flexion adduction abduction internal or external rotation. The procedure can be repeated until a satisfactory fit has been achieved. The procedure can be entirely manual by the operator it can however also be computer assisted. For example the software can select a first trial implant that the operator can test e.g. evaluate the fit . Software that highlights areas of poor alignment between the implant and the surrounding cartilage or subchondral bone or menisci or other tissues can also be designed and used. Based on this information the software or the operator can select another implant and test its alignment.

In all of the above embodiments the biomechanical axis and relevant anatomical axes or planes can be displayed simultaneous with the joint and or articular repair device in the 2 D or 3 D display. Simultaneous display of at least one or more biomechanical axes or anatomical axes or planes can help improve the assessment of fit of the articular repair system. Biomechanical axis or relevant anatomical axes or planes can also be displayed for different positions of the joint.

Rapid prototyping is a technique for fabricating a three dimensional object from a computer model of the object. A special printer is used to fabricate the prototype from a plurality of two dimensional layers. Computer software sections the representations of the object into a plurality of distinct two dimensional layers and then a three dimensional printer fabricates a layer of material for each layer sectioned by the software. Together the various fabricated layers form the desired prototype. More information about rapid prototyping techniques is available in US Patent Publication No 2002 0079601A1 to Russell et al. published Jun. 27 2002. An advantage to using rapid prototyping is that it enables the use of free form fabrication techniques that use toxic or potent compounds safely. These compounds can be safely incorporated in an excipient envelope which reduces worker exposure

A powder piston and build bed can be provided. Powder includes any material metal plastic etc. that can be made into a powder or bonded with a liquid. The power is rolled from a feeder source with a spreader onto a surface of a bed. The thickness of the layer is controlled by the computer. The print head then deposits a binder fluid onto the powder layer at a location where it is desired that the powder bind. Powder is again rolled into the build bed and the process is repeated with the binding fluid deposition being controlled at each layer to correspond to the three dimensional location of the device formation. For a further discussion of this process see for example US Patent Publication No 2003 017365A1 to Monkhouse et al. published Sep. 18 2003.

The rapid prototyping can use the two dimensional images obtained to determine each of the two dimensional shapes for each of the layers of the prototyping machine. In this scenario each two dimensional image slice would correspond to a two dimensional prototype slide. Alternatively the three dimensional shape of the defect can be determined as described above and then broken down into two dimensional slices for the rapid prototyping process. The advantage of using the three dimensional model is that the two dimensional slices used for the rapid prototyping machine can be along the same plane as the two dimensional images taken or along a different plane altogether.

Rapid prototyping can be combined or used in conjunction with casting techniques. For example a shell or container with inner dimensions corresponding to an articular repair system including surgical instruments molds alignment guides or surgical guides can be made using rapid prototyping. Plastic or wax like materials are typically used for this purpose. The inside of the container can subsequently be coated for example with a ceramic for subsequent casting. Using this process personalized casts can be generated.

Rapid prototyping can be used for producing articular repair systems including surgical tools molds alignment guides cut guides etc. Rapid prototyping can be performed at a manufacturing facility. Alternatively it may be performed in the operating room after an intraoperative measurement has been performed.

Alternatively milling techniques can be utilized for producing articular repair systems including surgical tools molds alignment guides cut guides etc.

Alternatively laser based techniques can be utilized for producing articular repair systems including surgical tools molds alignment guides cut guides etc.

Following one or more manipulations e.g. shaping growth development etc the cartilage replacement or regenerating material can then be implanted into the area of the defect. Implantation can be performed with the cartilage replacement or regenerating material still attached to the base material or removed from the base material. Any suitable methods and devices can be used for implantation for example devices as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 375 658 to Hangody et al. issued Apr. 23 2002 U.S. Pat. No. 6 358 253 to Torrie et al. issued Mar. 19 2002 U.S. Pat. No. 6 328 765 to Hardwick et al. issued Dec. 11 2001 and International Publication WO 01 19254 to Cummings et al. published Mar. 22 2001.

In selected cartilage defects the implantation site can be prepared with a single cut across the articular surface for example as shown in . In this case single and multi component prostheses can be utilized.

Performing a total knee arthroplasty is a complicated procedure. In replacing the knee with an artificial knee it is often desirable to get the anatomical and mechanical axes of the lower extremity aligned correctly to ensure optimal functioning of the implanted knee.

As shown in the center of the hip located at the head of the femur the center of the knee located at the notch where the intercondylar tubercle of the tibia meet the femur and ankle lie approximately in a straight line which defines the mechanical axis of the lower extremity. The anatomic axis aligns 5 7 offset from the mechanical axis in the valgus or outward direction.

The long axis of the tibia is collinear with the mechanical axis of the lower extremity . From a three dimensional perspective the lower extremity of the body ideally functions within a single plane known as the median anterior posterior plane MAP plane throughout the flexion extension arc. In order to accomplish this the femoral head the mechanical axis of the femur the patellar groove the intercondylar notch the patellar articular crest the tibia and the ankle remain within the MAP plane during the flexion extension movement. During movement the tibia rotates as the knee flexes and extends in the epicondylar axis which is perpendicular to the MAP plane.

A variety of image slices can be taken at each individual joint e.g. the knee joint and the hip joint . These image slices can be used as described above in Section I along with an image of the full leg to ascertain the axis.

With disease and malfunction of the knee alignment of the anatomic axis is altered. Performing a total knee arthroplasty is one solution for correcting a diseased knee. Implanting a total knee joint such as the PFC Sigma RP Knee System by Johnson Johnson requires that a series of resections be made to the surfaces forming the knee joint in order to facilitate installation of the artificial knee. The resections should be made to enable the installed artificial knee to achieve flexion extension movement within the MAP plane and to optimize the patient s anatomical and mechanical axis of the lower extremity.

First the tibia is resected to create a flat surface to accept the tibial component of the implant. In most cases the tibial surface is resected perpendicular to the long axis of the tibia in the coronal plane but is typically sloped 4 7 posteriorly in the sagittal plane to match the normal slope of the tibia. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art the sagittal slope can be 0 where the device to be implanted does not require a sloped tibial cut. The resection line is perpendicular to the mechanical axis but the angle between the resection line and the surface plane of the plateau varies depending on the amount of damage to the knee.

The plateau of the femur is resected to provide flat surfaces that communicate with the interior of the femoral prosthesis. The cuts made to the femur are based on the overall height of the gap to be created between the tibia and the femur. Typically a 20 mm gap is desirable to provide the implanted prosthesis adequate room to achieve full range of motion. The bone is resected at a 5 7 angle valgus to the mechanical axis of the femur. Resected surface forms a flat plane with an angular relationship to adjoining surfaces . The angle between the surfaces and varies according to the design of the implant.

As illustrated in the external geometry of the proximal femur includes the head the neck the lesser trochanter the greater trochanter and the proximal femoral diaphysis. The relative positions of the trochanters the femoral head center and the femoral shaft are correlated with the inclination of the neck shaft angle. The mechanical axis and anatomic axis are also shown. Assessment of these relationships can change the reaming direction to achieve neutral alignment of the prosthesis with the femoral canal.

Using anteroposterior and lateral radiographs measurements are made of the proximal and distal geometry to determine the size and optimal design of the implant.

Typically after obtaining surgical access to the hip joint the femoral neck is resected e.g. along the line . Once the neck is resected the medullary canal is reamed. Reaming can be accomplished for example with a conical or straight reamer or a flexible reamer. The depth of reaming is dictated by the specific design of the implant. Once the canal has been reamed the proximal reamer is prepared by serial rasping with the rasp directed down into the canal.

Further surgical assistance can be provided by using a device applied to the outer surface of the articular cartilage or the bone including the subchondral bone in order to match the alignment of the articular repair system and the recipient site or the joint. The device can be round circular oval ellipsoid curved or irregular in shape. The shape can be selected or adjusted to match or enclose an area of diseased cartilage or an area slightly larger than the area of diseased cartilage or substantially larger than the diseased cartilage. The area can encompass the entire articular surface or the weight bearing surface. Such devices can be used when replacement of a majority or an entire articular surface is contemplated.

Mechanical devices can be used for surgical assistance e.g. surgical tools for example using gels molds plastics or metal. One or more electronic images or intraoperative measurements can be obtained providing object coordinates that define the articular and or bone surface and shape. These objects coordinates can be utilized to either shape the device e.g. using a CAD CAM technique to be adapted to a patient s articular anatomy or alternatively to select a typically pre made device that has a good fit with a patient s articular anatomy. The device can have a surface and shape that will match all or portions of the articular cartilage subchondral bone and or other bone surface and shape e.g. similar to a mirror image. The device can include without limitation one or more cut planes apertures slots and or holes to accommodate surgical instruments such as drills reamers curettes k wires screws and saws.

The device may have a single component or multiple components. The components may be attached to the unoperated and operated portions of the intra or extra articular anatomy. For example one component may be attached to the femoral neck while another component may be in contact with the greater or lesser trochanter. Typically the different components can be used to assist with different parts of the surgical procedure. When multiple components are used one or more components may also be attached to a different component rather than the articular cartilage subchondral bone or other areas of osseous or non osseous anatomy. For example a tibial mold may be attached to a femoral mold and tibial cuts can be performed in reference to femoral cuts.

Components may also be designed to fit to the joint after an operative step has been performed. For example in a knee one component may be designed to fit all or portions of a distal femur before any cuts have been made while another component may be designed to fit on a cut that has been made with the previously used mold or component. In a hip one component may be used to perform an initial cut for example through the femoral neck while another subsequently used component may be designed to fit on the femoral neck after the cut for example covering the area of the cut with a central opening for insertion of a reamer. Using this approach subsequent surgical steps may also be performed with high accuracy e.g. reaming of the marrow cavity.

In another embodiment a guide may be attached to a mold to control the direction and orientation of surgical instruments. For example after the femoral neck has been cut a mold may be attached to the area of the cut whereby it fits portions or all of the exposed bone surface. The mold may have an opening adapted for a reamer. Before the reamer is introduced a femoral reamer guide may be inserted into the mold and advanced into the marrow cavity. The position and orientation of the reamer guide may be determined by the femoral mold. The reamer can then be advanced over the reamer guide and the marrow cavity can be reamed with improved accuracy. Similar approaches are feasible in the knee and other joints.

All mold components may be disposable. Alternatively some molds components may be re usable. Typically mold components applied after a surgical step such as a cut as been performed can be reusable since a reproducible anatomic interface will have been established.

Interconnecting or bridging components may be used. For example such interconnecting or bridging components may couple the mold attached to the joint with a standard unmodified or only minimally modified cut block used during knee or hip surgery. Interconnecting or bridging components may be made of plastic or metal. When made of metal or other hard material they can help protect the joint from plastic debris for example when a reamer or saw would otherwise get into contact with the mold.

The accuracy of the attachment between the component or mold and the cartilage or subchondral bone or other osseous structures can be better than 2 mm better than 1 mm better than 0.7 mm better than 0.5 mm or better than 0.5 mm. The accuracy of the attachment between different components or between one or more molds and one or more surgical instruments can be better than 2 mm better than 1 mm better than 0.7 mm better than 0.5 mm or better than 0.5 mm.

The angular error of any attachments or between any components or between components molds instruments and or the anatomic or biomechanical axes is less than 2 degrees less than 1.5 degrees less than 1 degree and or less than 0.5 degrees. The total angular error can be less than 2 degrees less than 1.5 degrees less than 1 degree and or less than 0.5 degrees.

In various embodiments a position will be chosen that will result in an anatomically desirable cut plane drill hole or general instrument orientation for subsequent placement of an articular repair system or for facilitating placement of the articular repair system. Moreover the device can be designed so that the depth of the drill reamer or other surgical instrument can be controlled e.g. the drill cannot go any deeper into the tissue than defined by the device and the size of the hole in the block can be designed to essentially match the size of the implant. Information about other joints or axis and alignment information of a joint or extremity can be included when selecting the position of these slots or holes. Alternatively the openings in the device can be made larger than needed to accommodate these instruments. The device can also be configured to conform to the articular shape. The apertures or openings provided can be wide enough to allow for varying the position or angle of the surgical instrument e.g. reamers saws drills curettes and other surgical instruments. An instrument guide typically comprised of a relatively hard material can then be applied to the device. The device helps orient the instrument guide relative to the three dimensional anatomy of the joint.

The mold may contact the entire articular surface. In various embodiments the mold can be in contact with only a portion of the articular surface. Thus the mold can be in contact without limitation with 100 of the articular surface 80 of the articular surface 50 of the articular surface 30 of the articular surface 30 of the articular surface 20 of the articular surface or 10 or less of the articular surface. An advantage of a smaller surface contact area is a reduction in size of the mold thereby enabling cost efficient manufacturing as well as predisposing the implant for implantation using minimally invasive surgical techniques. The size of the mold and its surface contact areas should be sufficient however to ensure accurate placement so that subsequent drilling and cutting can be performed with sufficient accuracy.

In various embodiments the maximum diameter of the mold is less than 10 cm. In other embodiments the maximum diameter of the mold may be less than 8 cm 5 cm 4 cm 3 cm or even less than 2 cm.

The mold may be in contact with three or more surface points rather than an entire surface. These surface points may be on the articular surface or external to the articular surface. By using contact points rather than an entire surface or portions of the surface the size of the mold may be reduced.

Reductions in the size of the mold can be used to enable minimally invasive surgery MIS in the hip the knee the shoulder and other joints. MIS technique with small molds will help to reduce intraoperative blood loss preserve tissue including possibly bone enable muscle sparing techniques and reduce postoperative pain and enable faster recovery. Thus in one embodiment the mold is used in conjunction with a muscle sparing technique. In another embodiment the mold may be used with a bone sparing technique. In another embodiment the mold is shaped to enable MIS technique with an incision size of less than 15 cm or less than 13 cm or less than 10 cm or less than 8 cm or less than 6 cm.

The mold may be placed in contact with points or surfaces outside of the articular surface. For example the mold can rest on bone in the intercondylar notch or the anterior or other aspects of the tibia or the acetabular rim or the lesser or greater trochanter. Optionally the mold may only rest on points or surfaces that are external to the articular surface. Furthermore the mold may rest on points or surfaces within the weight bearing surface or on points or surfaces external to the weight bearing surface.

The mold may be designed to rest on bone or cartilage outside the area to be worked on e.g. cut drilled etc. In this manner multiple surgical steps can be performed using the same mold. For example in the knee the mold may be stabilized against portions of the intercondylar notch which can be selected external to areas to be removed for total knee arthroplasty or other procedures. In the hip the mold may be attached external to the acetabular fossa providing a reproducible reference that is maintained during a procedure for example total hip arthroplasty. The mold may be affixed to the underlying bone for example with pins or drills etc.

In additional embodiments the mold may rest on the articular cartilage. The mold may rest on the subchondral bone or on structures external to the articular surface that are within the joint space or on structures external to the joint space. If the mold is designed to rest on the cartilage an imaging test demonstrating the articular cartilage can be used in one embodiment. This can for example include ultrasound spiral CT arthrography MRI using for example cartilage displaying pulse sequences or MRI arthrography. In another embodiment an imaging test demonstrating the subchondral bone e.g. CT or spiral CT can be used and a standard cartilage thickness can be added to the scan. The standard cartilage thickness can be derived for example using an anatomic reference database age gender and race matching age adjustments and any method known in the art or developed in the future for deriving estimates of cartilage thickness. The standard cartilage thickness may in some embodiments be uniform across one or more articular surfaces or it can change across the articular surface.

The mold may be adapted to rest substantially on subchondral bone. In this case residual cartilage can create some offset and inaccurate result with resultant inaccuracy in surgical cuts drilling and the like. In various embodiments portions of the residual cartilage can be removed in a first step in areas where the mold is designed to contact the bone and the subchondral bone is exposed. In a second step the mold is then placed on the subchondral bone.

With advanced osteoarthritis significant articular deformity can result. The articular surface s can become flattened. There can be cyst formation or osteophyte formation. Tram track like structures can form on the articular surface. In one embodiment osteophytes or other deformities may be removed by the computer software prior to generation of the mold. The software can automatically semi automatically or manually with input from the user simulate surgical removal of the osteophytes or other deformities and predict the resulting shape of the joint and the associated surfaces. The mold can then be designed based on the predicted shape. Intraoperatively these osteophytes or other deformities can then also optionally be removed prior to placing the mold and performing the procedure. Alternatively the mold can be designed to avoid such deformities such as by incorporating one or more anatomical relief surfaces. For example the mold may only be in contact with points on the articular surface or external to the articular surface that are not affected or involved by osteophytes. The mold can rest on the articular surface or external to the articular surface on three or more points or small surfaces with the body of the mold elevated or detached from the articular surface so that the accuracy of its position cannot be affected by osteophytes or other articular deformities. The mold can rest on one or more tibial spines or portions of the tibial spines. Alternatively all or portions of the mold may be designed to rest on osteophytes or other excrescences or pathological changes.

The surgeon can optionally make fine adjustments between the alignment device and the instrument guide. In this manner an optimal compromise can be found for example between biomechanical alignment and joint laxity or biomechanical alignment and joint function e.g. in a knee joint flexion gap and extension gap. By oversizing the openings in the alignment guide the surgeon can utilize the instruments and insert them in the instrument guide without damaging the alignment guide. Thus in particular if the alignment guide is made of plastic debris will not be introduced into the joint. The position and orientation between the alignment guide and the instrument guide can be also be optimized with the use of for example interposed spacers wedges screws and other mechanical or electrical methods known in the art.

A surgeon may desire to influence joint laxity as well as joint alignment. This can be optimized for different flexion and extension abduction or adduction internal and external rotation angles. For this purpose for example spacers can be introduced that are attached or that are in contact with one or more molds. The surgeon can intraoperatively evaluate the laxity or tightness of a joint using spacers with different thickness or one or more spacers with the same thickness. For example spacers can be applied in a knee joint in the presence of one or more molds and the flexion gap can be evaluated with the knee joint in flexion. The knee joint can then be extended and the extension gap can be evaluated. Ultimately the surgeon will select an optimal combination of spacers for a given joint and mold. A surgical cut guide can be applied to the mold with the spacers optionally interposed between the mold and the cut guide. In this manner the exact position of the surgical cuts can be influenced and can be adjusted to achieve an optimal result. Thus the position of a mold can be optimized relative to the joint bone or cartilage for soft tissue tension ligament balancing or for flexion extension rotation abduction adduction anteversion retroversion and other joint or bone positions and motion. The position of a cut block or other surgical instrument may be optimized relative to the mold for soft tissue tension or for ligament balancing or for flexion extension rotation abduction adduction anteversion retroversion and other joint or bone positions and motion. Both the position of the mold and the position of other components including cut blocks and surgical instruments may be optimized for soft tissue tension or for ligament balancing or for flexion extension rotation abduction adduction anteversion retroversion and other joint or bone positions and motion.

Someone skilled in the art will recognize other means for optimizing the position of the surgical cuts or other interventions. As stated above expandable or ratchet like devices may be utilized that can be inserted into the joint or that can be attached or that can touch the mold see also . Such devices can extend from a cutting block or other devices attached to the mold optimizing the position of drill holes or cuts for different joint positions or they can be integrated inside the mold. Integration in the cutting block or other devices attached to the mold is contemplated since the expandable or ratchet like mechanisms can be sterilized and re used during other surgeries for example in other patients. Optionally the expandable or ratchet like devices may be disposable. The expandable or ratchet like devices may extend to the joint without engaging or contacting the mold alternatively these devices may engage or contact the mold. Hinge like mechanisms are applicable. Similarly jack like mechanisms are useful. In principal any mechanical or electrical device useful for fine tuning the position of the cut guide relative to the molds may be used. These embodiments are helpful for soft tissue tension optimization and ligament balancing in different joints for different static positions and during joint motion.

A surgeon may desire to influence joint laxity as well as joint alignment. This can be optimized for different flexion and extension abduction or adduction internal and external rotation angles. For this purpose for example spacers or expandable or ratchet like can be utilized that can be attached or that can be in contact with one or more molds. The surgeon can intraoperatively evaluate the laxity or tightness of a joint using spacers with different thickness or one or more spacers with the same thickness or using such expandable or ratchet like devices. For example spacers or a ratchet like device can be applied in a knee joint in the presence of one or more molds and the flexion gap can be evaluated with the knee joint in flexion. The knee joint can then be extended and the extension gap can be evaluated. Ultimately the surgeon will select an optimal combination of spacers or an optimal position for an expandable or ratchet like device for a given joint and mold. A surgical cut guide can be applied to the mold with the spacers or the expandable or ratchet like device optionally interposed between the mold and the cut guide or in select embodiments between the mold and the joint or the mold and an opposite articular surface. In this manner the exact position of the surgical cuts can be influenced and can be adjusted to achieve an optimal result. Someone skilled in the art will recognize other means for optimizing the position of the surgical cuts or drill holes. For example expandable or ratchet like devices can be utilized that can be inserted into the joint or that can be attached or that can touch the mold. Hinge like mechanisms are applicable. Similarly jack like mechanisms are useful. In principal any mechanical or electrical device useful for fine tuning the position of the cut guide relative to the molds can be used.

The template and any related instrumentation such as spacers or ratchets can be combined with a tensiometer to provide a better intraoperative assessment of the joint. The tensiometer can be utilized to further optimize the anatomic alignment and tightness of the joint and to improve post operative function and outcomes. Optionally local contact pressures may be evaluated intraoperatively for example using a sensor like the ones manufactured by Tekscan South Boston Mass. The contact pressures can be measured between the mold and the joint or between the mold and any attached devices such as a surgical cut block.

The template may be a mold that can be made of a plastic or polymer. The mold may be produced by rapid prototyping technology in which successive layers of plastic are laid down as know in the art. In other embodiments the template or portions of the template can be made of metal. The mold can be milled or made using laser based manufacturing techniques.

The template may be casted using rapid prototyping and for example lost wax technique. It may also be milled. For example a preformed mold with a generic shape can be used at the outset which can then be milled to the patient specific dimensions. The milling may only occur on one surface of the mold such as the surface that faces the articular surface. Milling and rapid prototyping techniques may be combined.

Curable materials may be used which can be poured into forms that are for example generated using rapid prototyping. For example liquid metal may be used. Cured materials may optionally be milled or the surface can be further refined using other techniques.

Metal inserts may be applied to plastic components. For example a plastic mold may have at least one guide aperture to accept a reaming device or a saw. A metal insert may be used to provide a hard wall to accept the reamer or saw. Using this or similar designs can be useful to avoid the accumulation of plastic or other debris in the joint when the saw or other surgical instruments may get in contact with the mold. Other hard materials can be used to serve as inserts. These can also include for example hard plastics or ceramics.

In another embodiment the mold does not have metallic inserts to accept a reaming device or saw. The metal inserts or guides may be part of an attached device that is typically in contact with the mold. A metallic drill guide or a metallic saw guide may thus for example have metallic or hard extenders that reach through the mold thereby for example also stabilizing any devices applied to the mold against the physical body of the mold.

The template may not only be used for assisting the surgical technique and guiding the placement and direction of surgical instruments. In addition the templates can be utilized for guiding the placement of the implant or implant components. For example in the hip joint tilting of the acetabular component is a frequent problem with total hip arthroplasty. A template can be applied to the acetabular wall with an opening in the center large enough to accommodate the acetabular component that the surgeon intends to place. The template can have receptacles or notches that match the shape of small extensions that can be part of the implant or that can be applied to the implant. For example the implant can have small members or extensions applied to the twelve o clock and six o clock positions. By aligning these members with notches or receptacles in the mold the surgeon can ensure that the implant is inserted without tilting or rotation. These notches or receptacles can also be helpful to hold the implant in place while bone cement is hardening in cemented designs.

One or more templates can be used during the surgery. For example in the hip a template can be initially applied to the proximal femur that closely approximates the 3D anatomy prior to the resection of the femoral head. The template can include an opening to accommodate a saw. The opening is positioned to achieve an optimally placed surgical cut for subsequent reaming and placement of the prosthesis. A second template can then be applied to the proximal femur after the surgical cut has been made. The second template can be useful for guiding the direction of a reamer prior to placement of the prosthesis. As can be seen in this as well as in other examples templates can be made for joints prior to any surgical intervention. However it is also possible to make templates that are designed to fit to a bone or portions of a joint after the surgeon has already performed selected surgical procedures such as cutting reaming drilling etc. The template can account for the shape of the bone or the joint resulting from these procedures.

In certain embodiments the surgical assistance device comprises an array of adjustable closely spaced pins e.g. plurality of individually moveable mechanical elements . One or more electronic images or intraoperative measurements can be obtained providing object coordinates that define the articular and or bone surface and shape. These objects coordinates can be entered or transferred into the device for example manually or electronically and the information can be used to create a surface and shape that will match all or portions of the articular and or bone surface and shape by moving one or more of the elements e.g. similar to an image. The device can include slots and holes to accommodate surgical instruments such as drills curettes k wires screws and saws. The position of these slots and holes may be adjusted by moving one or more of the mechanical elements. Typically a position will be chosen that will result in an anatomically desirable cut plane reaming direction or drill hole or instrument orientation for subsequent placement of an articular repair system or for facilitating the placement of an articular repair system.

Information about other joints or axis and alignment information of a joint or extremity can be included when selecting the position of the without limitation cut planes apertures slots or holes on the template. The biomechanical and or anatomic axes may be derived using above described imaging techniques including without limitation a standard radiograph including a load bearing radiograph for example an upright knee x ray or a whole leg length film e.g. hip to foot . These radiographs may be acquired in different projections for example anteroposterior posteroanterior lateral oblique etc. The biomechanical and anatomic axes may also be derived using other imaging modalities such as CT scan or MRI scan a CT scout scan or MRI localized scans through portions or all of the extremity either alone or in combination as described in above embodiments. For example when total or partial knee arthroplasty is contemplated a spiral CT scan may be obtained through the knee joint. The spiral CT scan through the knee joint serves as the basis for generating the negative contour template s mold s that will be affixed to portions or all of the knee joint. Additional CT or MRI scans may be obtained through the hip and ankle joint. These may be used to define the centroids or centerpoints in each joint or other anatomic landmarks for example and then to derive the biomechanical and other axes.

In another embodiment the biomechanical axis may be established using non image based approaches including traditional surgical instruments and measurement tools such as intramedullary rods alignment guides and also surgical navigation. For example in a knee joint optical or radiofrequency markers can be attached to the extremity. The lower limb may then be rotated around the hip joint and the position of the markers can be recorded for different limb positions. The center of the rotation will determine the center of the femoral head. Similar reference points may be determined in the ankle joint etc. The position of the templates or more typically the position of surgical instruments relative to the templates may then be optimized for a given biomechanical load pattern for example in varus or valgus alignment. Thus by performing these measurements pre or intraoperatively the position of the surgical instruments may be optimized relative to the molds and the cuts can be placed to correct underlying axis errors such as varus or valgus malalignment or ante or retroversion.

In various embodiments upon imaging a physical template of a joint such as a knee joint or hip joint or ankle joint or shoulder joint can be generated. The template can be used to perform image guided surgical procedures such as partial or complete joint replacement articular resurfacing or ligament repair. The template may include reference points or opening or apertures for surgical instruments such as drills saws burrs and the like.

In order to derive an optimal orientation of drill holes cut planes saw planes and the like openings or receptacles in said template or attachments can be adjusted to account for at least one axis. The axis can be anatomic or biomechanical for example for a knee joint a hip joint an ankle joint a shoulder joint or an elbow joint.

In one embodiment only a single axis is used for placing and optimizing such drill holes saw planes cut planes and or other surgical interventions. This axis may be for example an anatomical or biomechanical axis. In one embodiment a combination of axis and or planes can be used for optimizing the placement of the drill holes saw planes cut planes or other surgical interventions. For example two axes e.g. one anatomical and one biomechanical can be factored into the position shape or orientation of the 3D guided template and related attachments or linkages. For example two axes e.g. one anatomical and biomechanical and one plane e.g. the top plane defined by the tibial plateau can be used. Alternatively two or more planes can be used e.g. a coronal and a sagittal plane as defined by the image or by the patients anatomy.

Angle and distance measurements and surface topography measurements may be performed in these one or more two or more or three or more multiple planes as contemplated and or necessary. These angle measurements can for example yield information on varus or valgus deformity flexion or extension deficit hyper or hypo flexion or hyper or hypo extension abduction adduction internal or external rotation deficit or hyper or hypo abduction hyper or hypo adduction hyper or hypo internal or external rotation.

Single or multi axis line or plane measurements can then be utilized to determine various angles of correction e.g. by adjusting surgical cut or saw planes or other surgical interventions. Typically two axis corrections will be desirable over a single axis correction a two plane correction will be desirable over a single plane correction and so forth.

In accordance with another embodiment more than one drilling cut boring and or reaming or other surgical intervention is performed for a particular treatment such as the placement of a joint resurfacing or replacing implant or components thereof. These two or more surgical interventions e.g. drilling cutting reaming sawing are made in relationship to a biomechanical axis and or an anatomical axis and or an implant axis. The 3D guidance template or attachments or linkages thereto include two or more openings guides apertures or reference planes to make at least two or more drillings reamings borings sawings or cuts in relationship to a biomechanical axis an anatomical axis an implant axis or other axis derived therefrom or related thereto.

While in simple embodiments it is possible that only a single cut or drilling will be made in relationship to a biomechanical axis an anatomical axis an implant axis and or an axis related thereto in most meaningful implementations two or more drillings borings reamings cutting and or sawings will be performed or combinations thereof in relationship to a biomechanical anatomical and or implant axis.

For example an initial cut may be placed in relationship to a biomechanical axis of particular joint. A subsequent drilling cut or other intervention can be performed in relation to an anatomical axis. Both can be designed to achieve a correction in a biomechanical axis and or anatomical axis. In another example an initial cut can be performed in relationship to a biomechanical axis while a subsequent cut is performed in relationship to an implant axis or an implant plane. Any combination in surgical interventions and in relating them to any combination of biomechanical anatomical implant axis or planes related thereto is possible. In various embodiments it is desirable that a single cut or drilling be made in relationship to a biomechanical or anatomical axis. Subsequent cuts or drillings or other surgical interventions can then be made in reference to said first intervention. These subsequent interventions can be performed directly off the same 3D guidance template or they can be performed by attaching surgical instruments or linkages or reference frames or secondary or other templates to the first template or the cut plane or hole and the like created with the first template.

In another embodiment a frame can be applied to the bone or the cartilage in areas other than the diseased bone or cartilage. The frame can include holders and guides for surgical instruments. The frame can be attached to one or more previously defined anatomic reference points. Alternatively the position of the frame can be cross registered relative to one or more anatomic landmarks using an imaging test or intraoperative measurement for example one or more fluoroscopic images acquired intraoperatively. One or more electronic images or intraoperative measurements including using mechanical devices can be obtained providing object coordinates that define the articular and or bone surface and shape. These objects coordinates can be entered or transferred into the device for example manually or electronically and the information can be used to move one or more of the holders or guides for surgical instruments. Typically a position will be chosen that will result in a surgically or anatomically desirable cut plane or drill hole orientation for subsequent placement of an articular repair system. Information about other joints or axis and alignment information of a joint or extremity can be included when selecting the position of these slots or holes.

In various embodiments the template may include a reference element such as a pin that upon positioning of the template on the articular surface establishes a reference plane relative to a biomechanical axis or an anatomical axis or plane of a limb. For example in a knee surgery the reference element may establish a reference plane from the center of the hip to the center of the ankle. In other embodiments the reference element may establish an axis that subsequently be used a surgical tool to correct an axis deformity.

In these embodiments the template can be created directly from the joint during surgery or alternatively created from an image of the joint for example using one or more computer programs to determine object coordinates defining the surface contour of the joint and transferring e.g. dialing in these co ordinates to the tool. Subsequently the tool can be aligned accurately over the joint and accordingly the surgical instrument guide or the implant will be more accurately placed in or over the articular surface.

In both single use and re useable embodiments the tool can be designed so that the instrument controls the depth and or direction of the drill i.e. the drill cannot go any deeper into the tissue than the instrument allows and the size of the hole or aperture in the instrument can be designed to essentially match the size of the implant. The tool can be used for general prosthesis implantation including but not limited to the articular repair implants described herein and for reaming the marrow in the case of a total arthroplasty.

Identification and preparation of the implant site and insertion of the implant can be supported by a surgical navigation system. In such a system the position or orientation of a surgical instrument with respect to the patient s anatomy can be tracked in real time in one or more 2D or 3D images. These 2D or 3D images can be calculated from images that were acquired preoperatively such as MR or CT images. Non image based surgical navigation systems that find axes or anatomical structures for example with use of joint motion can also be used. The position and orientation of the surgical instrument as well as the mold including alignment guides surgical instrument guides reaming guides drill guides saw guides etc. can be determined from markers attached to these devices. These markers can be located by a detector using for example optical acoustical or electromagnetic signals.

Identification and preparation of the implant site and insertion of the implant can also be supported with use of a C arm system. The C arm system can afford imaging of the joint in one or multiple planes. The multiplanar imaging capability can aid in defining the shape of an articular surface. This information can be used to selected an implant with a good fit to the articular surface. Currently available C arm systems also afford cross sectional imaging capability for example for identification and preparation of the implant site and insertion of the implant. C arm imaging can be combined with administration of radiographic contrast.

In various embodiments the surgical devices described herein can include one or more materials that harden to form a mold of the articular surface. In various embodiments the materials used are biocompatible such as without limitation acylonitrile butadiene styrene polyphenylsulfone and polycarbonate. As used herein biocompatible shall mean any material that is not toxic to the body e.g. produces a negative reaction under ISO 10993 standards incorporated herein by reference . In various embodiments these biocompatible materials may be compatible with rapid prototyping techniques.

In further embodiments the mold material is capable of heat sterilization without deformation. An exemplary mold material is polyphenylsulfone which does not deform up to a temperature of 207 C. Alternatively the mold may be capable of sterilization using gases e.g. ethyleneoxide. The mold may be capable of sterilization using radiation e.g. radiation. The mold may be capable of sterilization using hydrogen peroxide or other chemical means. The mold may be capable of sterilization using any one or more methods of sterilization known in the art or developed in the future.

A wide variety of materials capable of hardening in situ include polymers that can be triggered to undergo a phase change for example polymers that are liquid or semi liquid and harden to solids or gels upon exposure to air application of ultraviolet light visible light exposure to blood water or other ionic changes. See also U.S. Pat. No. 6 443 988 to Felt et al. issued Sep. 3 2002 and documents cited therein . Non limiting examples of suitable curable and hardening materials include polyurethane materials e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 443 988 to Felt et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 288 797 to Khalil issued Feb. 22 1994 U.S. Pat. No. 4 098 626 to Graham et al. issued Jul. 4 1978 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 594 380 to Chapin et al. issued Jun. 10 1986 and Lu et al. 2000 BioMaterials 21 15 1595 1605 describing porous poly L lactide acid foams hydrophilic polymers as disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 162 430 hydrogel materials such as those described in Wake et al. 1995 Cell Transplantation 4 3 275 279 Wiese et al. 2001 J. Biomedical Materials Research 54 2 179 188 and Marler et al. 2000 Plastic Reconstruct. Surgery 105 6 2049 2058 hyaluronic acid materials e.g. Duranti et al. 1998 Dermatologic Surgery 24 12 1317 1325 expanding beads such as chitin beads e.g. Yusof et al. 2001 J. Biomedical Materials Research 54 1 59 68 crystal free metals such as Liquidmetals and or materials used in dental applications See e.g. Brauer and Antonucci Dental Applications pp. 257 258 in Concise Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering and U.S. Pat. No. 4 368 040 to Weissman issued Jan. 11 1983 . Any biocompatible material that is sufficiently flowable to permit it to be delivered to the joint and there undergo complete cure in situ under physiologically acceptable conditions can be used. The material can also be biodegradable.

The curable materials can be used in conjunction with a surgical tool as described herein. For example the surgical tool can be a template that includes one or more apertures therein adapted to receive injections and the curable materials can be injected through the apertures. Prior to solidifying in situ the materials will conform to the articular surface subchondral bone and or articular cartilage facing the surgical tool and accordingly will form a mirror and or negative image impression of the surface upon hardening thereby recreating a normal or near normal articular surface.

In addition curable materials or surgical tools can also be used in conjunction with any of the imaging tests and analysis described herein for example by molding these materials or surgical tools based on an image of a joint. For example rapid prototyping may be used to perform automated construction of the template. The rapid prototyping may include the use of without limitation 3D printers stereolithography machines or selective laser sintering systems. Rapid prototyping is a typically based on computer aided manufacturing CAM . Although rapid prototyping traditionally has been used to produce prototypes they are now increasingly being employed to produce tools or even to manufacture production quality parts. In an exemplary rapid prototyping method a machine reads in data from a CAD drawing and lays down successive millimeter thick layers of plastic or other engineering material and in this way the template can be built from a long series of cross sections. These layers are glued together or fused often using a laser to create the cross section described in the CAD drawing.

A variety of techniques can be used to derive the shape of the template as described above. For example a few selected CT slices through the hip joint along with a full spiral CT through the knee joint and a few selected slices through the ankle joint can be used to help define the axes if surgery is contemplated of the knee joint. Once the axes are defined the shape of the subchondral bone can be derived followed by applying standardized cartilage loss.

Methodologies for stabilizing the 3D guidance templates will now be described. The 3D guide template may be stabilized using multiple surgical tools such as without limitation K wires a drill bit anchored into the bone and left within the template to stabilize it against the bone one or more convexities or cavities on the surface facing the cartilage bone stabilization against intra extra articular surfaces optionally with extenders for example from an articular surface onto an extra articular surface and or stabilization against newly placed cuts or other surgical interventions.

Specific anatomic landmarks may be selected in the design and make of the 3D guide template in order to further optimize the anatomic stabilization. For example a 3D guidance template may be designed to with an anatomical relief or other such structure or absence of structure to cover portions or all off an osteophyte or bone spur in order to enhance anchoring of the 3D guide template against the underlying articular anatomy. The 3D guidance template may be designed to the shape of a trochlear or intercondylar notch and can encompass multiple anatomic areas such as a trochlea a medial and a lateral femoral condyle at the same time. In the tibia a 3D guide template may be designed to encompass a medial and lateral tibial plateau at the same time and it can optionally include the tibial spine for optimized stabilization and cross referencing. In a hip the fovea capitis may be utilized in order to stabilize a 3D guide template. Optionally the surgeon may elect to resect the ligamentum capitis femoris in order to improve the stabilization. Also in the hip an acetabular mold can be designed to extend into the region of the tri radiate cartilage the medial lateral superior inferior anterior and posterior acetabular wall or ring. By having these extensions and additional features for stabilization a more reproducible position of the 3D template can be achieved with resulted improvement in accuracy of the surgical procedure. Typically a template with more than one convexity or concavity or multiple convexities or concavities including relevant anatomical relief surfaces will provide better cross referencing in the anatomic surface and higher accuracy and higher stabilization than compared to a mold that has only few surface features such as a singular convexity. Thus in order to improve the implementation and intraoperative accuracy careful surgical planning and preoperative planning is desired that encompasses more than one convexity more than two convexities and or more than three convexities or that encompasses more than one concavity more than two concavities or more than three concavities on an articular surface or adjoined surface including bone and cartilage outside the weight bearing surface.

In another embodiment more than one convexity and concavity more than two convexities and concavities and or more then three convexities and concavities are included in the surface of the mold in order to optimize the interoperative cross referencing and in order to stabilize the mold prior to any surgical intervention.

Turning now to particular 3D surgical template configurations and to templates for specific joint applications which are intended to teach the concept of the design as it would then apply to other joints in the body.

In various embodiments the 3D guidance template may include a surface that duplicates the inner surface of an implant or an implant component and or that conforms to an articular surface at least partially. More than one of the surfaces of the template may match or conform to one or more of the surfaces or portions of one or more of these surfaces of an implant implant component and or articular surface.

In one embodiment shown in the surface of the template facing the joint is a mirror and or negative image of at least portions of the surface of the joint that is healthy or substantially unaffected by the arthritic process. A recessed area or anatomical relief can be present to avoid contact with the diseased joint region. This design can be favorable when an imaging test is used that does not provide sufficient detail about the diseased region of the joint to accurately generate a template.

In a similar embodiment shown in the surface of the template facing the joint is a mirror and or negative image of at least portions of the surface of the joint that is healthy or substantially unaffected by the arthritic process. The diseased area is covered by the template but the template includes an anatomical relief portion that is not substantially in contact with the diseased area.

In another embodiment shown in the surface of the template facing the joint is a mirror and or negative image of at least portions of the surface of the joint that are arthritic. The diseased area is covered by the template and the template is in close contact with it. This design can be advantageous to obtain greater accuracy in positioning the template if the arthritic area is well defined on the imaging test e.g. with high resolution spiral CT or near isotropic MRI acquisitions or MRI with image fusion. This design can also provide enhanced stability during surgical interventions by more firmly fixing the template against the irregular underlying surface.

In another embodiment shown in the surface of the template facing the joint is a mirror and or negative image of at least portions of the surface of the joint that are arthritic. The diseased area is covered by the template and the template is in close contact with it. Moreover healthy or substantially normal regions are covered by the template and the template is in close contact with them. The template is also closely mirroring the shape of the interface between substantially normal or near normal and diseased joint tissue . This design can be advantageous to obtain even greater accuracy in positioning the template due to the change in surface profile or contour at the interface and resultant improved placement of the template on the joint surface. This design can also provide enhanced stability during surgical interventions by more firmly fixing and anchoring the template against the underlying surface and the interface .

In various embodiments the template may include guide apertures or reference points for two or more planes or at least one of a cut plane and one of a drill hole or reaming opening for a peg or implant stem.

The distance between two opposing articulating implant components may be optimized intraoperatively for different pose angles of the joint or joint positions such as different degrees of section extension abduction adduction internal and external rotation. For example spacers typically at least partially conforming to the template may be placed between the template of the opposite surface where the opposite surface can be the native uncut joint the cut joint the surgically prepared joint the trial implant or the definitive implant component for that articular surface. Alternatively spacers may be placed between the template and the articular surface for which it will enable subsequent surgical interventions. For example by placing spacers between a tibial template and the tibia the tibial cut height can be optimized. The thicker the spacer or the more spacers interposed between the tibial template and the tibial plateau the less deep the cut will be i.e. the less bone will be removed from the top of the tibia.

The spacers may be non conforming to the template e.g. they may be of a flat nature. The spacers may be convex or concave or include multiple convexities or concavities. The spacers may be partially conforming to the template. For example in one embodiment the surface of the spacer optionally facing the articular surface can be molded and individualized to the articular surface thereby forming a template mold while the opposite surface of the spacer can be flat or curved or have any other non patient specific design. The opposite surface may allow for placement of blocks or other surgical instruments or for linkages to other surgical instruments and measurement devices.

In another embodiment the template may include multiple slots spaced at equal distance or at variable distances wherein these slots allow to perform cuts at multiple cut heights or cut depths that can be decided on intraoperatively. In another embodiment the template may include a ratchet like mechanism wherein the ratchet can be placed between the articular surface and the template or between the template and the opposite surface wherein the opposite surface may include the native uncut opposite surface the cut opposite surface an opposite surface template a trial implant or the implant component designed for the opposite surface. By using a ratchet like device soft tissue tension can be optimized for example for different pose angles of the joint or joint positions such as flexion extension abduction adduction internal rotation and external rotation at one or more degrees for each direction.

Optimizing soft tissue tension will improve joint function that advantageously enhances postoperative performance. Soft tissue tension may for example be optimized with regard to ligament tension or muscle tension but also capsular tension. In the knee joint soft tissue tension optimization includes typically ligament balancing e.g. the cruciate ligaments and or the collateral ligaments for different degrees of knee flexion and knee extension.

In one disclosed embodiment a 3D guidance template may attach to two or more points on the joint. In other embodiments a template may attach to three or more points on the joint four or more points on the joint five or more points on the joint six or more points on the joint seven or more points on the joint ten or more points on the joint or more portions for the entire surface to be replaced.

In another embodiment the template may include one or more linkages for surgical instruments. The linkages may also be utilized for attaching other measurement devices such as alignment guides intramedullary guides laser pointing devices laser measurement devices optical measurement devices radio frequency measurement devices surgical navigation and the like. Someone skilled in the art will recognize many surgical instruments and measurement in alignment devices may be attached to the template. Alternatively these surgical instruments or alignment devices may be included within the template.

In another embodiment a link or a linkage may be attached or may be incorporated or may be part of a template that rests on a first articular surface. Said link or linkage may further extend to a second articular surface which is typically an opposing articular surface. Said link or linkage can thus help cross reference the first articular surface with the second articular surface ultimately assisting the performance of surgical interventions on the second articular surface using the cross reference to the first articular surface. The second articular surface may optionally be cut with a second template. Alternatively the second articular surface may be cut using a standard surgical instrument non individualized that is cross referenced via the link to the surgical mold placed on the first articular surface. The link or linkage may include adjustment means such as ratchets telescoping devices and the like to optimize the spatial relationship between the first articular surface and the second opposing articular surface. This optimization may be performed for different degrees of joint flexion extension abduction adduction and rotation.

In another embodiment the linkage may be made to the cut articular surface or more general an articular surface that has been altered using a template and related surgical intervention. Thus cross reference can be made from the first articular surface from a mold attached to said first articular surface the mold attached to a surgically altered for example cut articular surface the surgical instrument attached to said articular surface altered using the mold e.g. cut or drilled and the like. Someone skilled in the art will easily recognize multiple different variations of this approach. Irrespective of the various variations in a first step the articular surface is surgically altered for example via cutting drilling or reaming using a mold while in the second step cross reference is established with a second articular surface.

By establishing cross reference between said first and said second articular surface either via the template and or prior to or after a surgical intervention the surgical intervention performed on the second articular surface can be performed using greater accuracy and improved usability in relation to said articulating opposing first articular surface.

A fourth template may optionally be used in order to perform an anterior chamfer cut . The fourth template may have a guide aperture or reference plane that can determine the anterior chamfer cut . The fourth template can but need not always have at least one surface matching one or more cut articular surfaces . The fourth template may have one or more outriggers or extenders stabilizing the template against the cut or uncut articular surface.

A fifth template may optionally be used to perform a anterior chamfer cut . The fifth template may have a guide aperture or reference plane that can determine the posterior chamfer cut . The fifth template may have at least one surface matching one or more cut articular surfaces . Oblique planes may help to further stabilize the template during the procedure. The fifth template may have one or more outriggers or extenders stabilizing the template against the cut or uncut articular surface.

In another embodiment an opposite articular side may be cut in reference to a first articular side . Any order or sequence of cutting is possible femur first then tibia tibia first then femur patella first and so forth. A template may be shaped to the uncut or in this example cut first articular side. The template may have stabilizers against the first articular surface for example with extenders into a previously created peg hole for an implant. The template may have a linkage or an extender to a second articular surface . Surgical instruments may be attached to the linkage or extender . In this example a tibial cut guide with multiple apertures or reference planes for a horizontal tibial cut is attached. The tibial cut guide may but may not have a surface matching the tibial surface.

By referencing a first e.g. femoral to a second e.g. tibial cut greater accuracy can be achieved in the alignment of these cuts which will result in improved implant component alignment and less wear. Ratchet like devices or hinge like devices or spacers may be inserted into the space between the first and the second articular surface and soft tissue tension and ligament balancing can be evaluated for different distances achieved between the first and second articular surface with one or more of them being cut or uncut. In this manner soft tissue tension and ligament balancing can be tested during different pose angles e.g. degrees of flexion or extension. Optionally tensiometers can be used. Once an ideal soft tissue tension and or ligament balancing has been achieved the tibial cut may be performed through one of the guide apertures in reference to the femoral cut.

The various embodiments described herein optionally provide for trial implants and trial devices that help test intraoperatively the result of the surgical intervention achieved using the 3D guidance mold. Trial implants or devices can be particularly useful for subsequent adjustments and fine tuning of the surgical intervention for example optimizing soft tissue tension in different articular pose angles.

In another embodiment the templates may also allow for intraoperative adjustments. For example the template may include an opening for a pin. The pin can be placed in the bone and the template can be rotated around the pin thereby optimizing for example medial and lateral ligament tension in a knee joint or thereby optimizing the cut orientation and resultant rotation and alignment of an implant relative to the anatomic or biomechanical axis.

In another embodiment standard tools including alignment guides may be attached to the mold via linkages for example and the attachment can allow for additional adjustments in mold and subsequently implant alignment and rotation.

The above described embodiments can be particularly useful for optimization of soft tissue tension including ligament balancing for example in a knee joint. Optimization of soft tissue tension can advantageously improve post operative function and range of motion.

Linkages may also be utilized to stabilize and fix additional molds or surgical instruments on the articular surface.

Moreover linkages can allow separation of one large mold into multiple smaller molds. The use of multiple smaller linked molds advantageously enable smaller surgical axis with the potential to enhance muscle sparing and to reduce the size of the skin cut.

In another embodiment all or portions of the template may be made of metal metal alloys teflon ceramics. In various other embodiments metal metal alloys teflon ceramics and other hard materials typically materials that offer a hardness of without limitation greater than shore 60D is placed in areas where the surgical instruments will be in contact with the template.

In various embodiments 3D guidance molds may also be utilized for planning the approach and preparing the surgical intervention and conducting the surgical intervention for ligament repair and replacement.

In one example the anterior cruciate ligament is replaced using a 3D guidance mold. The anterior cruciate ligament is a collagenous structure located in the center of the knee joint and is covered by the synovial sheath. The ligament has an average length of thirty 30 to thirty eight 38 millimeters and an average width of ten 10 to eleven 11 millimeters. The ligament is proximally attached to the posterior aspect of the lateral femoral condyle s medial surface. The ligament passes anteriorly medially and distally within the joint to its attachment at the anteromedial region of the tibial plateau between the tibial eminences. The distal portion of the ligament fans out to create a large tibial attachment known as the footprint of the ligament. The ligament has two functional subdivisions which include the anteromedial band and the posterolateral band. The posterolateral band is taut when the knee is extended and the anteromedial band becomes taut when the knee is flexed. Because of its internal architecture and attachments sides on femur and tibia the ACL provides restraint to anterior translation and internal rotation of the tibia in angulation and hyperextension of the knee. The prevalence of ACL injuries are about 1 in 3 000 subjects in the United States and approximately 250 000 new injuries each year.

Other tendon and ligament injuries for example including the rotator cuff the ankle tendons and ligaments or the posterior cruciate ligament can also be highly prevalent and frequent.

Selecting the ideal osseous tunnel sights is a crucial step in ligament reconstruction for example the anterior and posterior cruciate ligament.

In the following paragraphs embodiments will be described in detail as they can be applied to the anterior cruciate ligament. However the various embodiments mentioned below and modifications thereof may often be applicable to other ligaments including the posterior cruciate ligament and also tendons such as tendons around the ankle joint or rotator cuff and shoulder joint.

The normal anterior cruciate ligament is composed of a large number of fibers. Each fiber can have a different length a different origin and a different insertion and is frequently under different tension during the range of motion of the knee joint. One of the limitations of today s ACL graft is that they have parallel fibers. Thus even with ideal selection of the placement of the osseous tunnels fibers of an ACL graft will undergo length and tension changes with range of motion. Therefore today s ACL replacement cannot duplicate the original ligament. However placing the center of the osseous tunnels at the most isometric points maximizes the stability that can be obtained during motion and minimizes later on graft wear and ultimately resultant failure.

In illustrative embodiments 3D guidance templates may be selected and designed to enable highly accurate reproducible and minimally invasive graft tunnels in the femur and the tibia.

In one embodiment imaging such as MRI is performed pre operatively. The images can be utilized to identify the origin of the ligament and its insertion onto the opposing articular surface in the case of an anterior cruciate ligament the tibia. Once the estimated location of the origin and the footprint i.e. the insertion of the ligament has been identified 3D guidance templates may be made to be applied to these areas or their vicinity.

The 3D guidance templates may be made and shaped to the articular surface for example adjacent to the intended tunnel location or they may be shaped to bone or cartilage outside the weight bearing zone for example in the intercondylar notch. A 3D guidance template for femoral or tibial tunnel placement for ACL repair may include blocks attachments or linkages for reference points or guide aperture to guide and direct the direction and orientation of a drill and optionally also the drill depth. Optionally the 3D guidance templates may be hollow. The 3D guidance templates may be circular semi circular or ellipsoid. The 3D guidance templates may have a central opening to accommodate a drill.

In one embodiment the 3D guidance template is placed on over or near the intended femoral or tibial entry point and subsequently the drill hole. Once proper anatomic positioning has been achieved the ligament tunnel can be created. The 3D guidance template its shape position and orientation may be optimized to reflect the desired tunnel location in the femur and the tibia wherein the tunnel location position orientation and angulation is selected to achieve the best possible functional results. Additional considerations in placing the femoral or tibial tunnel includes a sufficient distance to the cortical bone in order to avoid failure or fracture of the tunnel.

Thus optionally the distance of the tunnel to the adjacent cortical bone and also other articular structures may optionally be factored into the position shape and orientation of the femoral or tibial 3D guidance templates in order to achieve the optimal compromise between optimal ligament function and possible post operative complications such as failure of the tunnel.

In another embodiment the imaging test may be utilized to determine the origin and insertion of the ligament. This determination can be performed on the basis of bony landmarks identified on the scan e.g. a CT scan or MRI scan. Alternatively this determination can be performed by identifying ligament remnants for example in the area of the ligament origin and ligament attachment. By determining the origin and the insertion of the ligament the intended graft length may be estimated and measured. This measurement may be performed for different pose angles of the joint such as different degrees of flexion extension abduction adduction internal and external rotation.

In another embodiment the imaging test may be utilized to identify the ideal graft harvest site wherein the graft harvest site can optionally be chosen to include sufficiently long ligament portion and underlying bone block proximally and distally in order to fulfill the requirement for graft length as measured earlier in the imaging test. An additional 3D guidance template for the same 3D guidance templates possibly with linkages may be utilized to harvest the ligament and bone from the donor site in the case of an autograft. Optionally 3D guidance templates may also be utilized or designed or shaped or selected to guide the extent of an optional notchplasty. This can include for example the removal of osteophytes.

In the case of an ACL replacement the 3D guidance templates may in this manner optimize selection of femoral and tibial tunnel sites. Tunnel sites may even be optimized for different knee pose angles i.e. joint positions and different range of motion. Selecting the properly positioned femoral tunnel site ensures maximum post operative knee stability.

The intra articular site of the tibial tunnel has less effect on changes in graft length but its position can be optimized using proper placement position and shape of 3D guidance templates to prevent intercondular notch impingement.

Moreover the 3D guidance templates may include an optional stop for the drill for example to avoid damage to adjacent neurovascular bundles or adjacent articular structures including the articular cartilage or other ligaments.

Optionally the 3D guidance templates may also include a stop for example for a drill in order to include the drill depth.

The direction and orientation of the tibial tunnel and also the femoral tunnel may be determined with use of the 3D guidance template whereby it will also include selection of an optimal tunnel orientation in order to match graft length as measured pre operatively with the tunnel length and the intra articular length of the graft ligament.

In one embodiment a tibial 3D guidance template is for example selected so that its opening is located immediately posterior to the anatomic center of the ACL tibial footprint. Anatomic landmarks may be factored into the design shape orientation and position of the tibial guidance template optionally. These include without limitation the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus the medial tibial spine the posterior cruciate ligament and the anterior cruciate ligament stump.

The tunnel site may be located utilizing the 3D guidance template in the anterior posterior plane by extending a line in continuation with the inner edge of the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus. This plane will typically be located six 6 to seven 7 millimeters anterior to the interior border of the PCL. The position shape and orientation of the 3D guidance template will be typically so that the resultant tibial tunnel and the resultant location and orientation of the ACL graft once in place may touch the lateral aspect of the PCL but will not significantly deflect it. Similarly the location of the tibial guidance template and the resultant ligament tunnel and the resultant location of the ACL graft once in place may be chosen so that the graft will neither abrade nor impinge against the medial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle or the roof of the intercondylar notch when the knee is for example in full extension. In this manner highly accurate graft placement is possible thereby avoiding the problems of impingement and subsequent graft failure.

In another embodiment the pre operative scan can be evaluated to determine the maximal possible graft length for example patella tendon graft. If there is concern that the maximal graft length is not sufficient for the intended ACL replacement the tunnel location and orientation specifically the exits from the femur or the tibia can be altered and optimized in order to match the graft length with the tunnel length and intra articular length.

In one embodiment the graft length is measured or simulated pre operatively for example by measuring the optimal graft length for different flexion and extension angles. Using this approach an optimal position shape orientation and design of the 3D guidance template may be derived at an optimal compromise between isometric graft placement avoidance of impingement onto the PCL and or avoidance of impingement onto the femoral condyle maximizing achievable graft lengths.

Intraoperatively the femoral and or tibial 3D guidance templates may include adjustment means. These adjustment means can for example allow movement of the template by one or two or more millimeters intervals in posterior or medial or lateral orientation with resultant movement of the femoral or tibial tunnel. Additionally intraoperative adjustment may also allow for rotation of the template with resultant rotation of the resultant femoral or tibial tunnels.

A single template may be utilized to derive the femoral tunnel. A single template may also be utilized to derive the tibial tunnel. More than one template may be used on either side.

Optionally the templates may include linkages for example for attaching additional measurement devices guide wires or other surgical instruments. Alignment guides including mechanical electrical or optical devices may be attached or incorporated in this manner.

In another embodiment the opposite articular surface may be cross referenced against a first articular surface. For example in the case of an ACL repair the femoral tunnel may be prepared first using a 3D guidance template whereby the 3D guidance template helps determine the optimal femoral tunnel position location orientation diameter and shape. The femoral guidance template may include a link inferiorly to the tibia or an attachable linkage wherein said link or said attachable linkage may be utilized to determine the ideal articular entry point for the tibial tunnel. In this manner the tibial tunnel can be created in an anatomic environment and in mechanical cross reference with the femoral tunnel. The reverse approach is possible whereby the tibial tunnel is created first using the 3D guidance template with a link or linkage to a subsequently created femoral tunnel. Creating the femoral or tibial tunnel in reference to each other advantageously helps reduce the difficulty in performing the ligament repair and also can improve the accuracy of the surgery in select clinical situations.

In another embodiment the template for ligament repair may include exterior anatomical reliefs such as optional flanges or extenders. These flanges or extenders may have the function of tissue retractors. By having tissue retractor function the intra articular template for ligament repair can provide the surgeon with a clearer entry to the intended site of surgical intervention and improve visualization. Moreover flanges or extenders originating from or attached to the 3D guidance templates may also serve as tissue protectors for example protecting the posterior cruciate ligament the articular cartilage or other articular structures as well as extra articular structures.

In another embodiment an additional 3D guidance template or linkages to a first or second articular 3D guidance templates can be utilized to place ligament attachment means for example interference screws.

If an allograft is chosen and the allograft length and optionally dimensions are known pre operatively additional adjustments may be made to the position shape and orientation of the 3D guidance templates and additional tunnels in order to match graft dimensions with tunnel dimensions and graft length with intra femoral tunnel length intra articular length and intra tibial tunnel length. Optionally this adjustment and optimization can be performed for different pose angles of the joint e.g. different degrees of flexion or extension.

A tibial template may be used to determine the location and orientation of the tibial tunnel . Specifically an opening within the tibial mold will determine the position angle and orientation of the tibial tunnel . The opening may include optional metal sleeves . At least one surface of the tibial template will substantially match the surface of the tibia . The template may be matched to a tibial spine wherein the tibial spine can help identify the correct position of the mold and help fix the template in place during the surgical intervention. Of note the sleeves and may be made of other hard materials e.g. ceramics. The femoral and or tibial template may be optionally attached to the femoral or tibial articular surface during the procedure for example using K wires or screws.

All of the embodiments described above may also be applied to PCL repair as well as the repair of other ligaments or tendons.

For PCL repair 3D guidance templates may be designed for single as well as double bundle surgical technique. With single bundle surgical technique a 3D guidance template may be created with a position orientation and shape of the template or associated reference points or guide apertures for surgical instruments that will help create a femoral tunnel in the location of the anatomic origin of the ligament. Alternatively the template and any related reference points or guide apertures or linkages may be designed and placed so that an anterior placement of the femoral tunnel in the anatomic footprint is performed. A more anterior placement of the femoral tunnel can restore normal knee laxity better than isometric graft placement. The 3D guidance templates may be designed so that optimal tension is achieved not only in knee extension but also in knee flexion particularly ninety degrees of knee flexion. Thus the origin and the insertion of the PCL may be identified pre operatively on the scan either by identifying residual fiber bundles or by identifying the underlying anatomic landmarks. The distance between the origin and the insertion may thus be determined in the extension and can be simulated for different flexion degrees or other articular positions. Femoral and tibial tunnel placement and orientation may then be optimized in order to achieve an isometric or near isometric ligament placement. Intraoperative adjustments are feasible as described in the foregoing embodiments.

A 3D guidance template may also be designed both on the femoral as well as on the tibial side using double bundle reconstruction techniques. With double bundle reconstruction techniques the femoral or tibial template can include or incorporate links or can have attachable linkages so that a femoral tunnel can be created and cross referenced with a tibial tunnel or a tibial tunnel can be created and cross referenced to a femoral tunnel.

As described for the ACL the templates may include stops for drills and reaming devices or other surgical instruments for example to protect popliteal neurovascular structures. The templates may include extenders or flanges to serve as tissue retractors as well as tissue protectors.

In principle templates may be designed to be compatible with any desired surgical technique. In the case of PCL repair templates may be designed to be compatible with single bundle or a double bundle reconstruction tibial inlay techniques as well as other approaches.

As previously stated 3D guidance templates are applicable to any type of ligament or tendon repair and can provide reproducible simple intraoperative location of intended attachment sites or tunnels. The shape orientation and position of the 3D guidance templates may be individualized and optimized for articular anatomy as well as the biomechanical situation and may incorporate not only the articular shape but also anatomic lines anatomic planes biomechanical lines or biomechanical planes as well as portions or all of the shape of devices or anchors or instruments to be implanted or to be used during implantation or to be used during surgical repair of a ligament or tendon tear.

3D guidance templates may also be utilized to treat impingement syndromes for example by template guided removal of osteophytes or exophytic bone growth. In one embodiment an imaging test such as a CT scan or an MRI scan is obtained through the area of concern. If a joint is imaged the images can demonstrate an osteophyte or more generally exophytic bone growth in intra and extra articular locations. The scan data may then be utilized to design a template having one or more anatomical relief surfaces that match substantially match overlay and or are recessed from the surface adjacent to the exophytic bone growth or osteophyte the surface overlying the exophytic bone growth or osteophyte or both or portions of one or both. The template may have openings or apertures or linkages that allow placement of surgical tools for removal of the exophytic bone growth or the osteophyte such as reamers drills rotating blades and the like. Someone skilled in the art will recognize many different surgical instruments that can be utilized in this manner.

Two representative examples where a 3D guidance template can be applied to treat local impingement syndromes are the pincer and Cam impingement syndromes in the hip joint. Pincer and Cam impingement represent femoro acetabular impingement syndromes caused by an abutment between the proximal femur and the acetabular rim during the end range of motion. Untreated femoral acetabular impingement can cause osteoarthritis of the hip.

In Cam impingement a non spherical portion of the femoral head typically located near the head neck junction is jammed into the acetabulum during hip joint motion. The Cam impingement can lead to considerable shear forces and subsequently chondral erosion.

In one embodiment an imaging test such as a CT scan or MRI scan may be performed pre operatively. The imaging test may be used to identify the non spherical portion of the femoral head at the head neck junction that is responsible for the impingement. A 3D guidance template may be designed that can be applied intraoperatively to this region. The template is designed to fulfill three principle functions 

1. Intraoperative highly accurate identification of the non spherical portion of the femoral head by placement of the individualized portion of the 3D template onto the area or immediately adjacent to the area.

2. Guidance of surgical instrumentation to remove the non spherical portion and to re establish a spherical or essentially spherical shape.

3. Control of the depth of the bone removal and the shape of the bone removal. For this purpose a stop may be incorporated into the design of the 3D guidance template. Of note the stop may be asymmetrical and can even be designed to be a mirror and or negative image of the desired articular contour.

In Pincer impingement linear bony contact occurs between the normal femoral head neck junction and enlarged or hypertrophied portion of the acetabulum. Pre operatively an imaging test may be performed in order to identify the abnormal over covered or enlarged area of the acetabulum. The amount of bone removal may be determined on the imaging study e.g. a CT scan or MRI scan. A 3D guidance template may then be designed that will achieve the identical three functions described above in Cam impingement.

Accurate and reproducible identification of the abnormal bony surface causing the impingement is critical in any form of musculoskeletal impingement syndrome. 3D guidance template systems are ideally suited to achieve this purpose and to guide the surgical instrumentation for removal of the source of impingement. Moreover since the localization of the impinging area is performed pre operatively during the imaging test and intra operatively using the 3D guidance template this approach allows for minimally invasive tissue specifically muscle sparing approaches.

3D guidance template technology as described herein may be combined with surgical navigation techniques. Surgical navigation techniques may be image guided or non image guided for this purpose. Passive or active surgical navigation systems may be employed. Surgical navigation systems that use optical or radiofrequency transmission or registration may be used. A representative example is the Vector Vision navigation system manufactured by Brain Lab Germany. This is a passive infrared navigation system. Once the patient is positioned appropriately in the operating room retro reflective markers can be applied to the extremity near the area of intended surgery. With image guided navigation an imaging study such as a CT scan or MRI scan can be transferred into the workstation of the navigation system. For registration purposes the surgeon can for example utilize a pointer navigation tool to touch four or more reference points that are simultaneously co identified and cross registered on the CT or MRI scan on the workstation. In the knee joint reference points may include the trochlear groove the most lateral point of the lateral condyle the most medial femoral condyle the tip of the tibial spines and so forth. Using image guided navigation anatomical and biomechanical axis of the joint can be determined reliably.

Alternatively non image guided navigation may be utilized. In this case retro reflective markers or small radio frequency transmitters are positioned on the extremity. Movement of the extremity and of the joints is utilized for example to identify the center of rotation. If surgery of the knee joint is contemplated the knee joint may be rotated around the femur. The marker or radiofrequency transmitter motion may be utilized to identify the center of the rotation which will coincide with the center of the femoral head. In this manner the biomechanical axis may be determined non invasively.

The information resulting in imaging guided navigation pertaining to either anatomical or biomechanical axis can be may be utilized to optimize the position of any molds blocks linkages or surgical instruments attached to or guided through the 3D guidance molds.

In one embodiment the joint or more specifically the articular surface may be scanned intra operatively for example using ultrasound or optical imaging methods. The optical imaging methods may include stereographic or stereographic like imaging approaches for example multiple light path stereographic imaging of the joint and the articular surface or even single light path 3D optical imaging. Other scan technologies that are applicable are for example C arm mounted fluoroscopic imaging systems that can optionally also be utilized to generate cross sectional images such as a CT scan. Intraoperative CT scanners are also applicable. Utilizing the intraoperative scan a point cloud of the joint or the articular surface or a 3D reconstruction or a 3D visualization and other 3D representations may be generated that can be utilized to generate an individualized template wherein at least a portion of said template includes a surface that is a mirror and or negative image of the joint or the articular surface. A rapid prototyping or a milling or other manufacturing machine can be available in or near the operating room and the 3D guidance template may be generated intraoperatively.

The intraoperative scan in conjunction with the rapid production of an individualized 3D guidance template matching the joint or the articular surface in whole or at least in part has the advantage to generate rapidly a tool for rapid intraoperative localization of anatomical landmarks including articular landmarks. A 3D guidance template may then optionally be cross registered for example using optical markers or radiofrequency transmitters attached to the template with the surgical navigation system. By cross referencing the 3D guidance template with the surgical navigation system surgical instruments can now be reproducibly positioned in relationship to the 3D guidance template to perform subsequent procedures in alignment with or in a defined relationship to at least one or more anatomical axis and or at least one or more biomechanical axis or planes.

In addition to cross sectional or volumetric imaging technologies including CT spiral CT and MRI stereoscopic imaging modalities may be utilized. Stereoscopic imaging is any technique capable of recording three dimensional information from two two dimensional projectional imaging. Traditional stereoscopic imaging includes creating a 3D visualization or representation starting from a pair of 2D images. The projection path of the 2D images is offset. The offset is for example designed to create an impression of object depth for the eyes of the viewer. The offset or minor deviation between the two images is similar to the prospectors that both eyes naturally receive inbinocular vision. Using two or more images with an offset or minor deviation in perspective it is possible to generate a point cloud or 3D surface or 3D visualization of a joint or an articular surface which can then be input into a manufacturing system such as a rapid prototyping or milling machine. Dual or more light path as well as single light path systems can be employed

When a total knee arthroplasty is contemplated the patient can undergo an imaging test as discussed in more detail above that will demonstrate the articular anatomy of a knee joint e.g. width of the femoral condyles the tibial plateau etc. Additionally other joints can be included in the imaging test thereby yielding information on femoral and tibial axes deformities such as varus and valgus and other articular alignment. The imaging test can be an x ray image including in a standing load bearing position a CT or spiral CT scan or an MRI scan or combinations thereof. A spiral CT scan may be advantageous over a standard CT scan due to its improved spatial resolution in z direction in addition to x and y resolution. The articular surface and shape as well as alignment information generated with the imaging test can be used to shape the surgical assistance device to select the surgical assistance device from a library of different devices with pre made shapes and sizes or can be entered into the surgical assistance device and can be used to define an optimal location and orientation of saw guides or drill holes or guides for reaming devices or other surgical instruments. Intraoperatively the surgical assistance device is applied to the tibial plateau and subsequently the femoral condyle s by matching its surface with the articular surface or by attaching it to anatomic reference points on the bone or cartilage. The surgeon can then introduce a reamer or saw through the guides and prepare the joint for the implantation. By cutting the cartilage and bone along anatomically defined planes a more reproducible placement of the implant can be achieved. This can ultimately result in improved postoperative results by optimizing biomechanical stresses applied to the implant and surrounding bone for the patient s anatomy and by minimizing axis malalignment of the implant. In addition the surgical assistance device can greatly reduce the number of surgical instruments needed for total or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Thus the use of one or more surgical assistance devices can help make joint arthroplasty more accurate improve postoperative results improve long term implant survival reduce cost by reducing the number of surgical instruments used. Moreover the use of one or more surgical assistance device can help lower the technical difficulty of the procedure and can help decrease operating room OR times.

Thus surgical tools described herein can also be designed and used to control drill alignment depth and width for example when preparing a site to receive an implant. For example the tools described herein which typically conform to the joint surface can provide for improved drill alignment and more accurate placement of any implant. An anatomically correct tool can be constructed by a number of methods and can be made of any material including a substantially translucent and or transparent material such as plastic Lucite silastic SLA or the like and typically is a block like shape prior to molding.

Turning now to a variety of illustrations are provided showing a tibial cutting block and mold system. illustrates the tibial cutting block in conjunction with a tibia that has not been resected. In this depiction the cutting block consists of at least two pieces. The first piece is a patient specific interior piece or mold that is designed on its inferior surface to mate or substantially mate with the existing geography of the patient s tibia . The superior surface and side surfaces of the first piece are configured to mate within the interior of an exterior piece . The reusable exterior piece fits over the interior piece . The system can be configured to hold the mold onto the bone.

The reusable exterior piece has a superior surface and an inferior surface that mates with the first piece . The reusable exterior piece includes cutting guides to assist the surgeon in performing the tibial surface cut described above. As shown herein a plurality of cutting guides can be provided to provide the surgeon a variety of locations to choose from in making the tibial cut. If necessary additional spacers can be provided that fit between the first patient configured or molded piece and the second reusable exterior piece or cutting block .

If desired the mold may be a single component or multiple components. In one embodiment one or more components are patient specific while other components such as spacers or connectors to surgical instruments are generic. In one embodiment the mold can rest on portions of the joint on the articular surface or external to the articular surface. Other surgical tools then may connect to the mold. For example a standard surgical cut block as described for standard implants for example in the knee the J J PFC Sigma system the Zimmer Nexgen system or the Stryker Duracon system can be connected or placed on the mold. In this manner the patient specific component can be minimized and can be made compatible with standard surgical instruments.

The mold may include receptacles for standard surgical instruments including alignment tools or guides. For example a tibial mold for use in knee surgery may have an extender or a receptacle or an opening to receive a tibial alignment rod. In this manner the position of the mold can be checked against the standard alignment tools and methods. Moreover the combined use of molds and standard alignment tools including also surgical navigation techniques can help improve the accuracy of or optimize component placement in joint arthroplasty such as hip or knee arthroplasty. For example the mold can help define the depth of a horizontal tibial cut for placement of a tibial component. A tibial alignment guide for example an extramedullary or intramedullary alignment guide used in conjunction with a tibial mold can help find the optimal anteroposterior angulation posterior slope tibial slant or varus valgus angle of the tibial cut. The mold may be designed to work in conjunction with traditional alignment tools known in the art.

The mold may include markers e.g. optoelectronic or radiofrequency for surgical navigation. The mold may have receptacles to which such markers can be attached either directly or via a linking member.

The molds can be used in combination with a surgical navigation system. They can be used to register the bones associated with a joint into the coordinate system of the surgical navigation system. For example if a mold for a joint surface includes tracking markers for surgical navigation the exact position and orientation of the bone can be detected by the surgical navigation system after placement of the mold in its unique position. This helps to avoid the time consuming process to acquire the coordinates of tens to hundreds of points on the joint surface for registration.

Referring back to the variable nature of the interior piece facilitates obtaining the most accurate cut despite the level of disease of the joint because it positions the exterior piece such that it can achieve a cut that is perpendicular to the mechanical axis. Either the interior piece or the exterior piece can be formed out of any suitable material. Additionally it should be understood that the various embodiments described herein may be of a single piece configuration as the two or more piece configuration described herein. The reusable exterior piece and the patient specific interior piece can be a single piece that is either patient specific where manufacturing costs of materials support such a product or is reusable based on a library of substantially defect conforming shapes developed in response to known or common tibial surface sizes and defects.

The interior piece is typically molded to the tibia including the subchondral bone and or the cartilage as well as including one or more anatomical relief surfaces not shown if desired. The surgeon will typically remove any residual meniscal tissue prior to applying the mold. Optionally the interior surface of the mold can include shape information of portions or all of the menisci.

Turning now to a variety of views of the removable exterior piece . The top surface of the exterior piece can be relatively flat. The lower surface which abuts the interior piece conforms to the shape of the upper surface of the interior piece. In this illustration the upper surface of the interior piece is flat therefore the lower surface of the reusable exterior surface is also flat to provide an optimal mating surface.

A guide plate is provided that extends along the side of at least a portion of the exterior piece . The guide plate provides one or more slots or guides through which a saw blade can be inserted to achieve the cut desired of the tibial surface. Additionally the slot or guide can be configured so that the saw blade cuts at a line perpendicular to the mechanical axis or so that it cuts at a line that is perpendicular to the mechanical axis but has a 4 7 slope in the sagittal plane to match the normal slope of the tibia.

Optionally a central bore can be provided that for example enables a drill to ream a hole into the bone for the stem of the tibial component of the knee implant.

As is evident from the views shown in the length of the guide plate can be such that it extends along all or part of the tibial plateau e.g. where the guide plate is asymmetrically positioned as shown in or symmetrically as in . If total knee arthroplasty is contemplated the length of the guide plate typically extends along all of the tibial plateau. If unicompartmental arthroplasty is contemplated the length of the guide plate typically extends along the length of the compartment that the surgeon will operate on. Similarly if total knee arthroplasty is contemplated the length of the molded interior piece typically extends along all of the tibial plateau it can include one or both tibial spines. If unicompartmental arthroplasty is contemplated the length of the molded interior piece typically extends along the length of the compartment that the surgeon will operate on it can optionally include a tibial spine.

Turning now to an alternative embodiment is depicted of the aperture . In this embodiment the aperture features lateral protrusions to accommodate using a reamer or punch to create an opening in the bone that accepts a stem having flanges.

As illustrated in the surface of the mold can be configured such that the upper surface forms a convex dome that fits within a concave well provided on the interior surface of the cutting block . This configuration enables greater rotational movement about the mechanical axis while limiting lateral movement or translation.

Other embodiments and configurations could be used to achieve these results without departing from the scope of the invention.

As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art more than two pieces can be used where appropriate to comprise the system. For example the patient specific interior piece can be two pieces that are configured to form a single piece when placed on the tibia. Additionally the exterior piece can be two components. The first component can have for example the cutting guide apertures . After the resection using the cutting guide aperture is made the exterior piece can be removed and a secondary exterior piece can be used which does not have the guide plate with the cutting guide apertures but has the aperture which facilitates boring into the tibial surface an aperture to receive a stem of the tibial component of the knee implant. Any of these designs could also feature the surface configurations shown in if desired.

Turning now to a femoral mold system is depicted that facilitates preparing the surface of the femur such that the finally implanted femoral implant will achieve optimal mechanical and anatomical axis alignment.

Turning now to the femur with a first portion of the cutting block placed on the femur and a second exterior portion placed over the first portion is illustrated. The second exterior portion features a series of rectangular grooves that facilitate inserting a saw blade therethrough to make the cuts necessary to achieve the femur shape illustrated in . These grooves can enable the blade to access at a 90 angle to the surface of the exterior portion or for example at a 45 angle. Other angles are also possible without departing from the scope of the invention.

As shown by the dashed lines the grooves of the second portion overlay the apertures of the first layer.

Similar to the designs discussed above with respect to alternative designs can be used to control the movement and rotation of the cutting block relative to the mold . As shown in a series of protrusions illustrated as pegs are provided that extend from the superior surface of the mold. These pegs or protrusions can be telescoping to facilitate the use of molds if necessary. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art one or more pegs or protrusions can be used without departing from the scope of the invention. For purposes of illustration two pegs have been shown in . Depending on the control desired the pegs are configured to fit within for example a curved slot that enables rotational adjustment similar to the slots illustrated in or within a recess that conforms in shape to the peg similar to that shown in and described with respect to the tibial cutting system. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art the recess can be sized to snugly encompass the peg or can be sized larger than the peg to allow limited lateral and rotational movement.

As illustrated in the surface of the mold can be configured such that the upper surface forms a convex dome that fits within a concave well provided on the interior surface of the cutting block . This configuration enables greater rotational movement about the mechanical axis while limiting lateral movement or translation.

In installing an implant first the tibial surface is cut using a tibial block such as those shown in . The patient specific mold is placed on the femur. The knee is then placed in extension and spacers such as those shown in or shims are used if required until the joint optimal function is achieved in both extension and flexion. The spacers or shims are typically of an incremental size e.g. 5 mm thick to provide increasing distance as the leg is placed in extension and flexion. A tensiometer can be used to assist in this determination or can be incorporated into the mold or spacers in order to provide optimal results. The design of tensiometers are known in the art and are not specifically described herein. Suitable designs include for example those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 630 820 to Todd issued May 20 1997.

As illustrated in sagittal view and O coronal view the interior surface of the mold can include small teeth or extensions that can help stabilize the mold against the cartilage or subchondral bone .

3D guidance templates may be used to create more that one cut on the same and or on the opposite articular surface or opposite articular bone in accordance with an embodiment. These cuts may be cross referenced with other cuts using one or more guidance template s .

In accordance with one embodiment the 3D guidance template s are utilized to perform more than one cut on the same articular side such as the femoral side of a knee joint. In another embodiment a 3D guidance template may be utilized to cross reference surgical interventions on an opposing articular surface. In a knee for example the first articular surface can be the femoral surface. The opposing articular surface can be the tibial surface or the patella surface. In a hip the first articular surface can be the acetabulum. The opposing articular surface or the opposing bone can be the proximal femur.

Thus in a knee a horizontal femur cut can be cross referenced with an anterior or posterior femur cut or optionally also chamfer oblique cuts. Similarly a tibial horizontal cut can be cross referenced with any tibial oblique or vertical cuts on the same articular side or surface.

In accordance with another embodiment one or more femur cuts can be crossed referenced with one or more tibial cuts. Or in a hip one or more acetabular cuts or surgical interventions can be cross referenced with one or more femoral cuts or surgical interventions such as drilling reaming or boring. Similarly in a knee again one or more femur cuts can be cross referenced with one or more patella cuts. Any combination and order is possible.

The cross referencing can occur via attachments or linkages including spacers or hinge or ratchet like devices from a first articular bone and or cartilage surface to a second articular bone and or cartilage surface. The resulting positioning of the cut on the opposing articular bone or cartilage surface can be optimized by testing the cut for multiple pose angles or joint positions such as flexion extension internal or external rotation abduction or adduction. Thus for example in a knee a distal femur cut can be performed with a mold. Via a linkage or an attachment a tibial template may be attached thereto or to the cut or other surgical intervention thus a cross reference can be related from the femoral cut to a tibial cut or other surgical intervention. Cross referencing from a first articular surface to a second articular surface via without limitation attachments or linkages to a template has the advantage of insuring an optimal alignment between the implant or other therapeutic device components of the first articular surface to that on a second articular surface. Moreover by cross referencing surgical interventions on a first articular surface to a second articular surface improved efficiencies and time savings can be obtained with the resulted surgical procedure.

Cross referencing the first the second and optionally a third or more articular surface such as in a knee joint may be performed with a single linkage or attachment or multiple linkages or attachments. A single pose angle or position of a joint or multiple pose angles or positions of a joint may be tested and optimized during the entire surgical intervention. Moreover any resulting surgical interventions on the opposite second articular surface bone or cartilage may be further optimized by optionally cross referencing to additional measurement tools such as standard alignment guides.

For example in a knee joint a 3D template may be utilized to perform one or more surgical interventions on the femoral side such as a femoral cut. This can then be utilized via a linkage an attachment or via indirect cross referencing directly onto the site of surgical intervention to guide a surgical intervention such as a cut of the tibial side. Prior to performing the surgical intervention on the tibial side a traditional tibial alignment guide with cross reference to the medial and lateral malleolus of the ankle turn may be used to optimize the position orientation and or depth and extent of the planned surgical intervention such as the cut. For example cross referencing to the femoral cut can aid in defining the relative superior inferior height of the tibial cut while cross referencing a tibial alignment guide can optionally be utilized to determine the slant of the cut in the interior posterior direction.

An exemplary system and methodology is now described in which a femoral template is used to make a cut on the femur which is then cross referenced to properly align a tibial template for making a cut on the tibial plateau. Initially an electronic image s of the leg is obtained using imaging techniques elaborated in above described embodiments. For example a pre operative CT scan of a patient s leg may be obtained to obtain electronic image data.

Image processing is then applied to the image data to derive without limitation relevant joint surfaces axis and or cut planes. Image processing techniques may include without limitation segmentation and propagation of point clouds.

Relevant biomechanical and or anatomical axis data may be obtained by identifying for example the central femoral head central knee joint and center of the distal tibia. The cutting planes may then be defined based on at least one of these axis. For example the tibial implant bearing surface may be defined as being perpendicular to the axis defined by the center of the tibial plateau and the center of the distal tibia as illustrated in the tibial implant s medial margin may project towards the femoral head as illustrated in and the anterior to posterior slope of the tibia may be approximated by the natural anatomical slope alternatively excessive tibial slope may be corrected .

The tibial and femoral templates and implants may be designed based at least in part on the derived joint surfaces axis and or cut planes. show isometric views of a femoral template and a tibial template respectively in accordance with an embodiment. The femoral template has an interior surface that in various embodiments conforms or substantially conforms with the anatomic surface bone and or cartilage of the femur . Furthermore the interior surface of the femoral template may extend a desired amount around the anatomical boney surfaces of the condyle to further ensure proper fixation. The interior surface of the tibial cutting block may conform or substantially conform to the surface bone and or cartilage of the tibia .

In an exemplary use the femoral template is placed on the femoral condyle for example when the knee is flexed. The femoral template may be fixed to the femoral condyle using without limitation anchoring screws drill pins inserted through drill bushing holes and . The position of holes and on the condyle may be the same used to anchor the final implant to the femur. In various embodiments the holes and may include metal inserts bushings to prevent degradation when drilling. Fixing the template to the femoral condyle advantageously prevents movement of the template during subsequent cutting or other surgical interventions thereby ensuring the accuracy of the resultant surgical cuts.

To assist in accurately positioning the femoral template a femoral guide reference tool may be attached to the femoral template as shown in . The femoral guide reference tool may without limitation attach to one of holes and . The femoral guide reference tool may reference off the tangential margin of the posterior condyle and aid for example in correct anterior posterior positioning of the femoral template .

Upon proper fixation of the femoral template to the femoral condyle a cut to the femoral condyle is made using cut guide surface or element . The cut guide surface or element may be integral to the femoral template or may be an attachment to the femoral template with the attachment made of a harder material than the femoral template . For example the cut guide surface or element may be a metal tab that slides onto the femoral template which may be made without limitation of a softer plastic material.

Upon making the femoral cut and removing the femoral template a sample implant template not the final implant is optionally positioned on the condyle as shown in in accordance with an embodiment. The sample implant template may be attached to the condyle by using without limitation anchoring screws drill pins inserted through the same holes used to anchor the final implant to the femur.

The sample implant template includes an attachment mechanism for attaching the tibial template thereby cross referencing the placement of the distal tibial cut with respect to the femoral cut implant s placement. The attachment mechanism may be without limitation a boss as shown in or other attachment mechanism known in the art such as a snap fit mechanism. Note that in alternative embodiments a sample implant template may not be required. For example the tibial template may attach directly to the femoral template . However in the subject embodiment the drill bushing features of the femoral template can interfere with the knee going into extension possibly preventing the tibial cut.

In illustrative embodiments the thickness of the sample implant template may not only include the thickness of the final femoral implant but may include an additional thickness that corresponds to a desired joint space between tibial and femoral implants. For example the additional thickness may advantageously provide a desired joint space identified for proper ligament balancing or for flexion extension rotation abduction adduction anteversion retroversion and other joint or bone positions and motion.

Thus the tibial template used on the tibia can be cross referenced to the femoral template femoral cut and or sample implant . Similarly in the hip femoral templates can be placed in reference to an acetabular mold or vice versa. In general when two or more articular surfaces will be repaired or replaced a template can be placed on one or more of them and surgical procedures including cutting drilling sawing or rasping can be performed on the other surface or other surfaces in reference to said first surface s .

In illustrative embodiments three dimensional guidance templates may be utilized to determine an optimized implant rotation. Examples are provided below with reference to the knee however it is to be understood that optimizing implant rotation may be applied other joints as well.

The optimal rotation of a femoral component or femoral implant for a uni compartmental patello femoral replacement or total knee replacement may be ascertained in a number of different ways. Implant rotation is typically defined using various anatomic axes or planes. These anatomic axes may include without limitation the transepicondylar axis the Whiteside line i.e. the trochlea anteroposterior axis which is typically perpendicular to at least one of the cuts and or the posterior condylar axis. Another approach for optimizing femoral component rotation is a so called balancing gap technique. With the balancing gap technique a femoral cut is made parallel to the tibia i.e. the tibia is cut first typically. Prior to performing the femoral cut the femoral cut plate is optimized so that the medial and lateral ligament and soft tissue tension are approximately equal.

By measuring the relevant anatomic axis or planes the optimal implant rotation may be determined. In various embodiments the measurement may be factored into the shape position or orientation of the 3D guidance template. Any resultant surgical interventions including cuts drilling or sawings are then made incorporating this measurement thereby achieving an optimal femoral component rotation.

Moreover in order to achieve an optimal balancing the rotation of the template may be changed so that the cuts are parallel to the tibial cut with substantially equal tension medially and laterally applied.

A 3D guidance template may also be utilized to optimize tibial component rotation for uni compartmental or total knee replacements in accordance with an embodiment. Tibial component rotation may be measured using a number of different approaches known in the art. In one example of a tibial component rotation measurement the anteroposterior axis of the tibia is determined. For a total knee replacement the tibial component can be placed so that the axis of the implant coincides with the medial one third of the tibial tuberosity. This approach works well when the tibia is symmetrical.

In another embodiment the symmetrical tibial component is placed as far as possible posterolateral and externally rotated so that the posteromedial corner of the tibial plateau is uncovered to an extent of between three 3 and five 5 millimeters.

The above examples are only representative of the different approaches that have been developed in the literature. Other various anatomic axis plane and area measurements may be performed in order to optimize implant rotation.

In illustrative embodiments these measurements may be factored into the design of a 3D guidance template and the position shape or orientation of the 3D guidance template may be optimized utilizing this information. Thus any subsequent surgical intervention such as cutting sawing and or drilling will result in an optimized implant rotation for example in the horizontal or in a near horizontal plane.

Turning now to a variety of illustrations are provided showing a patellar cutting block and mold system. illustrates the patellar cutting block in conjunction with a patella that has not been resected. In this depiction the cutting block can consist of only one piece or a plurality of pieces if desired. The inner surface is patient specific and designed to mate or substantially mate with the existing geography of the patient s patella . Small openings are present to accept the saw. The mold or block can have only one or multiple openings. The openings can be larger than the saw in order to allow for some rotation or other fine adjustments. is a view in the sagittal plane S. The quadriceps tendon and patellar tendon are shown.

The second reusable exterior piece or cutting block can have grooves and extensions designed to mate with surgical instruments such as a patellar clamp . The patellar clamp can have ring shaped graspers and locking mechanisms for example ratchet like . The opening in the grasper fits onto the extension of the second reusable exterior piece . Portions of a first portion of the handle of the grasper can be at an oblique angle relative to the second portion of the handle or curved not shown in order to facilitate insertion. Typically the portion of the grasper that will be facing towards the intra articular side will have an oblique or curved shaped thereby allowing a slightly smaller incision.

The variable nature of the interior piece facilitates obtaining the most accurate cut despite the level of disease of the joint because it positions the exterior piece in the desired plane. Either the interior piece or the exterior piece can be formed out of any of the materials discussed above in Section II or any other suitable material. Additionally it should be understood that that the various embodiments described herein may include one two or more piece configurations. The reusable exterior piece and the patient specific interior piece can be a single piece that is either patient specific where manufacturing costs of materials support such a product or is reusable based on a library of substantially defect conforming shapes developed in response to known or common tibial surface sizes and defects.

The interior piece is typically molded to the patella including the subchondral bone and or the cartilage.

From this determination an understanding of the amount of space needed to optimally balance the knee is determined and an appropriate number of spacers is then used in conjunction with the cutting block and mold to achieve the cutting surfaces and to prevent removal of too much bone. Where the cutting block has a thickness of for example 10 mm and each spacer has a thickness of 5 mm in preparing the knee for cuts two of the spacers would be removed when applying the cutting block to achieve the cutting planes identified as optimal during flexion and extension. Similar results can be achieved with ratchet or jack like designs interposed between the mold and the cut guide.

Turning now to a variety of views showing sample mold and cutting block systems for use in the hip joint are shown. illustrates femur with a mold and cutting block system placed to provide a cutting plane across the femoral neck to facilitate removal of the head of the femur and creation of a surface for the hip ball prosthesis.

Various steps may be performed in order to design and make 3D guidance templates for hip implants in accordance with an embodiment.

For example in an initial step a discrepancy in the length of the left leg and right leg may be determined for example in millimeters. Leg length discrepancy may be determined for example using standing x rays typically including the entire leg but also cross sectional imaging modalities such as CT or MRI.

A CT scout scan may be utilized to estimate leg length. Alternatively select image slices through the hip and ankle joint may be utilized to estimate leg length either using CT or MRI.

Pre operative planning is then performed using the image data. A first 3D guidance template is designed to rest on the femoral neck. shows an example of an intended site for placement of a femoral neck mold for total hip arthroplasty. A cut or saw plane integrated into this template can be derived. The position shape and orientation of the 3D guidance mold or jig or template may be determined on the basis of anatomical axis such as the femoral neck axis the biomechanical axis and or also any underlying leg length discrepancy . Specifically the superoinferior cut or saw guide height can be adapted to account for leg length discrepancy. For example if the left leg is five 5 millimeters shorter than the right leg then the cut height can be moved by five 5 millimeters to account for this difference. The femoral neck cut height ultimately determines the position of the femoral stem. Thus in this manner using this type of pre operative planning the femoral neck cut height can be optimized using a 3D guidance template.

In the acetabulum the position and orientation of the acetabular component or acetabular cup is also critical for the success of hip surgery. For example the lowest portion of the acetabular cup may be placed so that it is five 5 millimeters lateral to an anatomic landmark on a pelvic x ray coinciding with the inferior border of the radiographic tear drop. If the acetabular component is for example placed too far superiorly significant bone may be lost.

Placing the acetabular component using the 3D guidance template may include for example the following steps 

Step Two Determining the anterior rotation of the acetabulum and the desired rotation of the acetabular cup.

The template may be optionally designed to rest primarily on the margin of the acetabular fossa. In this manner it is possible to ream through the template.

For purposes of reaming the template may be fixed to the pelvis for example using metal spikes or K wires. The template may also have a grip for fixing it to the bone. Thus a surgeon may optionally press the template against the bone while a second surgeon will perform the reaming through the opening in the template. The grip or any stabilizers can extend laterally and optionally serve as tissue retractors keeping any potentially interfering soft tissue out of the surgical field. The template may also include stoppers to avoid over penetration of the reamer. These stoppers may be designed in the form of metal stops defining the deepest penetration area for the peripheral portion or other portions of the reamer. Optionally the template may also taper and decrease in inner radius thereby creating a stop once the reamer once the reaches the innermost portion of the template. Any stop known in the art can be used. The imaging test can be used to design or shape the mold in a manner that will help achieve the optimal reaming depth. The stops can be placed on the mold or reamer in reference to the imaging test in order to achieve the optional reaming depth.

A 3D guidance template may be utilized to optimize the anteversion of the acetabular cup. For example with the posteral lateral approach typically an anteversion of forty to forty five degrees is desired in both males and females. With an anterolateral approach zero degrees anteversion may be desired. Irrespective of the desired degree of anti version the shape orientation and or position of the template may be optimized to include the desired degree of anteversion.

Similarly on the femoral side the 3D guidance template may be optimized with regard to its shape orientation and position in order to account for neutral varus or valgus position of the femoral shaft. A 3D guidance template may also be utilized to optimize femoral shaft anteversion.

Thus after a first template has been utilized for performing the femoral neck cut and a second template has been utilized for performing the surgical intervention on the acetabular side a third template may optionally be utilized to be placed onto the femoral cut.

Optionally modular hip implant components may be utilized such as a modular stem. Such modular designs can be helpful in further optimizing the resultant femoral anteversion by selecting for example different stem shapes.

In another embodiment the surgeon may perform a femur first technique wherein a first cut is applied to the femur using a first 3D guidance mold. Optionally the broach in the cut femoral shaft may be left in place. Optionally a trial implant head may be applied to the broach. The trial implant head may be variable in radius and superoinferior diameter and may be utilized to determine the optimal soft tissue tension. Optionally the trial head may also be utilized to determine the acetabular cup position wherein said acetabular cup position is derived on the basis of the femoral cut. Thus the acetabular position can be optionally derived using the opposite articular surface. In a reverse acetabulum first technique the acetabulum can be prepared first and using soft tissue balancing techniques the femoral component can be placed in reference to the acetabular component. Optionally the femoral cut may even be placed intentionally too proximal and is subsequently optimized by measuring soft tissue tension utilizing various trial heads with the option to then change the height of the optimal femoral cut.

In an illustrative embodiment in order to make a guidance template reliably and reproducibly a portion of the joint is identified in a first step wherein said portion of the joint has not been altered by the arthritic process. In a second step the surface or a point cloud of said portion of the joint is derived and may optionally be used to derive a virtual 3D model and in a third step to generate a physical model as part of the guidance template. Using a portion of the joint that has not been altered by the arthritic process can advantageously improve the reproducibility and the accuracy of the resultant mold or jig or template.

The step of identifying said portion of the joint may be visual semiautomatic or fully automatic. Anatomic models may assist in the process. Anatomic reference standards may be utilized.

As known in the art various methods for image segmentation may be used to derive the point cloud or the surface. Suitable algorithms include for example but are not limited to snakes live wire thresholding active contours deformable models and the like. Artificial neural networks may be employed to improve the accuracy of the molds.

In another embodiment the current biomechanical axis may determined or estimated in a first step. In a second step the desired biomechanical axis is determined. In a third step adjustments for example via change in slot position or position for openings for saws and drills and the like may be made to alter the cut or drill position in order to correct the biomechanical axis in a fourth step. In a fifth step the position of the slot or openings for saws and drills and the like may be adjusted for ligament balancing and or for optimizing flexion and extension gap. This adjustment may be performed in the 3D model prior to the manufacturing process. Alternatively adjustments may be made intraoperatively for example via spacers or ratchet like devices or pins to allow for some degree of rotation.

In another embodiment at least a portion of the surface of the mold or jig or template is derived from a portion of the joint that is affected by the arthritic process. Optionally adjustment means can be performed for example via the software to simulate a normal shape. The difference between the actual shape and the adjusted shape can be utilized to optimize the position of the slots or openings in the mold or template or jig.

In one embodiment at least a portion of the surface of the mold or jig or template that is in contact with the joint may be derived from a portion of the joint that is affected by the arthritic process and a portion of the joint that has not been altered by the arthritic process. By spanning both normal and diseased portions of the joint the interface between normal and diseased portions of the joint is included in the surface of the mold. The interface between normal and diseased portions of the joint is typically characterized by a sudden change in contour or shape e.g. a reduction in cartilage thickness a change in subchondral bone contour a cyst or a bone spur. This change in joint contour or shape provides additional reference points for accurately placing the mold or jig or template. In addition this change in joint contour or shape provides also additional stabilization or fixation of the mold or jig or template on the surface of the joint in particular while performing surgical interventions such as cutting drilling or sawing.

In deriving and manufacturing various embodiments it may be advantageous to provide one or more anatomical relief surfaces or portions of varying degrees to the surgical tools and or implants disclosed herein. Where an implant or surgical tool incorporates a surface that substantially matches or conforms to one or more anatomical structures it may be desirable to avoid or specifically preclude certain areas of the matching conforming surface from contacting and or conforming matching to the underlying anatomy by offsetting subtracting or otherwise modifying sections of the surface portions adjacent to such areas. Specific instances where such anatomical relief could be particularly advantageous can include but are not limited to anatomical areas that are difficult to access difficult to denude clean debride or otherwise prepare areas that are incompatible with minimal access procedures and or other areas that are desirable to avoid for other surgical reasons.

Anatomical relief can be achieved during the construction or modification of the surface prior to any rapid prototyping or CNC or other manufacturing method of an instrument or an implant with patient adapted or patient specific features. Anatomic relief can also be achieved after manufacturing of such components for example by subtraction of physical material e.g. through some grinding CNC polishing heat air or laser abrasion or other methods known in the art or developed in the future for removing material. Similarly anatomical relief may be accomplished by additive manufacturing process that build up or otherwise alter conforming surfaces to the joint.

Anatomical relief surfaces can form part of or be encompassed by the conforming surface such that a perimeter of the anatomical relief surface is completely surrounded by the conforming surface. In other embodiments the anatomical relief surface may be partially surrounded by the conforming surface. In still other embodiments the anatomical relief surface may by separated from the conforming surface such as where the anatomical relief surface is on the periphery of the tool or implant and or on the joint facing externally facing and or articulating surfaces of the tool or implant.

Once the offset surface has been derived the inner surface and or anatomical model can be removed and or hidden and a surgical tool can be overlaid onto the offset surface as best seen in . One or more relevant portions of the surgical tool are then merged onto the offset surface as shown in . Once the surgical tool has been merged and modeled the model can be utilized to manufacture the surgical tool incorporating the desired anatomical relief or can be used to modify a pre existing tool or implant . In the embodiment shown in the surgical tool incorporates an anatomical relief or clearance zone that corresponds to a region adjacent to the trochlear groove of the femur which desirably reduces or obviates the need for complete removal of all structures and or soft tissues e.g. cartilage and or osteophytes within the groove and directly surrounding areas.

Derivation and use of the offset surface in this manner desirably provides substantially conforming and or matching surfaces for alignment and placement of surgical tools and implants but allowing clearance for areas of anatomical concern and or avoidance. In addition maintaining a desired minimal clearance allows avoidance of specific anatomy while for example optionally maintaining a minimal thickness of the tool material to ensure tool integrity. The disclosed procedure also provides a repeatable and easily identifiable method of identifying a region of interest and quickly and easily constructing an appropriate anatomical relief structure to accommodate some or all of the region.

In another embodiment an anatomic relief can be achieved by not including or excluding select regions of anatomy from an image segmentation or 2D or 3D rendering or reconstruction of a surface.

In another embodiment an anatomic relief can be obtained by editing one or more contours on the original native images e.g. CT MRI or ultrasound for example by moving an articular surface in a desired direction to achieve or simulate the anatomic relief.

In a further embodiment shown in a cross sectional view of a surgical tool depicts a sawtooth pattern reference surface having multiple anatomical relief surfaces . The tool incorporates a plurality of reference surfaces that can be designed to contact and or substantially conform to portions of the natural anatomy of the trochlear groove . The reference surfaces can be designed and or selected to contact the natural articular surface s damaged articular surface s and or subchondral bone surface s either or with or without articular cartilage removed or combinations thereof.

It should be understood that such anatomical reliefs may be utilized to accommodate anatomical variations in all joints including those of the knee shoulder hip vertebrae elbow ankle wrist etc. In addition the anatomical relief surfaces described herein would have equal utility for incorporation into various implants including partial or total joint replacement implants as well as surgical tools and or molds.

Also described herein are kits comprising one or more of the methods systems and or compositions described herein. In particular a kit can include one or more of the following instructions methods of obtaining electronic images systems or instructions for evaluating electronic images one or more computer means capable of analyzing or processing the electronic images and or one or more surgical tools for implanting an articular repair system. The kits can include other materials for example instructions reagents containers and or imaging aids e.g. films holders digitizers etc. .

The following examples are included to more fully illustrate the various disclosures herein. Additionally these examples describe various specific embodiments they are not meant to limit the scope thereof of the systems and methods described herein.

Areas of cartilage are imaged as described herein to detect areas of cartilage loss and or diseased cartilage. The margins and shape of the cartilage and subchondral bone adjacent to the diseased areas are determined. The thickness of the cartilage is determined. The size of the articular repair system is determined based on the above measurements. In particular the repair system is either selected based on best fit from a catalogue of existing pre made implants with a range of different sizes and curvatures or custom designed using CAD CAM technology. The library of existing shapes is typically on the order of about 30 sizes.

The implant is a chromium cobalt implant. The articular surface is polished and the external dimensions slightly greater than the area of diseased cartilage. The shape is adapted to achieve perfect or near perfect joint congruity utilizing shape information of surrounding cartilage and underlying subchondral bone. Other design features of the implant can include a slanted 60 to 70 degree angle interface to adjacent cartilage a broad based base component for depth control a press fit design of base component a porous coating of base component for ingrowth of bone and rigid stabilization a dual peg design for large defects implant stabilization also porous coated a single stabilizer strut with tapered four fin and step design for small focal defects also porous coated and a design applicable to femoral resurfacing convex external surface and tibial resurfacing concave external surface .

The articular repair systems are inserted using arthroscopic assistance. The device does not require the 15 to 30 cm incision utilized in unicompartmental and total knee arthroplasties. The procedure is performed under regional anesthesia typically epidural anesthesia. The surgeon can apply a tourniquet on the upper thigh of the patient to restrict the blood flow to the knee during the procedure. The leg is prepped and draped in sterile technique. A stylette is used to create two small 2 mm ports at the anteromedial and the anterolateral aspect of the joint using classical arthroscopic technique. The arthroscope is inserted via the lateral port. The arthroscopic instruments are inserted via the medial port. The cartilage defect is visualized using the arthroscope. A cartilage defect locator device is placed inside the diseased cartilage. The probe has a U shape with the first arm touching the center of the area of diseased cartilage inside the joint and the second arm of the U remaining outside the joint. The second arm of the U indicates the position of the cartilage relative to the skin. The surgeon marks the position of the cartilage defect on the skin. A 3 cm incision is created over the defect. Tissue retractors are inserted and the defect is visualized.

A translucent Lucite block matching the 3D shape of the adjacent cartilage and the cartilage defect is placed over the cartilage defect. For larger defects the Lucite block includes a lateral slot for insertion of a saw. The saw is inserted and a straight cut is made across the articular surface removing an area slightly larger than the diseased cartilage. The center of the Lucite block contains two drill holes with a 7.2 mm diameter. A 7.1 mm drill with drill guide controlling the depth of tissue penetration is inserted via the drill hole. Holes for the cylindrical pegs of the implant are created. The drill and the Lucite block are subsequently removed.

A plastic model trial implant of the mini repair system matching the outer dimensions of the implant is then inserted. The trial implant is utilized to confirm anatomic placement of the actual implant. If indicated the surgeon can make smaller adjustments at this point to improve the match e.g. slight expansion of the drill holes or adjustment of the cut plane.

The implant is then inserted with the pegs pointing into the drill holes. Anterior and posterior positions of the implant are color coded specifically the anterior peg is marked with a red color and a small letter A while the posterior peg has a green color and a small letter P . Similarly the medial aspect of the implant is color coded yellow and marked with a small letter M and the lateral aspect of the implant is marked with a small letter L . The Lucite block is then placed on the external surface of the implant and a plastic hammer is used to gently advance the pegs into the drill holes. The pegs are designed to achieve a press fit.

The same technique can be applied in the tibia. The implant has a concave articular surface matching the 3D shape of the tibial plateau. Immediate stabilization of the device can be achieved by combining it with bone cement if desired.

Anatomical relief features can be used to accommodate or otherwise address osteophytes subchondral voids residual normal or diseased cartilage or combinations thereof and other patient specific defects or abnormalities. In the case of osteophytes the osteophyte can be integrated into the shape of the bone or joint facing surface of the implant component or guide tool. are exemplary drawings of an end of a femur having an osteophyte . In the selection and or design of an implant component for a particular patient an image or model of the patient s bone that includes the osteophyte or other surface feature can be utilized as a model for creating designing and or selecting an implant and or surgical tool having one or more conforming surfaces. If desired the portion of the image having the surface feature may be modified transformed cross referenced smoothed and or enhanced which could be utilized to increase the imaging accuracy of the osteophyte and or account for inaccuracies or potential inaccuracies in detection and or modeling of the osteophyte s surface. In one embodiment as shown in an implant or surgical tool component can be selected and or designed to include a negative anatomical relief conforming to the shape of the osteophyte . In alternative embodiments the anatomical relief could be sized and or configured to accommodate more than the osteophyte i.e. the anatomical relief cavity could be larger than the osteophyte or could be shaped differently or filtered to accommodate more than the osteophyte . In certain embodiments the anatomical relief may contact part but not all of the osteophyte or other anatomical structure i.e. the anatomical relief may be oversized to encompass the entirety of the osteophyte with optionally some portion of the osteophyte touching a wall of the anatomical relief . In other embodiments the anatomical relief may encompass only a portion of the osteophyte or other anatomical structure such as where a portion of the anatomical structure lies within the anatomical relief and other portions of the anatomical structure extend outside of the anatomical relief.

As another example a tibial component can be designed either before or after virtual modification of various features of the tibial bone including surface features have been accomplished. In one embodiment the initial design and placement of the tibial tray and associated components can be planned and accomplished utilizing information directly taken from the patient s natural anatomy. In various other embodiments the design and placement of the tibial components can be planned and accomplished after virtual modification of various bone portions including the removal modification and or enhancement of one or more cut planes to accommodate the tibial implant as well as the virtual removal modification and or enhancement of various potentially interfering structures i.e. overhanging osteophytes etc. . Someone skilled in the art will readily recognize that this is readily achievable also with a procedure that is based on burring. Prior virtual removal modification enhancement and or filling of such structures can facilitate and improve the design planning and placement of tibial components and prevent anatomic distortion from significantly affecting the final design and placement of the tibial components. For example once one or more tibial cut planes has been virtually removed or once an implant bed has been designed for a burring procedure including a robotic procedure the size shape and rotation angle of a tibial implant component can be more accurately determined from the virtually cut surface as compared to determining the size shape and or tibial rotation angle of an implant from the natural tibial anatomy prior to such cuts. In a similar manner structures such as overhanging osteophytes can be virtually removed either alone or in addition to virtual removal of the tibial cut plane s modified such as for example by incorporating a cut plane in the osteophyte that forms an addition or extension to an existing cut plane on the bone with the tibial implant structure and placement i.e. tibial implant size shape and or tibial rotation etc. subsequently planned. Of course virtually any unusual and or undesirable anatomical features or deformity including but not limited to altered bone axes flattening potholes cysts scar tissue osteophytes tumors and or bone spurs may be similarly virtually removed modified modeled and or otherwise utilized in the implant and or surgical tool design and placement.

Similarly to address a subchondral void a selection and or design for the bone facing surface of an implant component can include a positive anatomical relief integrated into the shape of the bone facing surface of the implant component. are exemplary drawings of an end of a femur having a subchondral void . During development of an implant an image or model of the patient s bone that includes the void can be utilized in creating designing and or selecting an implant and or surgical tool surface that conforms to the shape of void as shown in . In various other embodiments the image may be virtually altered to include additional removal filling modification filtering smoothing and or enhancement of voids etc. including virtual removal of the void if desired. Moreover it may be desirous that the positive anatomical relief does not completely conform to the void such as where the implant might not practically be able to be inserted into the void. Therefore in certain embodiments the implant and or surgical tool may only partially protrude into a void in the bone. Optionally a surgical strategy and or one or more guide tools can be selected and or designed to reflect the correction and correspond to the implant component.

In addition to osteophytes and subchondral voids the methods surgical strategies guide tools and implant components described herein can be used to address various other patient specific joint defects or phenomena. In certain embodiments correction can include the virtual removal of tissue for example to address an articular defect to remove subchondral cysts and or to remove diseased or damaged tissue e.g. cartilage bone or other types of tissue such as osteochondritic tissue necrotic tissue and or torn tissue. In such embodiments the correction can include the virtual removal or other modification of the tissue image data e.g. the tissue corresponding to the defect cyst disease or damage and the bone facing surface of the implant component can be derived after the tissue has been virtually removed or modified. For example if bone is several eburnated it is feasible to add material to the bone virtually and then form or design an implant. In certain embodiments the implant and or surgical tool component can be selected and or designed to include a thickness or other anatomical features that substantially matches the positive and or negative or various combinations thereof of the surface features including any virtually removed or added tissues. Alternatively the modification can include optimizing additional functional or one or more other parameters of the joint. Optionally a surgical strategy and or one or more guide tools can be selected and or designed to reflect the correction and correspond to the implant component

In certain embodiments one or more additional models or sets of models of the patient s biological structure also can be generated and conveyed to the surgeon or clinician to show an additional presence or absence of one or more defects of interest one or more resection cuts one or more guide tools and or one or more implant components or any combination of these. illustrate models for one particular patient receiving a single compartment knee implant having both femoral and tibial implant components. depict two perspective views of a patient s distal femur and depict two images of the patient s proximal tibia with patient adapted guide tools shown in . In these figures anatomical defects or other surface structures which are osteophytes in this example are categorized and differentiated into two shades lighter and darker. The lighter colored osteophytes depict osteophytes that do not interfere with placement of a surgical guide tool or implant components. The darker shaded osteophytes depict osteophytes that are anticipated to interfere with placement of a surgical guide tool or implant component. Accordingly this embodiment includes the categorization of the osteophytes or other surface features to serve as a guide or reference to the surgeon or clinician in determining which if any osteophytes should be removed prior to placement of the guide tools or implant components and or which if any osteophytes should be accommodated using for example an anatomical relief during placement of either or both of the surgical guide tool or tools or implant components

In certain embodiments the reference points and or anatomical features of a patient can be can be processed using mathematical functions to derive virtual corrected features which may represent a restored ideal or desired feature from which a patient adapted implant component can be designed. For example one or more features such as surfaces or dimensions of a biological structure can be modeled altered added to changed deformed eliminated corrected and or otherwise manipulated collectively referred to herein as variation of an existing surface or structure within the joint . While it is described in the knee these embodiments can be applied to any joint or joint surface in the body e.g. a knee hip ankle foot toe shoulder elbow wrist hand and a spine or spinal joints.

Variation of the joint or portions of the joint can include without limitation variation of one or more external surfaces internal surfaces joint facing surfaces uncut surfaces cut surfaces altered surfaces and or partial surfaces as well as surface subsurface and or external features such as osteophytes subchondral cysts geodes or areas of eburnation joint flattening contour irregularity and loss of normal shape. The surface or structure can be or reflect any surface or structure in the joint including without limitation bone surfaces ridges plateaus cartilage surfaces ligament surfaces or other surfaces or structures. The surface or structure derived can be an approximation of a healthy joint surface or structure or can be another variation. The surface or structure can be made to include pathological alterations of the joint. The surface or structure also can be made whereby the pathological joint changes are virtually removed in whole or in part.

Computer software programs to generate models of patient specific renderings of implant assembly and defects e.g. osteophyte or other anatomical structures together with bone models to aid in surgery planning can be developed using various publicly available programming environments and languages for example Matlab 7.3 and Matlab Compiler 4.5 C or Java. In certain embodiments the computer software program can have a user interface that includes one or more of the components identified in . Alternatively one or more off the shelf applications can be used to generate the models such as SolidWorks Rhinoceros 3D Slicer or Amira.

An illustrative flow chart of the high level processes of an exemplary computer software program is shown in . Briefly a data path associated with one or more patient folders that include data files for example patient specific CT images solid models and segmentation images is selected. The data files associated with the data path can be checked for example using file filters to confirm that all data files are present. For example in generating models for a knee implant a data path can confirm the presence of one several or all coronal CT or MRI data files sagittal CT or MRI data files a femoral solid model data file a tibial solid model data file a femoral guide tool model a tibial guide tool model a femoral coronal segmentation model a femoral sagittal segmentation model a tibial coronal segmentation model and a tibial sagittal segmentation model. If the filter check identifies a missing file the user can be notified. In certain instances for example if a tibial or femoral guide tool model file is unavailable the user may elect to continue the process without certain steps for example without guide tool defect e.g. osteophyte or other surface feature interference analysis.

Next a patient specific cartilage or bone surface model is obtained and or rendered. The cartilage or bone surface model provides basic patient specific features of the patient s biological structure and serves as a reference for comparison against a model or value that includes the defect s and or surface features of interest. As an illustrative example previously generated patient specific files for example STL files exported from SOLID IGES files in SolidWorks can be loaded for example as triangulation points with sequence indices and normal vectors. The triangles then can be rendered e.g. using Matlab TRISURF function to supply or generate the cartilage or bone surface model. The cartilage or bone surface model can include defects and or other surface features such as osteophytes. If desired some or all of these surface features may selectively be analyzed assessed corrected filtered removed filled smoothed modified in shape or size or composition enhanced or otherwise manipulated and or cross referenced with other features in the same image or with similar features from other images. In this fashion one or more cartilage and or bone models implant models and or surgical tool models can be obtained and or rendered.

Next a patient specific model or values of the patient s biological feature that include the defect of interest or other surface features can be obtained rendered and or otherwise manipulated. For example patient specific surface features such as osteophytes can be identified from analysis of the patient s segmentation images and corresponding CT scan images. The transformation matrix of scanner coordinate space to image matrix space can be calculated from image slice positions e.g. the first and last image slice positions . Then patient specific segmentation images for the corresponding scan direction can be assessed along with CT image slices that correspond to the loaded segmentation images. Images can be processed slice by slice or as a volume and using selected threshold values e.g. intensity thresholds Hounsfield unit thresholds or neighboring pixel voxel value thresholds pixels and or voxels corresponding to the surface feature of interest e.g. osteophytes can be identified. The identified voxels can provide a binary cartilage or bone surface volume that includes the surface features of interest as part of the surface of the patient s biological structure. If desired various masks can be employed to mask out surface features that are not of interest for example an adjacent biological surface. In some instances masking can generate apparent unattached portions of an osteophyte defect or other surface feature for example when a mask covers a portion of an osteophyte extension.

Next the surface features of interest are isolated by comparing the model that does not include the defects of interest e.g. cartilage or bone surface model with the model or value that does include the surface features of interest e.g. the binary cartilage or bone surface volume . For example the triangulation points of the cartilage or bone surface model can be transformed onto an image volume space to obtain a binary representation of the model. This volume binary can be dilated and thinned to obtain a binary cartilage or bone model. The binary bone model then can serve as a mask to the binary cartilage or bone surface volume to identify surface feature volume separate from the binary cartilage or bone surface volume. For example for osteophyte detection the osteophyte volume e.g. osteophyte binary volume as well as the osteophyte position and attachment surface area can be distinguished from the patient s biological structure using this comparative analysis. Various thresholds and filters can be applied to remove noise and or enhance surface feature detection in this step. For example structures that have less than a minimum voxel volume e.g. less than 100 voxels can be removed. Alternatively or in addition rules can be added to reattach any portion of an osteophyte or other surface feature that appears unattached e.g. due to a masking step.

In an alternative approach surface data can be used instead of voxel or volume data when comparing the bone surface model with corrected surface features and the patient s actual bone surface. The bone surface model for example can be loaded as a mesh surface e.g. in an STL file or a parametric surface e.g. in an IGES file without conversion to volumetric voxel data. The patient s natural cartilage or bone surface can be derived from the medical image data e.g. CT data using for example a marching cubes or isosurface algorithm resulting in a second surface data set. The cartilage or bone surface model and the natural cartilage or bone surface can be compared for example by calculating intersection between the two surfaces.

In another alternative approach the 3D representation of the biological structure can be generated or manipulated for example smoothed or corrected for example by employing a 3D polygon or mesh surface a subdivision surface or parametric surface for example a non uniform rational B spline NURBS surface or an implicit surface. For a description of various parametric surface representations see for example Foley J. D. et al. Computer Graphics Principles and Practice in C Addison Wesley 2nd edition 1995 . Various methods are available for creating a parametric surface. For example the 3D representation can be generated directly as a parametric surface from image data of the biological structure for example CT or MR images by approximating the contours of the biological structure with the surface. Alternatively a parametric surface can be best fit to the 3D representation by connecting data points to create a surface of polygons and applying rules for polygon curvatures surface curvatures and other features or using publicly available software such as Geomagic software Research Triangle Park N.C. . Other possible 3D representations of the biological structure can be defined as implicit surfaces such as level sets isosurfaces or adaptive data structures. Alternatively the surface can be represented volumetrically or as a point cloud.

Next optionally the models can be used to detect interference between any surface feature volume and the placement of one or more guide tools and or implant components. For example guide tool model triangulation points can be transformed onto an image volume space to obtain a binary representation of the guide tool. The binary structure then can be manipulated e.g. dilated and eroded using voxel balls having pre set diameters to obtain a solid field mask. The solid field mask can be compared against the surface feature volume for example the osteophyte binary volume to identify interfering surface feature volume for example interfering osteophyte binary volume. In this way interfering surface feature volume and non interfering surface feature volume can be determined e.g. using Matlab ISOSURFACE function for example using representative colors or some other distinguishing features in a model. The resulting model image can be rendered on a virtual rendering canvas e.g. using Matlab GETFRAME function and saved onto a computer readable medium.

Finally optionally as exemplified by one or more combinations of model features can be combined into one or models or sets of models that convey desired information to the surgeon or clinician. For example patient specific cartilage or bone models can be combined with any number of surface features and or surface feature types any number of resection cuts any number of drill holes any number of axes any number of guide tools and or any number of implant components to convey as much information as desired to the surgeon or clinician. The patient specific cartilage or bone model can model any biological structure for example any one or more or portion of a femoral head and or an acetabulum a distal femur one or both femoral condyle s and or a tibial plateau a trochlea and or a patella a glenoid and or a humeral head a talar dome and or a tibial plafond a distal humerus a radial head and or an ulna and a radius and or a scaphoid. Surface features that can be combined with a patient specific cartilage or bone model can include for example osteophytes voids subchondral cysts articular shape defects e.g. rounded or flattened articular surfaces or surface portions varus or valgus deformities or any other deformities or other surface or subsurface or external i.e. non surface or subsurface features known to those in the art.

The models can include virtual corrections and or modifications reflecting a surgical plan such as one or more removed or modified surface features such as osteophytes cut planes drill holes realignments of mechanical or anatomical axes. The models can include comparison views demonstrating the anatomical situation before and after applying the planned correction. The individual steps of the surgical plan can also be illustrated in a series of step by step images wherein each image shows a different step of the surgical procedure.

The models can be presented to the surgeon as a printed or digital set of images. In another embodiment the models are transmitted to the surgeon as a digital file which the surgeon can display on a local computer. The digital file can contain image renderings of the models. Alternatively the models can be displayed in an animation or video. The models can also be presented as a 3D model that is interactively rendered on the surgeon s computer. The models can for example be rotated to be viewed from different angles. Different components of the models such as cartilage or bone surfaces surface features and or defects resection cuts axes guide tools or implants can be turned on and off collectively or individually to illustrate or simulate the individual patient s surgical plan. The 3D model can be transmitted to the surgeon in a variety of formats for example in Adobe 3D PDF or as a SolidWorks eDrawing.

Implant and or surgical tool selection design and modeling can also incorporate external anatomical relief surfaces to facilitate surgical procedures and implants that are ligament sparing as well as for other soft and or hard tissues forming part of or adjacent to the treated anatomical structures. For example with regard to the PCL and or the ACL an imaging test can be utilized to identify for example the origin and or the insertion of the PCL and the ACL on the femur and tibia. The origin and the insertion can be identified by visualizing for example the ligaments directly as is possible with MRI or spiral CT arthrography or by visualizing bony landmarks known to be the origin or insertion of the ligament such as the medial and lateral tibial spines. Such structures can be subsequently modeled on a suitable computing system or imaged directly from the structures or a combination thereof.

An implant system and or surgical tool can then be selected or designed based on the image data so that for example the femoral component preserves the ACL and or PCL origin and the tibial component preserves the ACL and or PCL attachment. The implant can be selected or designed so that bone cuts adjacent to the ACL or PCL attachment or origin do not weaken the bone to induce a potential fracture. If desired a motion study or other three dimensional analysis can be conducted to determine if portions of the implant will directly or indirectly contact or otherwise influence i.e. force other structures into contact with surrounding soft or hard tissue structures. Similar studies can analyze the implant and or surrounding hard or soft tissues to determine what if any effects the implant will have on the surrounding tissues including through the effect of the surgical procedure e.g. cutting drilling burring depth of cut etc.

For ACL preservation the implant can have two unicompartmental tibial components that can be selected or designed and placed using the image data. Alternatively the implant can have an anterior bridge component. The width of the anterior bridge in AP dimension its thickness in the superoinferior dimension or its length in mediolateral dimension can be selected or designed using the imaging data and specifically the known insertion of the ACL and or PCL.

As can be seen in the posterior or any margin of an implant component e.g. a polyethylene or metal backed tray with polyethylene inserts can be selected and or designed using the imaging data or shapes derived from the imaging data so that the implant component includes one or more external anatomical relief surfaces that desirably will not interfere with and stay clear of the PCL or other tendons such as the popliteus tendon. This can be achieved for example by including external anatomical relief surfaces comprising one or more concavities or removal of other structures in the outline of the implant that are specifically designed or selected or adapted to avoid the ligament insertion. In various other embodiments an implant can include an external anatomical relief surface comprising one or more projections or other surfaces that contact guide or otherwise influence other tissues in some manner to prevent unwanted contact or other interaction with other portions of the implant e.g. a projection could act as a guide or other feature to prevent a tendon or other structure from being pinched and or severed by interacting articulating surfaces of the implant and or other surfaces of the implant and or natural joint. Such external anatomical relief surfaces could prevent structures from contacting moving portions of the implant as well as prevent the structures from moving into contact with surfaces that could sever abrade and or otherwise damage or injure the structures either quickly or after long term repetitive contact .

If desired and or as necessary any implant component can be selected and or adapted to include external anatomical relief surfaces that desirably stay clear of important ligament structures. Imaging data can help identify or derive shape or location information on such ligamentous structures. For example the lateral femoral condyle of a unicompartmental bicompartmental or total knee system can include a concavity or divot to avoid the popliteus tendon. Imaging data can be used to design a tibial component all polyethylene or other plastic material or metal backed that avoids the attachment of the anterior and or posterior cruciate ligament specifically the contour of the implant can be shaped so that it will stay clear of these ligamentous structures. A safety margin e.g. 2 mm or 3 mm or 5 mm or 7 mm or 10 mm can be applied to the design of the edge of the component to allow the surgeon more intraoperative flexibility. In a shoulder the glenoid component can include one or more external anatomical relief surfaces such as concavities or divots to avoid a subscapularis tendon or a biceps tendon or other tendons. In a hip the femoral component can include an external anatomical relief surface selected or designed to avoid an iliopsoas or adductor tendon or other tendons.

With regards to a tibial tray component various embodiments could include external anatomical relief surface features to avoid undesirable contact with surrounding ligaments and or tendons include 1 depth of dish optionally adapted to presence or absence of intact anterior and or posterior cruciate ligaments and 2 depth of trough optionally adapted to presence or absence of intact anterior and or posterior cruciate ligaments.

Additional tibial tray designs could include features to avoid additional soft tissue structures including those disclosed in . For example depicts a tibial tray and insert having an undesirable medial lateral width that results in contact with the medial collateral ligament MCL on one side and the lateral collateral ligament LCL on the other side of the tray insert. If desired the tray and or insert could include one or more indentations or voids not shown on one or more sides that accommodate the MCL and or LCL ligaments allowing the knee to flex and extend without undue contact and or wear of the ligaments along the sides of the tray and or insert.

Alternatively or in combination with one or more anatomical relief surfaces indentations and or voids the tray and or insert can incorporate one or more shape s that accommodate the various ligaments of the knee and desirably avoid and or reduce undesirable contact with such ligamentous structures to include designs such as shown in dotted lines in as well as the design shown in D.

Where the patient specific imaging information has been collected using x rays and or CT scans or the like or where artifacts are adjacent to or in the line of sight of areas being imaged it is often difficult if not impossible to visualize the articular cartilage and other soft tissues which potentially results in an unknown depth of cartilage during the surgical procedure. In this embodiment the subchondral bone contact surfaces comprise an adjustable screw arrangement or other adjustable mechanism which can be advance and or retracted as desired to account for varying thickness of articular cartilage and or accommodate other variations or unknown quantities regarding the anatomical surfaces. One or more such screws or adjustment mechanisms can be advanced to equal depths or can be asymmetric lengths as desired by the surgeon. Optionally the screws can be printed during the generation of the disposable jig with a 3D printing process. In various alternative embodiments the patient specific surgical tool can be designed to contain portions that rest on cartilage other portions that rest on bone subchondral cortical trabecular and or various anatomical relief surfaces as described herein . For example a tool may rest on the articular cartilage of a femoral condyle and also curve around the condylar edges to contact bone. The surgical tool can also include anatomical relief surfaces that rest on or otherwise contact or accommodate areas that include osteophytes or that otherwise avoid contact with various portions of the underlying anatomical surfaces.

In various embodiments the patient s anatomical information for the surgical tools may be derived using different 2D or 3D imaging techniques. Since some imaging techniques do not display soft tissue cartilage surface information may be estimated by offsetting the underlying bone surface by the expected cartilage thickness. If a surgical tool is designed to rest on cartilage and on bone anatomical relief surfaces i.e. offset surfaces and non offset surfaces may desirably be combined to design the patient specific tool. This can be achieved by calculating smooth transitions between portions of offset and non offset surfaces. Alternatively an offset surface may be used to trim a non offset surface or vice versa.

If desired one or more sets of jigs can be designed to include anatomical relief surfaces that desirably facilitate and or accommodate surgical procedures on bones and joint other than the knee. Desirably the surgical tools jigs are designed in connection with the design of a patient specific implant component. The designed jigs guide the surgeon in performing one or more patient specific cuts to the bone so that those cut bone surface s negatively match the patient specific bone cuts of the implant component.
