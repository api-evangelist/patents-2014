Wireless network resources are deployed for public safety applications. First responders and other public safety individuals users can be equipped with a mobile device that is configured to communicate with public safety networks as well as other networks such as commercial networks private networks etc. . There are numerous questions associated with mobile device usage on the public safety networks and or the commercial networks private networks etc. For example how might a public safety mobile device be homed on a national or regional agency network and roam to another network with minimal hardware impact How might a public safety mobile device be homed on a national or regional agency network and on another network dual home device simultaneously without roaming or without substantial device or network impacts How device policy might be enabled and deployed to facilitate changing from for example private to non private bands For example device policy scope can include Quality of Service QoS security application usage device management etc.

When a mobile device migrates to a different network or a different agency in the same network such as when a user is collaborating in a mutual aid or disaster scenario access to new or updated applications apps may be required. This can include an associated upload and or configuration of that user s mobile device to use the new applications new security credentials for those apps in the back end or there may be a need to collaborate with a different workgroup or set of individuals or interoperate with specific Land Mobile Radio LMR talk groups then during normal operations.

Today a device would require user or administrator driven provisioning change for a fully interoperable environment. There is a need to do this in a dynamic and automated way. It is envisioned in a national or regional agency environment that there may be three distinct points of control for a device image national agency jurisdictional and local incident related. In the local case an incident commander may be making application and configuration choices in real time that he she wants to distribute to the target responder group instantly without going up the national or agency level governance chain.

Thus there is a need to correlate profile changes across devices including bring your own device BYOD and across operating systems OSs . Today s process is prone to human error significant delay and complexity when time and reliability are critical for users.

Accordingly there is a need for a method and apparatus to manage user device profiles dynamically in public safety applications or the like.

Skilled artisans will appreciate that elements in the figures are illustrated for simplicity and clarity and have not necessarily been drawn to scale. For example the dimensions of some of the elements in the figures may be exaggerated relative to other elements to help to improve understanding of embodiments of the present invention.

The apparatus and method components have been represented where appropriate by conventional symbols in the drawings showing only those specific details that are pertinent to understanding the embodiments of the present invention so as not to obscure the disclosure with details that will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the description herein.

In an exemplary embodiment a method for managing user and device profiles for response to one or more incidents includes monitoring inputs related to one or more networks a plurality of devices and the one or more incidents determining application requirements and profile configurations for the plurality of devices based on the inputs from the one or more networks and the one or more incidents and for each of the plurality of devices providing applications based on the application requirements if required and providing the profile configurations for operation on the one or more networks during the one or more incidents.

In another exemplary embodiment a profile manager for managing user and device profiles for response to one or more incidents includes a network interface communicatively coupled to one or more networks a processor communicatively coupled to the network interface and memory storing computer executable instructions and in response to execution by the processor the computer executable instructions cause the processor to monitor inputs related to the one or more networks a plurality of devices and the one or more incidents determine application requirements and profile configurations for the plurality of devices based on the inputs from the one or more networks and the one or more incidents and for each of the plurality of devices provide applications based on the application requirements if required and provide the profile configurations for operation on one or more networks during one or more incidents.

In a further exemplary embodiment a mobile device configured with a profile manager for managing user and device profiles for response to one or more incidents the mobile device operated by an incident commander at the one or more incidents includes one or more radios communicatively coupled to one or more networks a processor communicatively coupled to the one or more radios and memory storing computer executable instructions and in response to execution by the processor the computer executable instructions cause the processor to detect one or more new agency devices and or non incident agency devices at the one or more incidents wherein the one or more new agency devices and or non incident agency devices do not have access to applications or profiles to communicate with incident agency devices at the one or more incidents determine application requirements and profile configurations for the one or more new agency devices and or non incident agency devices and for each of the new agency devices and or one or more non incident agency devices provide applications based on the application requirements if required and provide the profile configurations for operation with the incident agency devices during the one or more incidents.

In various exemplary embodiments a profile manager is described to dynamically assign implement manage and update profiles of users i.e. users mobile devices based on multiple incidents and network performance wherein the profiles of the users include an application and or security profiles of the user. The users can belong to an incident agency or a non incident agency who provides mutual aid to incident agency user first responder. The profile manager may reside in one or more Device Management Systems in one or more regions or agencies or the profile manager may reside on a device itself. The profile manager assigns or updates profiles of the users based on various incident triggers which include incident status job role user changes agency group affiliates etc. Based on the aforementioned inputs the profile manger creates application and or a security profile for users corresponding to the type of the incidents. Further the profile manager performs application and security compatibility for users corresponding to the various incidents to ensure interoperable communications and data sharing across the group of users. The profile manager provisions a list of such profiles in the users device for defining incident scenarios and switches the profiles in the users devices based on incident scenarios.

Further the profile assignment and updates for agency and or regional devices by the profile manager can be initiated by a computer aided dispatcher CAD or the devices itself. When an incident agency i.e. an agency for example a public safety agency such as police fire or other type of emergency responder in whose jurisdiction an incident occurred requires resources e.g. additional emergency responders from outside of the incident agency a non incident agency i.e. another agency for example another public safety agency whose jurisdiction may overlap with or be outside of the jurisdiction of the incident agency CAD can provide the resources and related data to a CAD of the incident agency. Additionally when resources outside of a geographical region of the incident agency are required the incident agency CAD may make a request to a regional or national entity to coordinate the inter working of the non incident agencies. The incident agency CAD can forward the data to the profile manager and the profile manager can create and update profiles for non incident agency devices responding to the incident and notify the incident agency CAD of these new and or updated profiles. Further the incident agency CAD can notify the non incident agency CAD of the incident and the non incident agency CAD can authorize the profile manager to inter work with the non incident agencies devices and to update the profiles of the non incident agency devices. Once the incident is over the non incident agency can notify the profile manager of this and the profile manager can restore the default profile of the non incident agency devices. Also when a new device of the incident agency referred to herein as a new agency device i.e. an incident agency device newly responding to an incident as opposed to an incident agency that is already at the incident or a non incident agency device from another jurisdiction comes into the vicinity of an incident agency device i.e. a device of the incident agency that has already responded to the incident a profile manager of the new agency device or the non incident agency device may request the profile manager of the incident agency device for a profile update in order to access necessary applications i.e. applications that the new agency non incident agency device will need to use in responding to the incident . The profile manager of the incident agency device then may communicate with a security profile database enable authentication and arrange for an update of a profile of the new agency device or non incident agency device. Further the incident agency CAD is notified of the new agency non incident agency device s profile.

Note the categorization of an incident and correspondingly profiles into Tier or is presented for illustration purposes and those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate other categorizations are contemplated. The incident agency CAD can be configured to provide an incident trigger incident type resource types etc. to the profile manager which trigger triggers a downloading of an appropriate profile Tier or to responders to the incident. In various embodiments a Tier profile may include must have applications and network application access that are specific to specific job roles and or incident types a Tier profile may include applications and network application access that are more generally incident and business essential and a Tier may include applications and network application access that are non incident and non business essential.

The data stores may include a policy database for each of the one or more networks accessible by the profile manager . In an exemplary embodiment the network may be a public safety network such as a regional or national network and the network may be a commercial network such as a cellular e.g. LTE or Wi Fi network that may be operated by a local regional or national service provider. Each policy database may include policy definitions of the tiers job roles incident types e.g. emergency high normal etc. and associated applications e.g. Short Message Service SMS Voice over Long Term Evolution LTE real time streaming video CAD etc. .

The profile manager is configured to change the profiles on the mobile devices based upon an incident or multiple incidents that is to determine and download to the users mobile devices a temporary profile that will allow the users devices to perform their requisite tasks and inter operate with each other and one or more responding agencies e.g. the incident agency and or any agency asserting control over the responders at the incident. That is based on a given incident s the profile manager is configured to change the user or device profiles in order to provide applications required for responding to the incident i.e. determining the application requirements to define configurations e.g. groups user lists security codec group scan appropriate for the incident s and to manage a priority of the users responding to and the applications utilized at the incident s . This temporary profile can become the defined incident profile s for incident s . In the determination of such profiles the profile manager may consider network status and may determine the priority of applications to load for users of the networks and that they can have access to utilizing the network performance and user priority to provide for optimized applications prioritization and network preferences. With the profile manager application and security profile compatibility is assured despite disparate mobile devices from different agencies. The profile manager can check existing user device profiles and load only what is needed to avoid incompatibilities and to assure interoperability across devices and OSs.

The profile manager process also determines an incident type or tier steps . For example the profile manager may categorize the incident in one or three Tiers that is Tiers and The profile manager process also determines an incident contact list steps . The incident type and incident contact list can be provided to the profile manager by the incident agency CAD or the like for example automatically upon a reporting of an incident or in response to a request from the profile manager.

The profile manager process also determines a profile setup in association with the determined incident type or tier steps . That is each incident type has an associated setup profile . For example the setup profile for Tier can include step 

Again these are presented for illustration purposes and other embodiments are also contemplated. The profile manager is configured to provision a list of profiles in the mobile devices per predefined incident scenarios and to dynamically switch the profiles configured in the mobile devices when deemed appropriate by the profile manager . Thus the profile manager includes determining application requirements for the incident s .

Subsequent to determining a profile setup in association with the determined incident type or tier the profile manager process aggregates all incident resource requirements step such as the applications required the number and or type of responders required and the bandwidth required. The profile manager process further may concurrently and continually monitor the inputs for updates. The inputs can be considered triggers that can cause dynamic updates of the profiles through the profile manager and based on continuous monitoring of the incident. For example profile updates may be triggered by a change in an incident status or a job role a user changing his or her mobile device a change in an agency group affiliation etc. The profile manager as described herein also is configured to dynamically create an application and security profile for various mobile devices based on the inputs for groups of users across multiple incidents.

The profile manager process after aggregating all of the incident resource requirements determines if any new incidents have occurred step . These are incidents that affect usage on any of the networks . If there have been any new incidents step then the profile manager process determines how many of the new incidents are in the given incident area step checks what application s are required for all such incidents step and returns to the steps .

If the profile manager process has accommodated all of the incidents in the given incident area step the profile manager process determines which incident mobile devices are app capable according to the appropriate setup profile step and determines which non incident mobile devices are available and app capable step . The incident mobile devices are incident agency issued devices and may include the profile manager client operating thereon. The new agency devices and or non incident mobile devices may be bring your own device BYOD devices or personal devices associated with users at the incident. If some of the mobile devices are not app capable steps then the profile manager process may adjust the apps supported by the mobile devices in the area step . In such an event the profile manager can cause an adjustment of the apps residing on a mobile device or can cause a download and installation of a new app on the mobile device. The profile manager causes applications to be delivered to the mobile devices if required based on application requirements for the incident. If the mobile devices are app capable steps the profile manager process is continued in connector .

In the profile manager process checks if a highest priority that is a priority 1 P1 network is available at the incident scene and has the required resources for a duration of the incident step . If a P1 network e.g. network is available and has the requisite resources the profile manager process allocates the responders incident agency and non incident agency to the P1 network and sends an appropriate profile i.e. a profile appropriate for the incident and for operating in the P1 network to the responders mobile devices step . For example the P1 network can be a public safety network. After allocating the responders to the P1 network the profile manager process can include monitoring for dynamic changes in incident severity network utilization resources and applications required step by returning to through connector .

If not enough resources are available at the P1 network step to support all incident responders the profile manager process checks if the P1 network resources are sufficient to support only the highest priority that is priority 1 P1 responders and whether the P1 responders are on the P1 network step . If there are enough resources available at the P1 network to support the P1 responders the profile manager process preempts lower priority users that is priority 2 P2 users and other lower priority users step and moves them to a next lower priority that is a priority 2 P2 network e.g. network . Further the profile manager process returns to step that is allocates the P1 responders to the P1 network if they are not yet on the P1 network and sends an appropriate profile to each of the P1 responders mobile devices . Further the profile manager process determines to allocate any new incident users to the P2 network step and checks if the P2 network is available with required resources for an incident duration step .

If the P2 network is available step the profile manager process allocates the non P1 responders to the P2 network and sends the appropriate profile to the responders mobile devices step . After allocating the non P1 responders to the P2 network the profile manager process can include monitoring for dynamic changes in incident severity network utilization resources and applications required step by returning to through the connector .

If there are not enough P2 network resources for the non P1 responders step the profile manager process checks if only P2 users are supported on the P2 network step and if not the priority 3 P3 and lower priority users are preempted and are moved to a yet next lower priority that is a priority 3 P3 network step . Further the profile manager process and returns to step that is allocates the P2 responders to the P2 network if they are not yet on the P2 network and sends an appropriate profile to each of the P2 responders mobile devices . Further the profile manager process determines to allocate any new incident users to the P3 network step . The profile manager process then checks if the P3 network is available with required resources for the incident duration step . If the P3 network is available with the required resources step the profile manager process allocates the remaining responders to the P3 network and sends an appropriate profile to the responders mobile devices step . After allocating the remaining responders to the P3 network the profile manager process may continue monitoring for dynamic changes in incident severity network utilization resources and applications required step by returning to through the connector .

If the P3 network does not have enough resources step the profile manager process may check if a peer to peer P2P capability is available at the incident scene step . For example the P2P capabilities can include IEE 802.11 and variants thereof or any other Wireless Local Area Network WLAN technique. If so the profile manager process may set up a P2P configuration step and enabling a P2P profile scheme step and if not and after the step the profile manager process can return to through the connector .

Note in the steps the profile manager process includes providing profile configurations to the mobile devices . The profile configurations determine which of the networks or other networks the mobile devices are assigned to their priority their security application permissions group memberships and the like. Note these profile configurations can be viewed as temporary profiles during the incident s and at the conclusion of the incident the mobile devices can return to the original profile configurations associated therewith. For example the inputs related to the networks can determine network assignments for available network bandwidth based on the application requirements.

Note the profile manager process is described above generally and there can be a plurality of users and each can be segmented as appropriate between the P1 P2 P3 and P2P networks based on priority tier available resources etc. Further this process can be dynamic based on the inputs over time. With the profile manager process the mobile devices can be automatically configured for their profile and applications to ensure reliable communications at the incident. With the profile manager process the profile manager can assess network bandwidth across the P1 P2 and P3 networks continuously monitor assess applications and QoS and optimize network usage via the device profiles via a Tier strategy. Preferably the managing of user profiles is tiered according to network utilization and application needs.

The profile manager is configured to dynamically implement manage and change applications user allocations and security profiles across multiple networks and or operating systems OSs same or disparate depending on the needs of current client usage multiple incident needs and network utilization. The profile manager gets the inputs regarding network utilization and network availability for each of multiple networks from a corresponding NMS and or a mobile device being served by the network. As described herein the profile manager may get the inputs of the incident details e.g. incident type incident severity number of responders required incident duration incident rate of change common security level required from the incident agency CAD or a 911 call center or any other incident management system. The profile manager takes the inputs defines a network preference list e.g. the network is a first priority P1 network and the network is a second priority P2 network and selects which network and profile and or application to utilize for a given device or group of devices. Further the profile manager continuously monitors the specified inputs dynamically sends updates for change of networks and updates profiles to be utilized.

The profile manager executes the various processes described herein by taking the inputs and determining required applications and application configuration parameters based on the inputs . The profile manager determines an incident agency contact list and the groups e.g. Push to Talk PTT Push to Video PTV or push to multi media to append to new agency devices and or existing non incident agency devices. The profile manager takes existing profiles in a profile database for device users and updates profiles or creates an instance of the profile for this incident and notifies a user controlling entity e.g. DM that profiles are ready.

The profile manager can determine the highest level of an interoperable security profile supported by available mobile devices for the incident. This common interoperable security profile is then sent to the incident group that is the mobile devices responding to the incident. The profile manager can perform the profile modification for a specified period of time or a specified condition after which the profile is restored to its original state. The profile manager takes existing profiles maintained in the profile database for users and or their mobile device and creates and or updates these profiles for device IDs and affiliates with User IDs. These profiles can be configured on their corresponding mobile devices to enable peer to peer P2P execution and direct communication of profile manager information.

The profile manager determines which mobile devices to update based on application and device capabilities. The profile manager executes the various processes described herein by taking the inputs and network utilization across multiple networks and determining what application and application configurations parameters to create or update and to send to the end users devices. The profile manager can determine if users are moved to a new job role or an existing job role and can resolve conflicts in access to applications across incident and non incident agencies . The profile manager can update profile application APN and security access based on user roles agency and regional access. That is application access may vary across users agencies and regions and the profile manager can resolve any conflicts and provide requisite access when needed for incident response. Further the profile manager can assesses the network bandwidth continuously monitor and assess applications and QoS and optimize network usage via the device profiles and via the Tier strategy.

Here the incident agency that is agency requests resources from one or more non incident agencies that is agencies . . . N within the state or region of incident agency or outside another state or region . Responders from the non incident agencies . . . N use their existing devices from their current agency and travel to the incident to provide aid and assistance. Each responding non incident agency mobile device B C is updated to work with the apps of incident agency including the local and regional apps of the incident agency etc. Again the profile manager can be implemented over one or more Device Management Systems in one or more regions or agencies . . .

6. Determine an incident agency contact list PTT groups and any other groups to append to new agency devices and or existing non incident agency devices.

The profile manager takes existing profiles in the profile database for users that is for their mobile devices and updates profiles or creates an instance of the profile for this incident for that user device. The profile manager then notifies the incident agency CAD A that profiles are ready step . The incident agency CAD A notifies the non incident agency CAD that is CAD B that profiles are ready for updating of the new agency devices and or non incident agency devices B C step . The non incident agency CAD B authorizes the profile manager to send updates to a non incident agency DM SIM OTA step . The DM SIM OTA maintains instances of incident related profiles i.e. the updated profiles and normal or default profiles for the new agency devices and or the non incident agency devices B C step . The non incident agency DM SIM OTA then updates the devices B C with the updated profiles over the air step .

When the incident is completed the incident agency CAD A operator removes the non incident agency users devices and the agency user s new devices from the incident step . The incident agency CAD A notifies the profile manager to restore the non incident agency users or the agency user s new devices to their normal or default profile i.e. the profile for the non incident agency step . The profile manager sends a notification to DM SIM OTA with the restored profiles i.e. the normal or default profiles step . The non incident agency DM SIM OTA then updates the devices B C with the normal or default profiles over the air to restore the devices to normal operation step .

In the regional subscriber profile process is illustrated. The incident agency CAD A operator gets an emergency notification of an occurrence of an incident and assigns an incident type and resources within the agency to the incident step . The incident agency CAD A operator requires resources outside of the incident agency and makes a request to an assisting regional national agency to coordinate non incident agency resources i.e. resources of the one or more regional national agencies and the one or more agencies outside of the regional national agencies whose help is sought . The request may include information such as an identifier of the incident agency affiliated core number of resources needed role types needed incident type new agency devices and or non incident agency devices to be used a mutual aid flag and so on step . The assisting agency CAD F then communicates a need to the non incident agencies . . . N which request may includes an identifier of the incident agency a number of resources needed role type s needed incident type s new agency devices and or non incident agency devices to be used a mutual aid flag and so on step . A non incident agency CAD such as CAD B then sends resources over that are available user IDs device IDs current role new role to the assisting regional national agency CAD F step .

4. Update profile applications APNs and security access based on job roles the incident agency and the agency of the user if different and regional access 

6. Determine an incident agency contact list and PTT groups to append to new agency devices and or existing non incident agency devices.

The profile manager takes existing profiles in the profile database for users device and creates and or updates profiles for device IDs and affiliates with user IDs associated with the assisting agency devices F step . The assisting agency identifies the appropriate DM SIM solution to use in updating the devices F step . The profile manager indicates that profiles are ready for updating of the assisting agency devices F which devices F are being provided to the non incident agency responders that is the responders of the one or more regional national agencies and the one or more agencies outside of the regional national agencies whose help is sought step . The DM SIM OTA maintains instances of the incident and normal or default profiles of the devices and updates the devices F step . When the incident is completed the incident agency CAD A notifies the assisting regional national agency CAD F step . The assisting agency CAD F removes non incident agency users or the agency user s new devices from the incident and notifies the profile manager which notifies the DM SIM OTA to restore the normal or default profile on the device ID associated with the assisting agency devices F step .

A first responder can be responding to an incident and may have already traveled to the jurisdiction of the incident agency that is where the incident is located. The first responder s device may not have access to the local incident agency s applications but an incident commander can authorize the first responder s device so that it can receive a profile update from a local device manager or such that a full set or a subset of the incident commander s profile can be shared and used by the first responder. Once the profile is updated on the first responder s device also referred to as a mutual aid device a profile manager in the region reports to the incident agency s CAD that is CAD A that the mutual aid device is available and the CAD can track it.

In the device profile process is illustrated. First an incident agency device A of an incident commander is on scene at an incident step . A non incident agency first responder i.e. a first responder from another jurisdiction comes into the vicinity of the incident to provide mutual aid. The first responder does not have access to applications of the incident agency or Application Programming Interfaces APIs of the incident agency in order to provide his location and availability to the incident agency CAD A step . A new agency device and or non incident agency device C profile manager makes a request to the profile manager of the incident agency device A for example via a short range wireless protocol such as Bluetooth BT Wi Fi etc. for a profile update so that the device C can access necessary applications to respond to the incident step . The profile manager of the incident agency device A makes a request to an identity management or the security profile database of the incident agency to authorize and enable authentication of device C or a group of devices that includes device C across multiple networks and to update the device profile s of these device s so that it they can access applications APNs of the incident agency step .

After the new agency device and or non incident agency device C is authenticated the incident agency device A provides either a copy of device A s profile or requests that the regional profile manager provide a profile corresponding to the first responder s utilizing device C role in the incident step . The profile manager provides the appropriate profile to the device C either via the incident agency device A that initiated the request or via an agency or regional DM step . The profile manager in the region then notifies the incident agency CAD A that a first responder is on scene and of his or her role and related information. The incident agency CAD A then adds that user device to a resource pool and tracks the device s location etc. step .
