Embodiments of the inventive subject matter relate generally to wagering game systems and networks that more particularly control and reward gaming related socialization.

Wagering game machines such as slot machines video poker machines and the like have been a cornerstone of the gaming industry for several years. Traditionally wagering game machines have been confined to physical buildings like casinos e.g. resort casinos road side casinos etc. . The casinos are located in specific geographic locations that are authorized to present wagering games to casino patrons. However with the proliferation of interest and use of the Internet shrewd wagering game manufacturers have recognized that a global public network such as the Internet can reach to various locations of the world that have been authorized to present wagering games. Any individual with a personal computing device e.g. a personal computer a laptop a personal digital assistant a cell phone etc. can connect to the Internet and play wagering games. Consequently some wagering game manufacturers have created wagering games that can be processed by personal computing devices and offered via online casino websites online casinos . However online casinos face challenges and struggles. For instance online casinos have struggled to provide the excitement and entertainment that a real world casino environment provides. Some online casinos have struggled enforcing cross jurisdictional restrictions and requirements. Further some online casinos have struggled adapting the online gaming industry to a traditionally non wagering game business environment. As a result wagering game manufacturers casino operators and online game providers are constantly in need of innovative concepts that can make the online gaming industry appealing and profitable.

This description of the embodiments is divided into five sections. The first section provides an introduction to embodiments. The second section describes example operations performed by some embodiments while the third section describes additional example embodiments. The fourth section describes example operating environments while the fifth section presents some general comments.

Social communication is on the rise. Internet users are enjoying a proliferation of social networking venues such as social networking websites. Social networking websites allow users to create user accounts with one or more unique identifiers that represent an online persona. One example of a unique identifier is an avatar . Avatars are graphical cartoon like depictions of a social network persona. These online personas and associated avatars add to the fun of belonging to a social network. Another example of a unique identifier is an online name. Many of those Internet users are also wagering game enthusiasts. Many social networking venues e.g. websites however present an unsatisfactory experience to those users who would enjoy integration with gaming related features. Further casinos and wagering game providers desire to incentivize users of social networking venues to visit casinos or online wagering venues that include wagering game content.

The message I love the JackpotParty sitewide events is a personal expression or statement of interest or promotion indicated by the user regarding specific features or elements of a gaming venue such as the site wide event feature of the online casino website Jackpotparty.com . The server can analyze the message after it is published to search for promotional expressions e.g. words phrases etc. that promote the gaming venue. For example the server can parse the message and search for first phrases e.g. words or combinations of words that match or are substantially similar to second phrases from a group or library of key words or phrases as indicated in a list . For example the list includes at least four key phrases key phrase A Jackpotparty.com key phrase B site wide event key phrase C WMS game replay and key phrase D Playerslife.com . The key phrases A B C and D A D are separate words or phrases that describe gaming related items or activities such as but not limited to a gaming venue a feature or activity of a gaming venue a wagering game a type of wagering game a gaming provider a casino a player account a group game challenge an invitation to perform gaming activity a recording of gaming activity a virtual wagering game asset or trophy a gaming benefit a wager etc.

The key phrases A D can be stored in a relational database. The key phrases A D include identifiers A B C and D A D that respectively identify the key phrases A D. Each of the key phrases A D also include award values such as default point values A B C and D A D . The default point values A D indicate non monetary values for points that the server can award for usage of one or more of the key phrases A D within the message .

The server tracks in a report usage and rewards for the usage of the key phrases A D. For example the report indicates key phrase identifiers A B C and D A D which correspond to the key phrase identifiers A D in the list . The report also includes time stamp indicators that indicate times dates etc. for the use of the key phrases A D. The report also specifies requirements or conditions A B C and D A D associated with the usage of the key phrases A D. The conditions A D can be specified by a set of rules or requirements stored in and or accessible to the server . The server can detect attributes e.g. properties characteristics conditions etc. associated with publication of the message and compare the attributes to the rules or requirements. The report also specifies augmentation values or multipliers A C and D associated relatively with the conditions A C and D. The server can also associate the multipliers A C and D with the rules or requirements. The report also specifies awarded point values A B C and D A D associated with the usage of the key phrases A D based on the conditions A D. Two of the conditions A and B will be explained in more detail in the paragraph below including the usage of the multiplier A to generate two of the awarded point values A and B. Others of the conditions i.e. C and D will be described in further below.

Regarding the two conditions A and B for instance at 12 15 PM e.g. indicated via the clock the message is published. The server analyzes the message and identifies that two phrases from the message JackpotParty and sitewide events are substantially similar to two key phrases key phrase A and key phrase B. The server therefore notates the usage of the key phrases A and B in the report and awards the awarded point values A and B which correspond to the use of the key phrases A and B at 12 15 PM. For the awarded point value B the server recognizes that the usage of the key phrase B is a basic promotional usage of the phrase site wide events and therefore assigns the default point value B from the list as the awarded point value B. In other words the server awards the awarded point value B the value of 1 exactly equivalent to the default point value B the value of 1 . In some embodiments however the server can dynamically augment one or more of the default point values A D based on conditions associated with the publication of the message . For instance at 12 15 PM the user utilized the tag symbol for the phrase JackpotParty. The phrase JackpotParty when used in combination with the tag symbol at that particular time 12 15 PM caused a conversation stream associated with the topic JackpotParty to trend upward when the topic was trending downward via a social networking website. The server therefore dynamically assigns the multiplier value A because of the time related conditions and the trending conditions associated with the usage of the key phrase A at 12 15 PM. The server multiplies the default point value A the value of 2 by the multiplier value A the value of 2 to generate the awarded point value A the value of 4 .

In some embodiments the system provides a point counter that dynamically or immediately shows a point count increase or a potential point count that could result if a promotional expression were made via a social communication mechanism. For example at 12 15 PM after the user receives the five points for usage of the key phrases A and B the point counter increase a daily count indicator to a numerical value of 5. The point counter can show additional information including reports. For example activation of reporting control can present various types of reports for points earned usage of promotional phrases etc. for any time range subject matter range e.g. on specific tagged topics etc. including but not limited to any or all of the information from the report .

In some embodiments the system utilizes relationships between users e.g. between the Marcus Miller user and other users of the social network . In some embodiments the relationship between users is as affiliate relationship. An affiliate relationship can include for instance a linked or associated relationship between users where an activity performed by a first user is attributed to a second user because of the associated relationship. The first user receives a form of benefit because of the second user s activity. In some embodiments the first user can also receive a portion e.g. a proportional amount of benefits received by the first user. The affiliate relationship can be a result of efforts that the first user performed to entice the second user to register for and obtain a player account for a social networking venue or a wagering game venue. In some embodiments the server can detect that a link included in the message is activate by users e.g. affiliated users total users a combination etc. . The link is to an online gaming venue such as Jackpotparty.com . The server can track a number of times that other users activate the link and visit the website. The sever can award points that vary in value based on the number of activated links to the online gaming venue e.g. the server can increase any of the multipliers A C or D or generate other multipliers based on a number of links that were activated via the message after the message was published . Tracking activated links is only one way of tracking activities and or awards between users. Other examples are described further below such as in .

Further some embodiments of the inventive subject matter describe examples of controlling and rewarding gaming socialization in a network wagering venue e.g. an online casino a wagering game website a wagering network etc. using a communication network such as the communications network in . Embodiments can be presented over any type of communications network that provides access to wagering games such as a public network e.g. a public wide area network such as the Internet a private network e.g. a private local area network gaming network a file sharing network a social network etc. or any combination of networks. Multiple users can be connected to the networks via computing devices. The multiple users can have accounts that subscribe to specific services such as account based wagering systems e.g. account based wagering game websites account based casino networks etc. .

Further in some embodiments herein a user may be referred to as a player i.e. of wagering games and a player may be referred to interchangeably as a player account. Account based wagering systems utilize player accounts when transacting and performing activities at the computer level that are initiated by players. Therefore a player account represents the player at a computerized level. The player account can perform actions via computerized instructions. For example in some embodiments a player account may be referred to as performing an action controlling an item communicating information etc. Although a player or person may be activating a game control or device to perform the action control the item communicate the information etc. the player account at the computer level can be associated with the player and therefore any actions associated with the player can also be associated with the player account. Therefore for brevity to avoid having to describe the interconnection between player and player account in every instance a player account may be referred to herein in either context. Further in some embodiments herein the word gaming is used interchangeably with gambling. 

Although describes some embodiments the following sections describe many other features and embodiments.

This section describes operations associated with some embodiments. In the discussion below some flow diagrams are described with reference to block diagrams presented herein. However in some embodiments the operations can be performed by logic not described in the block diagrams.

In certain embodiments the operations can be performed by executing instructions residing on machine readable storage media e.g. software while in other embodiments the operations can be performed by hardware and or other logic e.g. firmware . In some embodiments the operations can be performed in series while in other embodiments one or more of the operations can be performed in parallel. Moreover some embodiments can perform more or less than all the operations shown in any flow diagram.

In the flow begins at processing block where a wagering game system system receives a message that was published from a social communication application. For example a user posts a social networking message via a social communication application e.g. a user updates a profile status via FaceBook .com a user submits a Tweet via Twitter.com a user posts a blog or forum entry via PlayersLife .com a user submits a chat entry a user sends an email etc. . The social communication application may be a social communication mechanism as described previously. The system can detect that the message is associated with a player account. For example the system can link or otherwise associate a social networking account that belongs to the user with a wagering game player account that belong to the user e.g. the system can provide a tool where a user such as Marcus Miller can manually link his Facebook .com account to his PlayersLife.com account . In some embodiments the message may be sent via the social networking website. In other embodiments the message may be sent via a wagering game machine or other secondary application provided via a wagering game machine such as an in game chat application. In some embodiments the message can direct a user to a wagering game venue via an affiliate tracking mechanism e.g. see link described in . In some embodiments the social communication application can dynamically submit the message to a gaming server e.g. via data provided in a link URL via an email carbon copy via a chat widget submittal etc. . In other embodiments the gaming server can search for the message e.g. scan websites scan blog communications search chat message etc. to find the message .

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines that a promotional expression which promotes a wagering game venue is contained within the message. For example the system can parse the message into a plurality of words compare the plurality of words to a library of promotional words and phrases stored on a wagering game server and detect that at least one of the plurality of words is equivalent to or substantially similar to one of the promotional words or phrases as similarly described in . In some embodiments the system can search for tags e.g. specific textual characters link data metadata micro memes etc. . For example the tags can be indicated by specific tag symbols e.g. from a set of special characters that specify that one of the plurality of words is a promotional word or phrase. For example the system can search for words that are preceded by an asterisk symbol a pound symbol etc. In some embodiments the system can utilize specific tag symbols provided by a social networking venue that are specifically used via a social communication application for specific reasons. For example Twitter.com utilizes a hash symbol the symbol to specify that a word or group of words is being used for a specific topic a hash symbol is sometimes referred to as a hash tag or hashtag . Twitter.com provides the hash symbol for users to positively identify the topic for a communication stream by multiple users. In some embodiments the system can detect the use of the specific characters e.g. the hash symbol by a running a query against an application programming interface API provided by the social networking venue. In some embodiments the system can utilize its own unique gaming related tags or symbols that help users to identify gaming related topics. Users can utilize the a gaming related hash symbol e.g. dollar symbols that precede and follow a word or phrase such as Jackpot Party to focus communications on gaming related topics e.g. to ensure that multiple words that form a gaming phrase are not interpreted as separate words and to identify the words as gaming related words . The system can track trends within the scope of the gaming related topics and determine whether the use of the tags and accompanying promotional expressions cause trends to increase or decrease toward the topic. The system can store key phrases in a relational database that ties the use of the key phrases to player s accounts. The system can transmit information regarding usage of gaming related key phrases in query strings cookies links etc.

The flow continues at processing block where the system provides an award in satisfaction of a condition associated with the promotional expression. For example the condition may be that the promotional expression is substantially similar to a word or phrase stored in a key phrase library that the promotional expression fits a specific form or that the promotional expression is submitted via a specific website. The condition can be associated with the message the transmission or receipt of the message the comparison of the message to promotional phrases the promotional phrases etc. In some embodiments the system can detect that a property associated with publication of the message satisfies the condition. For example the system can detect that the message is published within a specific time period detect that the one of the plurality of key phrases causes a topic to trend upward for the social networking website application detect that the message is republished via an affiliate user account etc.

The system can provide the award to incentivize and or reward the use of promotion expressions key phrases to a degree and or value associated with the condition. For instance the system can incentivize users with awards to keep up a communication trend. In some embodiments the awards can be in session encouragement benefits content displays etc. For instance the system can indicate a user s promotional efforts via a meter or a leaderboard. In some embodiments the awards are persistent objects such as virtual assets e.g. trophies accomplishments etc. or a number of points e.g. loyalty or achievement points associated with a wagering game venue. The system can transfer and store the awards via a player account associated with the wagering game venue. The player account may be linked to a social networking account associated with a social networking website or social communication application.

In some embodiments the system can apply fraud rules to ensure that a user is not abusing usage of promotional terms and or key phrases or is abusing an affiliate reward system. In some embodiments the system can cap awards to incentivize other gaming activity e.g. place a cap on points until a player visits a gaming venue .

The flow continues at processing block where the system assigns a value to the award dependent on a value associated with the condition. The value associated with the condition can be a degree of significance of the condition. For example the system can detect a number of times that a message is republished and assign a point value based on the number of times. In another example the system can assign a weight factor multiplier etc. that increases or augments the value based on a significance value associated with the condition e.g. see description of multiplier A in . Some points may have different types or tiers or importance or significance. For example the system can award a first type of point for one activity and a different type of point for a different activity or for exceeding a threshold of the first activity. For example some points may only be earnable by performing activities in a casino. Other points may have a first value when used outside a casino and a second higher point value when used inside a casino. The system can also assign a limitation to the use of the points within a casino. For instance some points may be earned outside a casino but only become active when a player or a group of the player s friends goes into a casino and uses the point there for game play on a wagering game machine or for group wagering activities e.g. slot tournament play at same bank etc. . In some embodiments the in casino activity can be a continuation of a persistent state game that is played outside the casino but by coming into the casino within a certain amount of time the points are unlocked. Casino activity can also unlock a higher value or type of points.

Some types of key phrases utilized via promotional expressions may have different values based on various factors or conditions associated with the publication of the message. Some examples of factors or conditions may include but not be limited to the following 

In some embodiments a player e.g. the user Marcus Miller earns an award by making promotional comments related to gaming via a social communication mechanism as similarly described in . Some of the awards such as the points earned for using key phrases A and B are usable only within a casino for instance when playing a wagering game via the wagering game machine . The wagering game may be a slot game that includes reels a bet meter a credit meter etc. The user can login to the wagering game machine via a player account indicated via the player login console and play the wagering game via a wagering game session. The player account can access the points earned by the player e.g. the five points earned at 12 15 PM via the usage of key phrases A and B to perform gaming activity for the wagering game . During the wagering game session e.g. at 3 45 PM as indicated via the clock the player can receive a specific gaming result e.g. a random result of three shamrocks in a row via a combination of symbols on the reels . In response to the gaming result an in game chat application automatically inserts a message into a message area of the in game chat application . The message describes the gaming activity. A post control is included in the in game chat application . A player can activate the post control e.g. via button press via touch screen etc. which publishes the message to one or more social networking venues e.g. to Playerslife.com to Facebook.com to Twitter.com etc. as indicated by selection controls and selection controls and can instead be included in a user s profile settings . The system can reward the player for publishing the message while in the casino. The message may include a promotional expression that matches a key phrase such as the key phrase D shown in . Referring momentarily to the server makes an entry into the report indicating the condition D which specifies that the key phrase D i.e. Playerslife.com was published while in a casino. Because the key phrase D was published via casino activity the server rewards the promotion more significantly and utilizes the multiplier D e.g. the value of 10 which when multiplied by the default point value D i.e. the value of 1 results in the total awarded point value D i.e. the value of 10 .

Referring back to a social contact of the first user e.g. a second user S. Saiz who is a friend of the first user Marcus Miller may view a publication of the message via the mobile device using a gaming widget installed on the mobile device . The account server links the first user Marcus Miller via the player account to other accounts or affiliates one of which is the user account for the second user S. Saiz. The second user views a replay of the player s achievement e.g. S. Saiz views at 7 45 PM as indicated by the clock the replay and posts a comment e.g. via the post control . The comment includes the key phrase C i.e. the phrase WMS game replay . The server for example may award the second user e.g. via user account the default point value C for the usage of the key phrase C. However referring again to in the report the server specifies a multiplier C because of the affiliate relationship between the first user and the second user and because the second user commented e.g. via the gaming widget about content generated via the first user s gaming activity e.g. the message published during the first user s wagering game session .

In some embodiments the server may also provide an additional reward because the second user viewed the gaming replay . For instance the first user receives a bonus reward in the wagering game and or receives an award of points e.g. wins a total award value in the report in because the condition indicated that a sufficient number of affiliates such as S. Saiz viewed the game replay . In some embodiments if enough users click on the post of the message or if the first user can get enough other users to register for an online account to see the posted message the first user may re win the wagering game win. Further the users who register to see a post of the message can possibly win that win value that the first user won or win some other award e.g. additional points .

The flow continues at processing block where the system assigns an attribute to the object which attribute provides access to a gaming benefit available to the first player account. For instance the attribute may grant access to non monetary benefits associated with a level of status of the player account. In some embodiments the system assigns or enriches one or more points with the attribute. For instance the system can provide a tool for a user to configure specific points via player preference to share benefits that are available to the user e.g. to share Very Important Person or VIP status benefits for a player account associated with the user . In other embodiments the system can automatically assign the attribute to the points. In some embodiments the system provides a mobile application that can be downloaded from a wagering game machine by a first user and transferred between mobile devices from one social contact to another as described below in . The system can assign the attribute to the mobile application so that when a second user who receives the mobile application returns to the casino the system can provide access to gaming benefits such as VIP status benefits of the first user who received the mobile application.

The flow continues at processing block where the system detects a selection of the one or more additional player accounts and transfers the object to the one or more additional player accounts where the one or more additional player accounts are authorized to access the non monetary gaming benefit of the first player account via use of the object. For example in a wagering game system system includes a first wagering game machine a second wagering game machine and a computer connected via a communications network . The system can also include multiple mobile devices such as a first mobile device and a second mobile device . The first wagering game machine can connect to the first mobile device which belongs to a first user that is logged in to the first wagering game machine during a wagering game session e.g. to the Marcus Miller user . During the wagering game session at stage A the first wagering game machine detects an event e.g. the user attains an achievement via game play and the first wagering game machine transfers a first copy a mobile application to the first mobile device . The first wagering game machine also transfer a number of benefit enriched points that have been enriched with attributes that grant access to gaming benefits such as access rights to gaming benefits that belong to the first user. In some embodiments at stage B the first user transfers the benefit enriched points to a second user e.g. to the S. Saiz user via a gaming application . The first user can use the computer to present the gaming application via a web browser . In addition at stage C the first user can transmit an additional copy of the mobile application to a second mobile device that belongs to the second user e.g. to S. Saiz while away from the casino. Later when the second user visits the casino and logs on to the second wagering game machine the second mobile device communicates with the second wagering game machine at stage D. The second wagering game machine detects that the second mobile device has the second copy of the mobile application and grants access to the gaming benefits that belong to the first user e.g. as indicated via the display such as benefits associated with the first user s status. The second wagering game machine further detects use of the benefit enriched points to access additional gaming benefits such as access to a virtual asset that belongs to the first user and that grants access to features and or enhances the features of a wagering game or bonus game e.g. grants access to or enhances award multipliers causes a reduction of gaming elements increases an expected payout value for a game or wagering game machine etc. . The player can use the features or feature enhancements to increase odds of winning during wagering games.

In some embodiments the system can provide additional benefits such as awarding a higher expected value for a number of game plays e.g. for the first five spins because the second player account had attained the mobile application from a player with an advanced level of status. In some embodiments the system can provide rewards to the first player because the second player had a copy of the mobile application on the second mobile device . The first user can receive points for instance or a portion of the points that the second player wins during the gaming session. In some embodiments the system can provide awards based on a position in the chain of downloads between players from the first player account to the second account via one or more additional mobile devices. In some embodiments the mobile application can present non wagering games e.g. casual games that the first or second users can play and earn awards e.g. points . Based on an affiliate relationship and or a position in the download chain of the mobile application the system can reward a portion of points earned by the second user during the non wagering game play to the first user s account.

In the flow begins at processing block where a wagering game system system selects a first number of non monetary points wagered on a prediction of an event the non monetary points being associated with a player account. The points in some embodiments have no monetary value or in other words are not derived from or equivalent to a cash or money value. For instance in some embodiments the points are complimentary points or loyalty points earned via activity or use of a service or product such as services and or games associated with a gaming venue. Nevertheless in some embodiments the points may be transferred or sold for money or used for activities that normally require money if permitted. illustrates an example. In a wagering game system system includes a computer connected to a wagering game server and a web server via a communications network . The wagering game sever detects a prediction of an event via a first application a gaming widget . The gaming widget includes a first control that can launch non wagering games from which a player can earn points. The gaming widget also presents a control that launches a wagering panel through which a player can select a first number e.g. bet amount of non monetary points via a points betting console as a wager on a prediction of any event with an unknown outcome or uncertainty of occurrence indicated via player input though use of an event indicator . The event can occur via play of a non wagering game launched via the first control e.g. an accomplishment of a certain goal or level of play within the non wagering game . The bet amount is a wager that the event will either occur or not occur. For example the wager can be on a prediction that a user will perform a specific social communication such as status post or comment e.g. a post and or comment on a Facebook wall . In some embodiments the bet can be against others regarding performance of playing casual games. Other bets can be for other events such as a bet on an occurrence of weather a bet on an outcome of a sporting event etc. In some embodiments the event can be a pre defined set of activities e.g. select an event from a dropdown to predict that event will occur or a non predefined event specified by the user a challenger or a broker. For example the bet can be that the player will be within a leader board position within a specific time period e.g. a bet that the player will be a top ten player within a month . The wagering panel can also include a challenge control to challenge another player to the wager of the points. For example the wagering game server selects an additional account e.g. an additional social network account and or an additional player account in response to a user input via the gaming widget . The additional account can be associated with the user as a social contact via the social networking website. The wagering game server can transmit a notification that challenges the additional account to wager a second number of points against the first number of points indicated via the betting console . If the player wins the wagering game server can transfer the second number of points from the second account to the first account in response to detecting the event.

The wagering widget can be an application on a webpage of a social network website e.g. Facebook.com where the presentation of the webpage is associated with a social network session for a social network account via a web browser . The bet amount is from a player account that is associated with the social network. The webpage can also present social networking applications such as non wagering games and other applications .

The flow continues at processing block where the system detects the event. The event occurs subsequent to the indication of the event e.g. via the wagering panel in .

The flow continues at processing block where the system provides a second number of non monetary points at least equivalent to the first number of non monetary points in response to the detection of the event. For example the system provides a second number of non monetary points at least equivalent to the first number of non monetary points in response to said detecting the prediction of the event and in response to said detecting the event.

According to some embodiments a wagering game system system can provide various example devices operations etc. to control and reward gaming related socialization. The following non exhaustive list enumerates some possible embodiments.

In some embodiments the system can provide all in betting of points e.g. a player can wager a balance of points that during game play the player will attain a gaming achievement or else lose all of the wagered point. . In some instances if the player wins points at a game the system can present an option to take the points or gamble all of those points to double them e.g. via a picking game . illustrates via the gaming widget an all in betting control . In another example the system can provide a control that a user can use to bankroll points. For example a player creates an event puts up points to win or lose and or brokers the points on the event. The bankrolling player can earn additional points for bankrolling the points. In some embodiments bankrolling can be performed within a casino via a wagering game machine. For example a player sitting at a wagering game machine bank can offer a certain amount of points to win if another player at the bank hits a specific gaming event e.g. four of a kind a specific reel stop combination etc. . If the other player achieves the specific gaming event then the other player wins the points bankrolled by the first player. The first player that bankrolled the points could also win points for initiating a points wagering session that utilized the player s bankroll of points. For example the first player could receive points from the other player e.g. as a signup fee for the points wagering session and or if the other player does not attain the event and or receive points from a casino for initiating the points wagering session.

In some embodiments the system can convert points into gaming credits for use in gaming at different conversion levels based on a player s history of play or amount of points e.g. a VIP can get twice a rate as someone else . In some embodiments the system can provide points with varying values that a player can use to attain different gaming type rewards. Some tiers of points can have higher payback rates for a wagering game machine. The tiers of points can affect an expected payout value of wagering games on the wagering game machine. For example use of a highest tier of points can enable a 97 expected payback percentage use of a next highest tier of points can enable a 96 expected payback percentage etc. down to a default expected payback percentage for use of no points. In another example one tier of points can provide an extra percentage payout for a progressive or that causes bonuses or other events to occur more often. In another example a higher tier of points can increase a number of slot reel pay lines. In some embodiments the system can track transference of points between players.
