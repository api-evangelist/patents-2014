title: Method of processing javascript (JS) API requests
abstract: Some embodiments of the invention provide a novel server for processing application programming interface (API) requests. In some embodiments, the API server is written in JavaScript. For example, in some embodiments, the API-accessible objects of this server are each defined in terms of a JavaScript file and a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file. At runtime, a runtime processor instantiates each JavaScript object from its associated JavaScript and JSON files. Once instantiated, the JavaScript object can be used to process API requests that refer to the JavaScript object. Some embodiments use novel JSON file structures that allow these embodiments to define rich JavaScript models.
