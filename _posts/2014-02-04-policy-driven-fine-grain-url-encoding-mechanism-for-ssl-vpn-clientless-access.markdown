The present application claims priority to and is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 359 101 entitled Policy Driven Fine Grain URL Encoding Mechanism for SSL VPN Clientless Access and filed on Jan. 23 2009 which claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 023 847 filed on Jan. 26 2008 both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.

The present invention generally relates to data communication networks. In particular the present invention relates to systems and methods for fine grain configuration and policy driven Uniform Resource Locator URL encoding schemes for clientless Secure Socket Layer SSL Virtual Private Network VPN access scenarios.

A company or an enterprise may provide various services across a network to serve many clients. Some of those clients may want to request access to resources on a private network. For example a user may access a private network of an enterprise from a public location or network via a virtual private network connection. The user may access a resource that is desired to be protected. The provider might allow clients to access the resource but would like to protect the identification or location of the resource on the private network. For example a resource may typically be identified by a Uniform Resource Locator URL . If the provider provides the URL of the resource on the private network a client or user may try to gain access to that resource via an unsecured means or directly outside of the virtual private network connection. Depending on the access scenario the provider may not want to provide the URL on the private network directly to the client.

The present disclosure provides solutions to such problems by allowing the provider to use various schemes for encoding URLs and to select the encoding scheme for different clients based on the access scenario. In some scenarios such protections may involve obscuring or changing the URL of the resources to disable the clients from viewing the resource locations while allowing the clients to access the resources themselves. In some scenarios providing the resource to the clients while not allowing the clients to see the location of the resources may be done by rewriting obfuscating or encrypting the URLs the clients receive. Sometimes the providers may want to alter the URLs in ways which depend on the credibility of the client the security concerns relating the client or the type of the client.

In some aspects the present disclosure is related to systems and methods for determining an encoding scheme of a uniform resource location URL from a plurality of encoding schemes for a clientless secure socket layer virtual private network SSL VPN via a proxy. An intermediary or an appliance may receive a response comprising a URL from a server. The response from the server may be directed to a client via a SSL VPN session and via the intermediary. The intermediary may establish the SSL VPN session between the client and the server. The intermediary may determine responsive to an encoding policy an encoding scheme from a plurality of encoding schemes for encoding the URL. The intermediary may also rewrite the URL for transmission to the client in accordance with the determined encoding scheme.

In some embodiments the policy is a session policy determining at least one rule to trigger at least one action with respect to the established session. In many embodiments the encoding scheme removes a portion of the URL. In many embodiments the encoding scheme rewrites a portion of the URL with a portion of another URL. In numerous embodiments the encoding scheme encrypts a portion of the URL using one or more encryption keys. In many embodiments the encoding scheme is a transparent encoding scheme. In a plurality of embodiments the encoding scheme is an opaque encoding scheme. In various embodiments the encoding scheme transforms the URL using a reversible transformation mechanism. Sometimes the encoding scheme is an encrypted encoding scheme encrypting a portion of the URL. In many embodiments the encoding scheme rewrites the URL to a unique identifier the unique identifier uniquely identifying the URL. In various embodiments the encoding scheme obfuscates an information relating a directory structure of the server from the URL.

In some embodiments the intermediary receives a second response comprising a second URL from the server to a second client via a second SSL VPN session. The intermediary may establish the second SSL VPN session between the second client and the server. The intermediary may determine responsive to the encoding policy a second encoding scheme from a plurality of encoding schemes for encoding the URL. The intermediary may rewrite the second URL for transmission to the second client in accordance with the determined second encoding scheme. In some embodiments the policy is a second SSL VPN session policy determining at least one rule to trigger at least one action with respect to the established SSL VPN session.

In some aspects the present disclosure is related to an intermediary for determining an encoding scheme of a uniform resource location URL from a plurality of encoding schemes for a clientless secure socket layer virtual private network SSL VPN via a proxy. In some embodiments the intermediary may be also referred to as an appliance or a proxy. The intermediary may comprise a packet engine for receiving a response comprising a URL from a server to a client via a SSL VPN session. The intermediary may establish the SSL VPN session between the client and the server. The intermediary may also comprise a policy engine determining responsive to an encoding policy an encoding scheme from a plurality of encoding schemes for encoding the URL. The intermediary may further comprise a rewriter responsive to the policy engine rewriting the URL for transmission to the client in accordance with the determined encoding scheme.

In some embodiments the policy of the intermediary is a session policy determining at least one rule to trigger at least one action with respect to the established SSL VPN session. In many embodiments the encoding scheme removes a portion of the URL. Sometimes the encoding scheme rewrites a portion of the URL with a portion of another URL. In numerous embodiments the encoding scheme encrypts a portion of the URL using one or more encryption keys. The encoding scheme may be a transparent encoding scheme. A transparent encoding scheme may modify the URL such that the modified URL comprises a portion or a whole of the original URL within the modified URL. In some embodiments the encoding scheme is an opaque encoding scheme. An opaque encoding scheme may modify the URL such that the modified URL does not comprise a portion of the original URL within the modified URL.

In many embodiments the packet engine receives a second response comprising a second URL from a server to a second client via a second SSL VPN session. The intermediary may establish the second SSL VPN session between the second client and the server. The policy engine may determine responsive to an encoding policy a second encoding scheme from the plurality of encoding schemes for encoding the second URL. The rewriter responsive to the policy engine may rewrite the second URL for transmission to the client in accordance with the determined second encoding scheme. In some embodiments the policy is a second SSL VPN session policy determining at least one rule to trigger at least one action with respect to the established second SSL VPN session.

Referring now to an embodiment of a clientless virtual private network VPN environment for accessing a server via an appliance or proxy is depicted. In brief overview the client operates on computing device and executes a browser operated by a user. The client may be on a first network such as a public network. A user on the client may request via the browser access to a resource on a second network such as a private network of an enterprise. The appliance provides the user a clientless VPN access to the requested resource. The client may not install execute or otherwise any agent component program driver or application that is constructed and or designed to provide VPN connectivity referred to as client based VPN to the network . Instead the appliance or proxy may rewrite responses from the server and requests from the client to provide VPN functionality without the user of a VPN agent operating on the client. For example the appliance may rewrite Uniform Resource Locators URLs between the client and server such as URLs in any content server by the server or requests transmitted by the client. The appliance may rewrite URLs between the client and the server in a manner transparent and seamless to either or both of the client and the server. As such the client browser or server and server application do not need to have knowledge or be aware of the clientless SSL VPN access scenario.

The appliance may provide via an SSL VPN module previously described herein a facility for accessing a resource. In one embodiment the appliance provides a client based access to a network by providing installing or executing an SSL VPN agent on the client for communicating with the appliance . In some embodiments the appliance provides for clientless SSL VPN access to a resource such as an http https file share without having to download an SSL VPN client or agent to the client . For example a user may want to access the resources within company from an outside machine such at a kiosk on which he does not have privilege to install the client or does not want to go through the client installation process. The clientless SSL VPN feature is also useful when the SSL VPN client is not supported for the device e.g. new PDA in market but the device run an SSL enabled browser. In other embodiments the appliance chooses for a user between client based and clientless SSL VPN access to the resource based on policy and any policy rules actions and or conditions.

The client may include any type and form of user agent which may be a browser editor spider web traversing robots or any other end user tool or program.

In operation of the embodiment depicted by a user logs in at the SSLVPN site provided by the appliance such at a domain name and IP address hosted by the appliance . For example the user via a browser of the client may select or enter a URL to the SSL VPN site. The appliance may authenticate the user and may further determine authorization of the user to access the appliance or the SSL VPN site. After successful authentication the appliance serves a portal page to the client to display to the user via the browser. The portal page may include a navigation box such as a set of one or more user interface elements for a user to select to operate or run an application. The portal page may include links to other pages or URLs to which the user may have access. The URLs or links on the portal page may reference or identify the host name or IP address of the SSL VPN site provided by the appliance .

The user via the portal page may select one or more URLs for example by clicking on an active hyperlink or URL. In response the browser or client transmits a request to the domain hosted by the appliance . For example as depicted in the user may request an application of the server via the appliance https sslvpn.x.com cvpn http server.x.com app.cgi . In some embodiments the user sends another request such as for example https proxy.x.com cvpn http server.x.com app.cgi . The appliance receives the request from the client and rewrites the request to transmit to the server. For example as depicted in the appliance may remove or strip the domain name hosted by the appliance such as sslvpn.x.com or proxy.x.com and forward the remaining portion of the request to the server .

In response to the request the server serves content to the client. The content or body of the response may include embedded links or URLs to other pages of the server or to other servers on the network such as embedded links to http server.x.com app.cgi . The appliance rewrites the header and body to modify any URLs to reference the domain name or IP address of the SSL VPN site so that any further URL or link selection via the browser of the client communicates requests to the appliance . The appliance communicates the modified content to the client . The appliance such as via the AppFw sometimes referred to as AppSecure module may be designed and constructed to rewrite URLs of requests and responses based on policy of a policy engine. The links URLs in that page and other pages received subsequently from the server during this SSL VPN session are modified by the appliance in such a way that the links point to the SSLVPN site VPN VIP 275 and the original request URL absolute or relative is encoded within that request URL.

Referring now to another embodiment of a VPN environment for providing VPN access as well as cookie management is depicted. In brief overview the appliance may include a VPN module for handling any of the SSL VPN functionality clientless and or client based as described herein. The appliance and or VPN module may have an AAA module to perform any type and form of authentication authorization and auditing AAA and or to track and manage VPN session information.

The cookie may include cookie storage referred to as a cookie jar for adding or inserting cookies as well as removing cookies. The cookie manager or proxy may include functions logic or operations to store and look up cookie information in a cookie jar by URL domain name or other information of the request and or response. In some embodiments the appliance manages cookies on the behalf of clients that do not support cookies disabled cookies or for cases where it may be desired or preferred not to send cookies to the client.

The appliance may also include an AppFW also referred to as AppSecure in the context of an appliance manufactured by Citrix Systems Inc. The AppSecure module may include logic functions or operations for perform any type and form of content rewriting such as URL rewriting. In some embodiments the AppSecure module performs any type and form of content injection into a request and or response between a client and a server. In one embodiment the AppSecure module injects scripts into a response to the client such as a JavaScript to perform any type and form of desired functionality.

Any of the components of the appliance used for clientless SSL VPN access may be responsive to or driven by configuration such as via any one or more policies of the policy engine. The policies may direct and determine the type and form of URL encoding and decoding performed by the VPN module. In some embodiments the policies may direct and determine how and when the cookie proxy manages and proxies cookies. In other embodiments the policies may direct and determine how and when the AppSecure module performs URL rewriting and or content injection. The policies may direct the way a user access the private network and applications on the private networks. Policies may be configured based on access scenarios which can include access based on any combination of a user type and form of client type and form of network type of resources accessed types of applications used temporal information as well as any information that may be determined by the appliance via network traffic traversing thereto.

With reference to a flow of packets via the appliance for clientless SSL VPN access is discussed. In response to a successful login request the VPN appliance may send a portal page to the sender of the login request. The portal page may have one or more links in vpn encoded form as described in connection with . The portal page flows through the response code path described below. When a user clicks on any of the URLs in the portal page the packet flow may be implemented in a number of ways and using a number of steps. In some embodiments for request path at step Q the appliance may receive a URL request and look up the VPN session in the AAA module. At step Q the appliance may decode the VPN encoded URL to the expected URL for the server or the network . The appliance may also modify the header of the request such as the header values to server format or a format intended for transmission and use by the server such as the HTTP server for example. The appliance may reparse the header so that any other modules of the appliance see the request in the server format. At step Q in the request path the appliance via the cookie manager or proxy may look up the cookie for the request based on the domain and path of the URL. In some cases if the request should include a cookie the appliance may insert the cookie from a cookie jar. At step Q the appliance may resolve the domain name of the server present in the URL into an IP address of the server via a DNS lookup function module of the appliance. The appliance may create server information based on the DNS lookup in the AAA module. In addition authorization policies may be evaluated to determine if the request may be transmitted to the server. At step Q the appliance may send the request to the server. In some embodiments the appliance sends the request to the server provided that the authorization is successful.

In the response path from the server to the client via the appliance at step S the appliance may receive the response from the server. The VPN module may process the response. The VPN module may pass the response header to the cookie proxy module and the response body to the AppSecure module. At step S the cookie proxy may remove cookies from the header of the response that are not configured or otherwise identified as client consumed cookies and store them in a cookie jar used for the current session. At step S the AppSecure module may rewrite any URL in vpn encoded form as per rewrite policies. The AppSecure module may also insert into the response body any scripts such as JavaScript code to be executed at client side. At step S the appliance may send the modified response to the client. In many embodiments any of the Q or S steps happen in any order or in any combination with any other steps or embodiments described herein.

Referring now to systems and methods for providing fine grain configuration and policy driven Uniform Resource Locator URL encoding schemes are discussed. In brief overview one or more clients A N may establish SSL VPN session via the appliance to a server A N. Client A may establish a first SSL VPN session S1 via the SSL VPN site provided by the appliance . Client B may establish a second SSL VPN session S2 via the appliance . Client N may also establish a third SSL VPN session S3 via the appliance . The appliance may be configured with one or more session polices to define any rules to trigger any action to be taken with respect to any of the sessions S1 S3. In some cases a session policy directs triggers or otherwise determines what type of URL encoding scheme or mechanism to use such as via any of the URL encoding policies . For example the session policy may determine the URL encoding policy to use for a given session.

A URL encoding policy may identify one URL encoding scheme of a plurality of available encoding schemes to use for a session. Appliance may use URL encoding schemes for clientless SSL VPN access. For example the appliance may select and use one encoding scheme from a plurality of encoding schemes for clientless SSL VPN access for a particular user or a particular client . The appliance may comprise any functionality necessary to perform selection and use of a single encoding scheme from a plurality of encoding schemes. One or more polices may direct the URL encoding scheme to use for an access scenario. For example a policy may direct the SSL VPN module to use a predetermined type of URL encoding based on a rule or action identified for the established session of the client. As such an administrator may configure the appliance to use one of the plurality of encoding schemes for URL rewriting during a clientless SSL VPN session based on the user s access scenario. In some other examples a policy may direct the SSL VPN module to use a predetermined type of URL encoding based on a rule or action identified for the established user on the client established client or an established type or group of clients.

Session policy may be any type and form of policy for managing controlling and establishing sessions. In some embodiments session policy includes rules or policies for establishing sessions between clients and a servers via the intermediary . In other embodiments session policy includes rules or policies for managing sessions or governing the type of sessions established. In some embodiments session policy includes rules for establishing limitations or privileges to the sessions of the client based on information about the client. In some embodiments session policy may establish a specific session between the client and server based on the configuration of the client internet protocol address of the client history of the client or based on the user on the client . In further embodiments session policy includes rules for establishing limitations or privileges to any sessions established based on the type of session requested by the client such as the clientless SSL VPN session or client based SSL VPN session. For example session policy may comprise a policy that establishes one type of session for one type of request and another type of session for another type of request. Similarly session policy may include policies that establish different sessions based on the type of service or resource the client is requesting. In some embodiments session policy includes policies that establish different sessions based on the servers that the client is trying to access. The policies or rules may govern establishing as well as managing of the sessions based on any information relating the client server cookie configuration of the client or server type of network the client is using security features of the client or any other information relating the client or server . Session policy may establish one session having specific characteristics for one client and a different session having different characteristics for a different client . Specific characteristics of the sessions may include specific encoding policies available for each session specific encoding schemes for rewriting the URLs within each session specific communication protocols or any other similar feature of the session.

URL encoding policy may be any type and form of policy used for encoding modifying or transforming a URL. URL encoding policy may be any type and form of policy for choosing one or more specific encoding schemes for modifying encoding or transforming a URL. In some embodiments URL encoding policy includes rules and policies that choose any number of encoding schemes for encoding transforming or modifying the URLs. In some embodiments URL encoding policy identifies an encoding scheme from a plurality of encoding schemes to be used for a particular URL a particular client or a particular server . In some embodiments URL encoding policy identifies one or more encoding schemes for modifying rewriting or transforming the URLs for a particular session based on any information relating a client or server . In some embodiments URL encoding policy identifies the an encoding scheme for transforming or rewriting URLs between a client and server based on the user on the client . In some embodiments URL encoding policy identifies an encoding scheme based on the security information of the client such as the network the client is using the protection or level of security. In some embodiments URL encoding policy identifies an encoding scheme based on the session established for the client . URL encoding policy may include any number of different policies or schemes for transforming modifying or rewriting the URLs using specific ways and methods. URL encoding policy may include transparent opaque and encrypted schemes or policies as well as any combination of such policies or schemes to be used for transforming rewriting or modifying any number of URLs.

Each of the encoding schemes may provide different levels and granularity of security for a clientless SSL VPN access scenario. For example in some embodiments the URL encoding policy may identify one of the following URL encoding schemes transparent opaque and encrypted. A transparent URL encoding scheme may comprise a user visible reversible transformation of the URL. The transparent URL encoding scheme may transform or modify the URL to comprise a portion of the original URL within the transformed or modified URL. An opaque URL encoding scheme may use a reversible transformation which masks hides or obfuscates any part of the URL such as the host name and protocol. The opaque URL encoding scheme may transform or modify the URL such that it does not visibly identify or include a portion of the original URL within the transformed or modified URL. In some embodiments opaque URL encoding schemes allow the user or the client to view a portion of the original URL within the transformed URL. The transformed URL may comprise any portion of the original URL where the original URL is masked obfuscated or hidden. An encrypted URL encoding scheme may use a key such as a session id. In some embodiments the encrypted URL encoding scheme uses a randomly generated encryption key to encrypt the URL. Keys used for the encrypted URL encoding scheme may vary from user specific encryption keys to any keys generated by a symmetrical encryption system. The opaque and encrypted URL encoding schemes may obfuscate the URL to provide different levels of security.

In further details the appliance may be designed and constructed to use any type and form of URL encoding schemes and or mechanisms. In one embodiment the appliance rewrites the URL to some unique identifier for each URL. In further embodiments the appliance rewrites the URL as path in a URL relative to the domain IP hosted by the appliance. In one example the appliance may use the service or functionality provided by www.tinyurl.com to encode any URL to some relative URL under it. In further example the functionality of www.tinyurl.com may be rewritten to the URL http www.rediff.com index.html or to some relative URL under the site such as http tinyurl.com 9oatj . In still further example the appliance rewrites the URL as any other URL which may have a different or a same host name or path. In some cases the appliance rewrites the URL provided by a server to a relative URL under the SSL VPN site provided by the appliance . For example the appliance may rewrite a URL such as http www.y.com index.html into http sslvpn.x.com 9oatj In some embodiments 9oatj is a unique identifier for a given URL. In further example the appliance rewrites a URL such as http www.rediff.com index.html to http sslvpnsite.com 9oatj . The appliance may map track and store in memory or storage the rewritten URL to the original URL. When a request from the client identifying the rewritten URL is received the appliance looks up with the original URL associated or mapped to this rewritten URL. In some embodiments a transformed URL is transformed such that it comprises a portion or a whole of original non transformed URL within it. Sometimes such transformation may be reversible and transparent to the user. In some embodiments such transformation may be referred to as a transparent URL encoding scheme.

In some embodiments the appliance may use any type and form of encryption to provide an encrypted URL encoding scheme. For example the appliance may use a session key to encrypt decrypt URLs in response or request paths which are made relative to URLs under SSL VPN site. The session key may be stored on the appliance in the VPN session itself or derived using the session identifier. In some embodiments the appliance encrypts the entire URL or a portion of the URL. In one embodiment the appliance excludes the SSL VPN site hostname and or extension of the file from encryption. In other embodiments the appliance uses any key for encryption such as a key from the SSL session provided by the appliance or any unique information derived or determined via the network traffic. In some cases a certificate or any information therein may be used for the key such as a certificate of the client or server. In other cases a public key and or a private key may be used for encryption and decryption. The public or private key may be a key of the client server or appliance or any secure or encrypted sessions between these devices. In some embodiments the user such as the administrator may specify or configure the key s to use for encryption and or decryption. In another embodiment the administrator may configure the appliance to use one encryption technique from a plurality of encryption techniques.

In some embodiments URLs which point to the SSLVPN site of the appliance and have an encoded URL in path component of URL may be referred to as vpn encoded URLs . In some embodiments encoded absolute URLs may be also referred to as vpn encoded URLs . Using vpn encoded URLs has advantages in that such an approach may avoid costly lookup of the original URL in the request path. In some cases the appliance uses an encoded URL scheme to obfuscate the URLs so that directory structure at the server is not exposed. Symmetric encryption decryption using session key may be an approach for URL rewriting when URL encryption is needed. The appliance may implement both encryption as well as decryption of the URL. In some embodiments symmetric encryption decryption using session key may be an approach for URL rewriting when URL obfuscation is implemented. Other types of encoding schemes or encryption schemes may be used to obfuscate the URL as desired.

By way of example if the relative URL present in a page accessed from location http www.abc.com testsite index.html is contents file5.html the appliance such as via the AppSecure module converts this URL to an absolute URL http www.abc.com testsite contents file5.html . The appliance encrypts the absolute URL http www.abc.com testsite contents file5 using a symmetric key and arranges or places the encrypted string as part of a relative URL under the SSLVPN site such as svpn.mysite.com. For example if the URL without the file extension or suffix http www.abc.com testsite contents file5 is encrypted to a string wruiwdsym334d3434bmvc8sdsffsmds the URL for contents file5.html in the page provided by the appliance to the client may be https sslvpn.x.com cvpn wruiwdsym334d3434bmvc8sdsffsmds.html .

In some embodiments the appliance may apply opaque encoding or reversible translation or encryption which may also be referred to as vpn encoding to any portion of an URL. In one embodiment the appliance applies vpn encoding to other portions of the URL such as whole URL except the file extension or suffix. In another embodiment the appliance applies vpn encoding to the fully qualified domain name FQDN and protocol portions of the URL and the relative URLs are left unchanged. This kind of encoding may be useful when relative URLs embedded in various content types such as JavaScript are difficult to identify as relative URLs present in them can be left unchanged. In some embodiments the appliance applies opaque or reversible translation encoding to any portion of an URL. In one embodiment the appliance applies reversible translation encoding to the hostname portion of the URL. In another embodiment the appliance applies reversible translation encoding to the protocol portion of the URL. In still further embodiments the appliance applies reversible translation encoding to the hostname and protocol portions of the URL. In one embodiment the appliance applies reversible translation to portions of the URL other than the hostname and the protocol. In some embodiments the relative URLs are left unchanged. The opaque or reversible translation encoding may be useful in handling relative requests at client side or supporting some scripts.

In other embodiments such as for opaque type URL encoding the appliance may use any type and form of reversible translation mechanism or scheme such as Base64 encoding. In some cases the term Base64 refers to a MIME content transfer encoding. In other cases this term is also used as a generic term for any similar encoding scheme that encodes binary data by treating it numerically and translating it into a base 64 representation. In other embodiments the appliance may use any type and form of binary to text encoding such as base 32 uuencode or any other scheme. The reversible encoding scheme may use any type of characters dictionary or alphabet. In one embodiment a Base64 encoding may use a URL safe alphabet 52 English alphabets 10 digits and two other characters   and and no padding may be used.

URLs encoded using reversible translations may be bookmarked for use across SSL VPN sessions and the hostname is not visible to the user without performing decoding such as Base64 decoding. This opaque URL encoding may be used for SSL VPN clientless access where hiding the hostname strongly using an encrypted technique is not required and when hiding the directory structure is not a requirement.

By way of an example the appliance may rewrite a URL using Base64 encoding for the index.html of a page from URL http www.xyz.com html index.html as cvpn aHROcDovL3d3dy54eXouY29t html index.html . This approach allows bookmarked links to be used across SSL VPN session and only the root relative and absolute URLs may be rewritten. In comparison to the encrypted URL encoding technique the opaque encoding may however may not as effectively hiding the server name or directory structure on the server.

In some embodiments the appliance may use a transparent URL encoding scheme based on a user visible reversible translation. The appliance may rewrite URLs to make it a link to the SSLVPN site absolute or relative using any reversible transformations function so that original URL is more easily extracted. For example the appliance using a transparent encoding technique may rewrite the index.html of a page from URL http www.xyz.com html index.html as cvpn http www.xyz.com html index.html. This approach is very efficient in memory usage and computation as a lookup is not required. With this approach bookmarked URLs may also be used across different SSL VPN sessions and easily bookmarked.

In yet another embodiment the appliance may perform URL Rewriting that embeds any type and form of session information in the URL. For example if the browser of the client does not support cookies the appliance may embed session information in the encoded URL to identify and track the session such as for a clientless SSLVPN access scenario. In one embodiment the appliance stores or encodes the session id in the URL. In another embodiment the appliance stores or encodes a unique client identifier in the URL. In some embodiments the appliance stores or encodes cookies or cookie information in the URL.

The appliance may use a reversible translation such as a transparent or opaque approach described or an encrypted approach in rewriting the URL with the embedded session or other information. For example a translated URLs with a session id may be rewritten in the form of https svpn.mysite.com cvpns XYZ wruiwdsym334d3434bmvc8sdsffsmds.html using symmetric key encryption or https svpn.mysite.com cvpns XYZ http www.y.com html index.html for a reversible translation approach in which XYZ is the session id for the SSLVPN. In some embodiments the session id may be translated as part of the reversible translated portion of the URL or encrypted as part of the encrypted portion of the URL.

In some embodiments the appliance may use any combination of the transparent opaque and or encryption URL encoding for the entire URL or any portion thereof. For example the appliance may use a transparent technique for a first portion of the URL an opaque technique for a second portion of the URL and an encrypted technique for a third portion of the URL. The appliance may embed session information or any other appliance determined information in the first portion the second portion or the third portion of the URL.

In yet other embodiments the appliance may use any user defined encoding function or translation computation. In some embodiments the user via a programming language script library or any other interface may identify for the appliance an encoding scheme or mechanism or encoder to use. In another embodiment the user may specify which session cookie or other information to store or encode in the URL or portion thereof and what type of encoding transparent opaque encrypted or user defined to use if any.

In a number of embodiments the status of the client is determined based on the security level of the environment the client is in. For example some clients may be in a secured network environment while other clients may be in unsecured environments. This may result in the intermediary selecting a status of the client based on the environment the client is in. In some embodiments a status of the client is determined by collecting information about the client such as operating system existence and version of a personal firewall existence and version of virus protection type and version of browser etc. For example the client agent may collection information about the client.

In some embodiments the status of the client is determined by the server or the user on the server . In some embodiments the status of the client is determined by the appliance . In a plurality of embodiments a client is granted more access or granted access to more applications than another client. In some embodiments an authenticated users of a particular client has access to software applications or files of the server which other users of other clients do not have an access to. The appliance may assign a status to a client or a user of the client based on any one of or any combination of a level of safety or security of the network the client is in a type of the client a type of user of the client operating system of the client security system of the client user authentication user access and the sensitivity of the information the requested URL provides access to. In some embodiments the second client has a different status credentials or access from the first user. In a plurality of embodiments the credentials or the status of the first and second client are determined by metrics identifying the risk associated with the communication with the first client and the second client. The metrics identifying the risk associated with the communication with the first client and the second client may be any of or any combination of a level of safety or security of the network the client is in a type of the client a type of user of the client operating system of the client security system of the client user authentication user access and the sensitivity of the information the requested URL provides access to. In many embodiments the status and credentials are determined by a policy engine or one or more maps of the intermediary or the server .

In some embodiments the browsers may use the extension of the file in the request to derive the MIME type. The extension of the file if present in the request URL may remain unchanged. In some embodiments the extension is not present. In some embodiments the appliance checks for the presence of the extension. In some cases the whole URL may be rewritten or encoded except for the extension. In further embodiments the host name may be rewritten to make the host name a sub directory under the SSL VPN site provided by the appliance . In other cases only the host name and protocol are rewritten to make the host name a sub directory under the SSL VPN site. If the host name rewritten approach is used the relative URLs present in the page may be left unchanged and absolute URLs may need to be rewritten.

In further view of the appliance described herein provides fine granular control of the type and form of URL rewrite encoding to occur for any session traversing the appliance such as for a clientless SSL VPN session. Either on a global level or via policy the appliance may be configured to provide a predetermined type of URL encoding from a plurality of predetermined types of encoding such as transparent opaque encrypted user defined or any combination thereof. Via configuration or policy the user may specify which portions or elements of a URL to apply the predetermined type of encoding. Via configuration or policy the user may specify when and for whom to apply the URL encoding based on the access scenario.

The appliance may use any portion or combination of portions of a network packet request and or response to determine conditions under which a URL encoding scheme may be used. For example a rule of a policy may determine under what conditions to apply a predetermined URL encoding scheme based on evaluating portions of a network packet such as any part of the header or payload of any layer or protocol of the network stack. In some embodiments the appliance uses any portion of an HTTP header and or any portion of HTTP body or transaction layer to determine which actions to take and or policies to apply. In one embodiment the appliance uses structured information such as defined fields in a header or defined elements or structures in a body. In some embodiments the appliance uses unstructured information such as portions of the body identified by patterns location or other search and identified means. In other embodiments the appliance used both structured and unstructured information to use in policies and the rules and actions specified for the policy.

By way of example a user may specify the URL encoding mechanism at a global level such as via the following command line interface CLI instruction set vpn param ClientLessModeUrlEncoding opaque transparent encrypt To provide the flexibility of changing URL encoding per user group or a vserver VIP 275 the type of URL encoding may be configured as a parameter in a session policy s action add vpn session action ClientLessModeUrlEncoding opaque transparent encrypt Based on actions triggered for a session based on a condition of a rule evaluating to true or otherwise being triggered the URL Encoding mode specified with the action may be applied for rewriting URLS for the session. In some embodiments during opaque mode only the protocol and the hostname are encoded. In further embodiments opaque mode is default and only the protocol and FQDN are Base64 encoded so that user does not see the hostname or protocol in clear text. Any of the modes may be defined or configured to be the default URL encoding mode. In one embodiment of transparent mode no encoding is done and user may see which host is being accessed as well as the directory structure. In some embodiments of encrypt mode the hostname as well as the path is encrypted with the session key. The appliance may provide any arrangement or type of GUI to provide a user interface for specifying and configuring URL encoding and related policies.

Referring now to a flow chart of an embodiment of a method for determining an encoding scheme of a URL for a SSL VPN via an intermediary is illustrated. In a brief overview at step a first SSL VPN session is established between a first client and a server via an intermediary. At step a second SSL VPN session is established between a second client and the server via the intermediary. At step a packet engine of the intermediary receives a first response from the first client comprising a first URL from the server to the client via the first SSL VPN session. At step the packet engine of the intermediary receives a second response from the second client comprising a second URL from the server to the client via the second SSL VPN session. At step a policy engine uses an encoding policy to determine a first encoding scheme from a plurality of encoding schemes for encoding the first URL and a second encoding scheme from the plurality of encoding schemes for encoding the second URL. At step a rewriter of the intermediary responsive to the policy engine rewrites the first URL in accordance with the determined first encoding scheme and the second URL in accordance with the determined second encoding scheme.

In further details at step any component of a client a server or an intermediary establishes a first SSL VPN session between a first client and a server via an intermediary. In some embodiments any one of the first client intermediary or the server establishes the first SSLVPN session between the first client and the server. The first SSL VPN session may be established via any intermediary such as the appliance . The SSL VPN session established may be a secured session such as an encrypted client to server session. The first client server or the intermediary may establish the first SSL VPN session and assign a unique first identifier for uniquely distinguishing and identifying the first SSL VPN session from other SSL VPN sessions. Any one of the first client server and the intermediary may establish the first SSL VPN session via a communication protocol providing functionality or security to the sessions such as a Citrix ICA protocol. In some embodiments any one of a client server or an intermediary establishes a SSL VPN session using a handshake between any two of the first client server and the intermediary. In some embodiments the establishing of the SSL VPN session includes authentication of the first client. In some embodiments the intermediary or the server requires the first client to be authenticated using a username a password or a combination of the username and the password in order to establish the first session. In many embodiments the server and the first client use encryption key to establish a secure encrypted first session.

During or upon the establishing of the first SSL VPN session the server or the intermediary may use a policy and or a policy engine to associate the first client with a level of access to the server or level of access to the functionalities of the server. In many embodiments during or upon establishing of the SSL VPN session the server or the intermediary uses one or more configured policies of a user group or globally to associate the first client with a level of access to the server or the level of access to the functionalities of the server.

At step any one of the client server or the intermediary establishes a second SSL VPN session between a second client and the server via the intermediary. In some embodiments the second session is established using the same set of steps as the first session. In many embodiments the second session is established substantially similarly to the way the first session is established. The second SSL VPN session may be assigned a unique second identifier for uniquely identifying the second SSL VPN session from other SSL VPN sessions. In many embodiments the second SSL VPN session comprises any portion or any functionality of the first SSL VPN session. In some embodiments the second SSL VPN session is established using an encryption key different from the encryption key used to establish the first SSL VPN session. The second SSL VPN session may be established using a same encryption key as the key used for the first SSL VPN session. In a number of embodiments the second SSL VPN session is established using authentication from the second client such as authentication via a username and a password. In some embodiments the second SSL VPN session is established using a handshake between any two of the second client intermediary or the server.

During or upon the establishing of the second SSL VPN session the server or the intermediary may use a policy and or a policy engine to associate the second client with a level of access to the server or level of access to the functionalities of the server. In many embodiments the server or the intermediary uses one or more configured policies of a user group or globally to associate the second client with a level of access to the server or the level of access to the functionalities of the server. In some embodiments during or upon establishing of the SSL VPN session the server or the intermediary uses a policy or a rule engine to associate the first client with a level of security of the first client or the level of threat a session with the first client may pose. In a plurality of embodiments the server or the intermediary uses a policy policy engine or rules to determine eligibility of the first client to establish the first SSL VPN session with the server.

At step a packet engine of the intermediary receives via the first SSL VPN session a first response from the first client comprising a first URL from the server to the client. In some embodiments any component of the intermediary receives the first response. The first response may be transmitted to the intermediary from the server directly or from the server via any number of other intermediaries. The packet engine or any other component of the intermediary may receive any number of responses from the server comprising the first URL. In some embodiments the first response received by the intermediary includes a plurality of URLs from the server to the client.

In some embodiments the intermediary receives a URL path to the content of the resource webpage file application or a resource made available only to clients or users which are establishing SSL VPN sessions from secured network or from a network environment recognized as secure by the intermediary or the server.

At step the packet engine of the intermediary receives a second response from the second client comprising a second URL from the server to the client via the second SSL VPN session. The second response may be substantially similar to the first response and it may comprise all the features functionalities or characteristics of the first response. In many embodiments the second URL same as the first URL and in other embodiments the second URL is different from the first URL. In some embodiments any component of the intermediary receives the second response. The second response may be transmitted to the intermediary from the server directly or from the server via any number of other intermediaries. The packet engine or any other component of the intermediary may receive any number of responses from the server comprising the second URL.

At step a policy engine uses an encoding policy to determine a first encoding scheme from a plurality of encoding schemes for the first URL and a second encoding scheme from the plurality of encoding schemes for encoding the second URL. In a number of embodiments the encoding policy determines that the first encoding scheme for encrypting a portion of the first URL is to be used for the first URL and that the second encoding scheme for not modifying the second URL is to be used for the second URL. In a number of embodiments the encoding policy determines that the first encoding scheme for rewriting of a portion of the first URL is to be used for the first URL and that the second encoding scheme for deleting of a portion of the second URL is to be used for the second URL. In a variety of embodiments the encoding policy determines that the first encoding scheme for overwriting of a portion of the first URL with another made up URL is to be used for the first URL and that the second encoding for obfuscating a portion of the second URL is to be used for the second URL. In some embodiments the encoding policy determines that the first encoding scheme for modifying of a portion of the first URL is to be used for the first URL and that a second encoding scheme for modifying the entire second URL is to be used for the second URL.

Sometimes at step the policy engine may use information status or credentials of a client to determine the encoding scheme for a URL. In some embodiments the policy engine uses an encoding policy relating the security of the first or the second client to determine the first encoding scheme for the first client or the second encoding scheme for the second client. In many embodiments the policy engine uses an encoding policy relating the level of security of the network the first client or the second client is connecting from to determine the first encoding scheme for the first client or the second encoding scheme for the second client. In various embodiments the policy engine uses the level of access the client is granted by the intermediary or by the server for accessing or using applications files or resources on the server in order to determine the encoding scheme of the URL of the client. In some embodiments the policy engine uses the information relating a type of a computer or a network device the first client uses for communication with server to determine the first encoding scheme for the first URL of the first client. Similarly the policy engine may use the information relating a type of a computer or a network device the second client uses for communication with server to determine the second encoding scheme for the second URL of the second client.

In some embodiments at step the policy engine determines the encoding scheme for the first or the second URL based on any one of or a combination of a status of the user authenticated on the client in terms of accessibility of the user to server s resources a client s internet protocol address a history of the client or the history of the user on the client security level of the network the client is communicating from and the username and the password provided by the client during the authentication. In some embodiments the policy engine determines the encoding scheme for the first or the second client based on the client s software application or a client s geographical location. In some embodiments the policy engine determines the encoding scheme for the first or the second client based on statistics gathered by the server or the intermediary from previous communications with that client. In a number of embodiments the policy engine determines the encoding scheme for the first or the second client based on the sensitivity confidentiality or the importance of the information shared with the first or the second client. For example the policy engine uses an encoding policy to determine that the first encoding scheme involves obfuscating and encrypting the first URL in response to recognizing the first URL as comprising sensitive or confidential information. Similarly the policy engine uses encoding policy to determine that the second scheme involves not modifying the second URL in response to recognizing that the second URL does not comprise any sensitive or confidential information. The policy engine may also use the encoding policy to determine that the first encoding scheme or the second encoding scheme involves any one of or any combination of rewriting of the first or second URLs with a fake URL disguising or obfuscating at least a portion of the first or second URL translating the first or the second URL into another URL and including one or more codes code words and portions of random data into the first or the second URL.

At step a rewriter of the intermediary responsive to the policy engine rewrites the first URL in accordance with the determined first encoding scheme and rewrites the second URL in accordance with the determined second encoding scheme. In many embodiments any component of the intermediary rewrites any one of the first or the second URL in accordance with determined first or second encoding schemes. In some embodiments the rewriter rewrites or modifies only the first URL or the second URL. In many embodiments the rewriter in response to the type of encoding scheme selected by the intermediary rewrites modifies encrypts encodes or obfuscates the first URL and the second URL. In some embodiments the rewriter encodes or encrypts a portion of the first or the second URL according to the first encoding scheme or the second encoding scheme. In some embodiments the rewriter uses an encrypter or decrypter for encrypting a portion of the first or the second URL using one or more encryption keys selected by the encoding scheme or the rewriter. In many embodiments the rewriter is a device unit function or a component of the intermediary modifying the first URL the second URL or the first URL and the second URL as instructed by the policy engine. In some embodiments the rewriter modifies the first URL as instructed by the first encoding scheme from the policy engine and modifies the second URL as instructed by the second encoding scheme from the policy engine. In a number of embodiments the rewriter receives instructions for modifying the first URL and the second URL from the policy engine or the encoding policy. The rewriter may overwrite rewrite delete encrypt decrypt replace obfuscate or otherwise modify in any way the first URL the second URL or any other URL received as instructed by the policy engine or the encoding policy.
