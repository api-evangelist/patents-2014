One entity may send a message to another entity for delivery by a designated type of single communication channel. Using a single communication channel for delivery of the message may have an increased risk of the message not being delivered or not being delivered timely i.e. being delivered late for example due to any incident along the delivery chain. It may desirable to develop systems and techniques for more reliable delivery of messages.

According to one general aspect a system includes a gateway that is configured to receive a message from a source for transmission to a destination and multiple communication channels on which to transmit the message to the destination where the communication channels include different types of communication channels. The system includes a decision engine that is operably coupled to the gateway and the communication channels. The decision engine is configured to select a first communication channel from the communication channels to route the message for transmission to the destination. The decision engine is configured to select a second communication channel from the communication channels to route the message for transmission to the destination in response to a period of time expiring without receiving an acknowledgement from the destination via the first communication channel where the second communication channel is a different type of communication channel than the first communication channel.

In another general aspect a computer implemented method includes executing instructions stored on a non transitory computer readable storage medium. The method includes receiving a message from a source for transmission to a destination. The method includes selecting a first communication channel from multiple communication channels to route the message for transmission to the destination where the communication channels include different types of communication channels. The method includes selecting a second communication channel from the communication channels to route the message for transmission to the destination in response to a period of time expiring without receiving an acknowledgement from the destination via the first communication channel where the second communication channel is a different type of communication channel than the first communication channel.

In another general aspect a system includes a gateway that is configured to receive a message from a source for transmission to a mobile device running a mobile application and at least two communication channels on which to transmit the message to the mobile device including a web socket communication channel and a second communication channel that is different than the web socket communication channel. The system includes a decision engine that is operably coupled to the gateway and the at least two communication channels where the decision engine includes a storage module for storing routing information that is unique to the mobile device for the web socket communication channel and the second communication channel where the routing information is different for the web socket communication channel and the second communication channel. The decision engine is configured to determine if a connection is active between the web socket communication channel and the mobile device prior to selecting the web socket communication channel select the web socket communication channel to route the message for transmission to the mobile device if the connection is active and select the second communication channel to route the message for transmission to the mobile device if the connection is not active. If the message was first transmitted using the web socket communication channel the decision engine is configured to select the second communication channel to route the message for transmission to the mobile device in response to a period of time expiring without receiving an acknowledgement from the mobile device via the web socket communication channel.

The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

This document relates generally to systems and techniques for telecommunications services. More specifically this document relates to systems and techniques for enhanced real time messaging for sending a message from a source to a destination through a system that is configured to route the message for transmission over at least one of multiple different communication channels. The communication channel may be selected based upon one or more rules. The selected communication channel may include an acknowledgment that the message was delivered to the destination. If an acknowledgment is not received within a configurable period of time the system may route the message for transmission on a different communication channel. Other criteria including for example presence information time preferences and geographic location may be used to determine if and when to route the message for transmission on a different communication channel.

The source may initiate the sending of a message to the destination . The source may represent any type of computing device that is configured to send and or receive messages. The source is representative of any computing device and or entity at which the computing device is located prior to receipt of the message at the intermediary . While in this example the source is illustrated as a single block the source is representative of multiple different sources that communicate messages through the intermediary to one or more different destinations.

In some implementations the source may designate whether a message or messages originating from the source are communicated through the intermediary . The source may directly send a message or messages to the intermediary for routing to and or delivery to the destination . Other messages from the source may not be routed through the intermediary . In this manner the source may control whether or not the messages to the destination are communicated through the intermediary . Of course other implementations are possible including for example all messages originating from the source may be communicated through the intermediary . Also the intermediary may be capable or configured to intercept some or all messages originating from the source for routing and delivery to the destination . Additionally and or alternatively an entity other than the source may be capable of or configured to control which messages originating from the source are communicated through the intermediary .

In a similar manner the destination may be capable of receiving the message sent by the source through the intermediary . The destination may represent any type of computing device that is configured to receive and or send messages. The destination is representative of any computing device and or entity at which the computing device is located that receives the delivered message as routed by the intermediary . While in this example the destination is illustrated as a single block the destination is representative of multiple different destinations that receive messages through the intermediary from one or more different sources.

The intermediary is configured to receive the message from the source and to route the message on one or more communication channels for delivery to the destination . The intermediary includes options for routing and delivery of the message using different types of communications channels. Further as discussed above the communications between the source and the destination may be bi directional. Thus the intermediary is configured to receive messages from the destination for delivery to the source .

In some example implementations the intermediary may function as a bridge or a hub between the source and the destination . Also as mentioned above the intermediary may support message routing and delivery of messages from multiple different sources to multiple different destinations. The intermediary may be scalable to accommodate providing the routing delivery and other message related services between multiple different sources and multiple different destinations.

The intermediary includes a gateway multiple communication channels and a decision engine . The gateway is configured to receive a message from the source . The gateway may function as an interface between the source and the other components of the intermediary for the initial receipt and handling of incoming messages.

The gateway may be configured to handle one or more different types of protocols to receive incoming messages from the source . In one example implementation the gateway may include a hypertext transport protocol HTTP or secure hypertext transport protocol HTTPS gateway to receive messages from the source using an HTTP protocol. Other protocols including the short message peer to peer SMPP protocol and the simple mail transfer protocol SMTP also may be included as part of the gateway such that the gateway may include multiple different protocols for enabling the receipt of messages using different protocols. It is understood that other types of protocols may be used to communicate the message from the source for receipt by the gateway and the gateway is programmed or programmable to receive message using being sent using the other types of protocols.

The communication channels include different types of channels or paths on which to communicate the message from the intermediary to the destination . The intermediary is scalable to handle multiple different types of communication channels. Examples of the different types of communication channels include a socket based e.g. web socket communication channel a short message service SMS communication channel an enhanced message service EMS communication channel a multimedia messaging service MMS communication channel an application oriented communication channel an instant messaging IM communication channel an electronic mail e mail communication channel a voice communication channel and social media channels. It is understood that these examples are not meant to limit the number or type of communication channels available in the intermediary and that other communication channel types may be included.

In one example implementation the intermediary at least include two communication channels a first communication channel and a second communication channel where the first communication channel is a different type of communication channel than the second communication channel . The first communication channel and the second communication channel may be different communication channel types selected from the examples described above. In this manner the intermediary has at least two different types of communication channels on which to route a message from the source to the destination .

In one example implementation the first communication channel may include a socket based communication channel such as a web socket communication channel. The socket based communication channel may provide push message or push notifications to the destination . The socket based communication channel may include one or more features to provide message transmission delivery to the destination . For instance one feature of the socket based communication channel is that there may be a unique secure channel established between the intermediary and the destination . The secure channel may be established using a unique channel identifier ID which is a shared ID between the intermediary and the destination . For the intermediary the unique channel ID may be stored for use in a storage module . The storage module may store the unique channel ID in a database or table for instance along with information that associates the unique channel ID with the particular destination such as a destination ID that can be used as part of a look up when sending messages to the particular destination.

Another feature of the socket based communication channel is that a connection between the intermediary and the destination may be established as a persistent connection. The persistent connection between the intermediary and the destination may be checked by the intermediary to determine if the connection is active prior to sending the message using this communication channel. If the connection is active then the socket based communication channel may be used to transmit the message to the destination . If the connection is not active then the second communication channel may be used to transmit the message to the destination .

Still another feature of the socket based communication channel is that it may provide bi directional communication between the intermediary and the destination . In this manner the destination may provide an acknowledgement of receipt of the message back to the intermediary . The intermediary may use the acknowledgement to determine whether or not the message should be transmitted or re transmitted using the second communication channel . For example if the intermediary receives the acknowledgment from the destination then the intermediary knows that the message was delivered successfully. The intermediary would not need to send the message again on a different communication channel. However if the intermediary does not receive an acknowledgement from the destination then the intermediary can re transmit the message on the second communication channel . In some implementations the intermediary may wait a configurable period of time for the acknowledgement before re sending the message using the second communication channel

In the example implementation where the first communication channel is a socket based communication channel the second communication channel may be any of the other types of communication channels previously described. In one implementation the second communication channel may be a SMS communication channel. In this example the destination may be a computing device capable of receiving SMS messages including for example a mobile device such as a mobile phone. The intermediary may store information needing to send an SMS message to the destination in the storage module .

If the device is a mobile phone the information may include a mobile phone number that is stored in the storage module and associated with the particular destination . The mobile phone number may be collected by the intermediary as part of a registration process with the destination as discussed in more detail below. The information may be stored along with information needed to communicate with the destination using the other communication channels including the unique channel ID for socket based communications. The communication information associated with a particular destination may be part of a destination profile that is stored in the storage module in a database table or other storage means that enables a look up of the information for use in delivery of messages to the destination .

As discussed above if the intermediary first attempts to deliver the message using the socket based communication channel and no acknowledgement is received from the destination within a period of time then the intermediary may send the message using the SMS communication channel. In this manner the source has the benefit of multiple channels of communication to the destination through the intermediary where the source only needs to transmit the message one time. The intermediary then processes the message for routing including using multiple different communication channels to transmit the message to the destination .

In one example one of the communication channels may be a voice communication channel. For instance the voice communication channel may be the first communication channel the second communication channel or one of the other communication channels . A message such as a text message may be sent from a source for delivery to a destination such as a mobile subscriber using a mobile phone. The intermediary may receive the text message and convert the text message to an audio message for transmission to the destination . The intermediary may select the voice communication channel for delivery of the converted text to audio message using a mobile phone number of the mobile subscriber. That is the intermediary may initiate a call to the mobile subscriber and transmit the audio of the text message to the mobile subscriber using the voice communication channel. The voice communication channel may be utilized as designated by the source for designated messages and or as designated by the destination in preferences and or by capability to receive such messages over the voice communication channel.

The intermediary may send deliver receipts to the source to notify the source of the of which communication channels were attempted and which channels were successful in delivering the message. In this manner the source is informed of the message status in terms of the communication channels attempted and the ones that were successfully delivered.

The intermediary includes the decision engine . The decision engine is operably coupled to the gateway and to the communication channels . The decision engine may include logic and or algorithms to determine the selection and routing of the message on the various different communication channels. The decision engine may access and use the information stored in the storage module to assist in the routing decisions.

The decision engine may be configured to operate in various manners. In one implementation the decision engine may be configured to select the first communication channel to route the message for transmission to the destination . If an acknowledgement is not received within a period of time then the decision engine may select the second communication channel to route the message for transmission to the destination . In this manner the lack of an acknowledgement triggers the decision engine to select a different communication channel on which to re transmit the message to help ensure successful delivery of the message to the destination .

In other implementations the decision engine may be configured to check for an active connection between the first communication channel and the destination prior to selecting and routing the message using the first communication channel . If the connection is determined to be active then the decision engine selects and routes the message to the first communication channel . The decision engine may follow the process described above with respect to receiving an acknowledgement to determine whether or not the message may need to be re transmitted on a different communication channel. If the connection is not active then the decision engine selects and routes the message to the second communication channel

In some implementations the decision engine may select and route the message to the destination on multiple communication channels simultaneously for instance using both the first communication channel and the second communication channel . The decision engine may use information from the source the destination or message type information all as may be stored in the storage module to determine whether to send the message on multiple communication channels simultaneously.

In other implementations the decision engine may use other information provided by collected from or otherwise attainable about the destination in order to select and route the message using one or more of the communication channels . For instance the destination may provide communication channel preferences and other preferences e.g. day of week details time of day details presence information geographic location preferences etc. that the decision engine may take into account when selecting and routing the message. Also the decision engine may use location based information for the destination to determine on which communication channel s to route the message for transmission to the destination .

The intermediary also may include an optional security module . The security module may be used to provide security to the messages such as encryption authentication authorization and access AAA prior to the message being transmitted to the destination . Various different encryption protocols may be implemented and used to secure the transmission of the messages. Each of the communication channels may have its own unique channel ID as discussed above and each unique channel ID may include its own set of unique authorization and cipher keys.

Referring to an example flowchart illustrates a process for example operations of the system of . Process includes receiving a message from a source for transmission to a destination . For example with reference to a gateway at the intermediary is configured to receive a message from a source for transmission to a destination .

Process includes selecting a first communication channel from multiple communication channels to route the message for transmission to the destination where the communication channels include different types of communication channels . For example with reference to the decision engine at the intermediary is configured to select a first communication channel from multiple communication channels to route the message for transmission to the destination . The multiple communication channels include different types of communication channel as discussed above with respect to .

The decision engine may default to select the first communication channel to route the message. The decision engine also may use rules or criteria to determine which communication channel to select to route the message where the rules and or other criteria may be stored in the storage module . The selection rules are discussed in more detail below with respect to .

Process includes selecting a second communication channel from the communication channels to route the message for transmission to the destination in response to a period of time expiring without receiving an acknowledgement from the destination via the first communication channel where the second communication channel is a different type of channel than the first communication channel . For example with reference to the decision engine at the intermediary is configured to select the second communication channel to route the message for transmission to the destination in response to a period of time expiring without receiving an acknowledgement from the destination via the first communication channel . The second communication channel is a different type of communication channel than the first communication channel

In one example implementation the first communication channel is a socket based communication channel and the second communication channel is a SMS communication channel. The decision engine first selects the socket based communication channel to route the message to the destination which may be a mobile phone device. If the mobile phone device which may be running a mobile application that is configured to send and receive messages does not acknowledge receipt of the message sent over the socket based communication channel then the decision engine may select the SMS communication channel to send the message to the mobile phone.

The decision engine may wait a configurable period of time for the acknowledgement. If the acknowledgement is received within the configurable period of time then the decision engine does not need to select the second communication channel to route the message. If the acknowledgement is not received within the configurable period of time then the decision engine selects the second communication channel to route the message. Of course it is understood that the decision engine may use rules or other criteria to select a different communication channel other than the second communication channel on which to route the message when an acknowledgement is not received. Also the decision engine may select multiple communication channels on which to route the message when an acknowledgement is not received.

The process illustrated in may be used by various types of sources and destinations. In one example implementation the source may include a service provider such as a bank Internet service provider or other provider that uses a two factor authentication process to enable access to services of the provider. Process may be used as a portion of the two factor authentication process to send a one time artifact from the source through the intermediary to the destination. In this manner the process helps to ensure timely and successful delivery of the message i.e. the one time artifact from the source to the destination using one or more of the communication channels as may be appropriate.

For example a bank customer may install a web application on a mobile device. The mobile device for the customer may correspond to the destination . The web application may enable the customer to register for push notifications which enables the customer to receive alerts on both push notification and SMS channels. In this example the push notifications may include a web socket based communication channel. The customer using the web application on the mobile device may register for the push notifications which enables the bank as the source to send messages through the intermediary using both push notification channels and SMS channels.

In one example when the customer attempts a transaction which requires a two factor authentication the bank sends an HTTPS request to the intermediary . The decision engine processes the message which performs a check to see if the customer has registered to receive push notifications. The decision engine may perform a look up in the storage module to check for the push notification registration.

If the customer has registered for push notifications and the mobile device is active the decision engine will dispatch the message using the push notifications channel to the customer s mobile application on the mobile device. If the customer has not registered for push notifications or is not currently reachable e.g. the push notification communication channel is not active then the decision engine will dispatch the message using the SMS communication channel.

Referring to an example flowchart illustrates a process for example operations of the system of . Process includes receiving a message from a source for transmission to a destination . For example with reference to a gateway at the intermediary is configured to receive a message from a source for transmission to a destination .

Process includes determining whether the first communication channel is a preferred communication channel in response to receiving a message . Determining whether or not the first communication channel is a preferred channel may include looking up a preferences or rules table to make the preference determination. For example the storage module may store a table that includes communication channel preferences that may take into account communication channel preferences of the destination and or the source . The communication channel preferences may include preferences related to time of week time of day geographic location presence or active connection and other factors. The decision engine may look up the communication preferences in the storage module and determine which of the communication channels may be used. In one implementation the communication channel preferences may be collected and stored in the storage module during a registration process as discussed in more detail below.

If the first communication channel is not the preferred communication channel then a second communication channel is selected to route the message for transmission to the destination . For example with reference to if the decision engine determines the first communication channel is not the preferred communication channel then the decision engine selects the second communication channel to route the message for transmission to the destination .

If the first communication channel is the preferred communication channel process includes determining if a connection is active between a first communication channel and the destination prior to selecting the first communication channel . For example with reference to the decision engine may determine if a connection is active between the first communication channel and the destination prior to selecting the first communication channel to send the message. In one example implementation the first communication channel may be a socket based communication channel which is a persistent and secure channel with the destination . The decision engine checks to see that the connection is active and not dormant or disconnected before select and routing the message to the first communication channel . While process illustrates the decision block prior to the decision block it is to be understood that the order of the decision blocks and may be switched and or performed nearly simultaneously.

Process includes selecting the second communication channel to route the message for transmission to the destination if the connection is not active . For example with reference to if the decision engine determines the connection is not active between the first communication channel and the destination even if the first communication channel is the preferred communication channel then the decision engine does not select the first communication channel and instead selects the second communication channel . While process describes the making a selection between a first communication channel and a second communication channel it is to be understood that the selection may include other communication channels as well.

If the first communication channel is the preferred communication channel or at least the default communications channel and the first communication channel is active then the first communication channel is selected to route the message for transmission to the destination . For example with reference to the decision engine may select the first communication channel to route the message for transmission to the destination .

Process includes determining whether or not an acknowledgement was received from the destination . The acknowledgment may include a return message from the destination to the intermediary via the first communication channel. The acknowledgement provides an indication to the intermediary that the message was successfully delivered to the destination. If the acknowledgement was received then a deliver receipt may be sent to the source . The deliver receipt may be a message from the intermediary to the source that indicates the communication channels over which the message was attempted and the communication channels over which delivery was successful or unsuccessful.

If no acknowledgement is received then the second communication channel may be selected to route the message for transmission to the destination. For example the decision may select the second communication channel to route the message for transmission to the destination if an acknowledgement is not received from the destination within a pre determined period of time.

Referring to an example block diagram illustrates a system . The system is an example implementation of the system of . The system also may perform the process and of respectively. The system provides an illustrative framework for an example implementation of the system and more specifically of the intermediary of .

As a Mobile Subscriber MS for example a user of a Wireless Device WD such as inter alia a smartphone a tablet computer etc. goes about her daily activities she may encounter any number of instances where she will engage in an activity e.g. a financial transaction where she would like to enhance the security of that activity. For example the MS 1 She may wish to determine the balance of one of her bank brokerage credit card etc. accounts 2 She may wish to complete the payment portion of a purchase from for example an on line retailer etc. 3 She may wish to transfer money between various of her bank brokerage credit card etc. accounts transfer money from one of her bank brokerage credit card etc. accounts to someone else transfer money to someone else perhaps another MS with the amount of the transfer along with for example charges fees etc. appearing on her Wireless Carrier WC statement etc.

The specific examples that were presented above are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other examples are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present disclosure.

The system includes an intermediary which also may be referred to as an Inter Carrier Vendor ICV . The ICV may correspond to the intermediary of and perform the functions as described above with respect to intermediary .

The ICV may for example be realized through any combination of possibly inter alia any one or more of 1 an element of a WC an element of a landline carrier or multiple such elements working together 2 a Third Party 3P such as possibly inter alia a merchant a Content Provider CP such as for example a news organization an advertising agency a brand etc. a Service Provider SP such as for example a bank a financial institution a provider of mobile services etc. etc. 3 multiple 3P entities working together 4 a service bureau 5 a message service provider and or 6 other entities.

As illustrated in the system includes an ICV which may be disposed between possibly inter alia multiple WCs WC WC WCz on one side and multiple SPs SP SPz on the other side and is in effect a horizontally and vertically scalable hub that may among other things bridge all of the connected entities. Additional entities such as inter alia CPs may also connect to an ICV .

The ICV thus as one simple example may offer various routing formatting delivery value add etc. capabilities that provide possibly inter alia 

1 A WC WC WCz and by extension all of the Mobile Subscribers MSs such as MS MSa MS MS MS MS that are serviced by the WC WC WC with ubiquitous access to a broad universe of SPs SP SP and

2 A SP SP SP with ubiquitous access to a broad universe of WCs WC WC and by extension to all of the MSs MS MS MS MS MS MS that are serviced by the WCs WC WC .

Generally speaking an ICV may have varying degrees of visibility e.g. access etc. to the MS MS MS SP etc. data roaming messaging voice signaling etc. traffic.

A WC may elect to route just their out of network traffic to the ICV . Under this approach the ICV would have visibility e.g. access etc. to just the portion of the WC s traffic that was directed to the ICV by the WC.

A WC may elect to route all of their traffic to the ICV . The ICV may possibly among other things subsequently return to the WC that portion of the traffic that belongs to i.e. that is destined for an entity of the WC. Under this approach the ICV would have visibility e.g. access etc. to all of the WC s traffic.

While the discussion below may reference an ICV it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other implementation arrangements are equally applicable and indeed are fully within the scope of the present disclosure.

As just one example of an alternative arrangement aspects of the solution may be offered by a SP. A SP may for example be realized through any combination of possibly inter alia any one or more of 1 an element of a WC an element of a landline carrier an element of a ICV or multiple such elements working together 2 a 3P such as possibly inter alia a merchant a CP such as for example a news organization an advertising agency a brand etc. a financial institution etc. 3 multiple 3P entities working together 4 a service bureau 5 a message service provider and or 6 other entities.

Referring to an example block diagram illustrates a system . The system is an example implementation of the system of and the system of . The system also may perform the process and of respectively. The system provides an illustrative framework for an example implementation of the system and more specifically of the intermediary of where intermediary or ICV performs the functions of intermediary of .

While the discussion above referred to one specific alternative arrangement it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other alternative arrangements including inter alia the use of multiple SPs the sharing blending etc. of functionality between an ICV and one or more SPs etc. are equally applicable and indeed are fully within the scope of the present solution.

For simplicity of exposition portions of the discussion below will include a single ICV. As noted above it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other arrangements are easily possible e.g. any combination of one or more of inter alia a single ICV multiple ICVs a single SP multiple SPs etc. .

Aspects of the present solution may incorporate one or more repositories within which various pieces of information such as for example definitional data artifacts of processing etc. may be deposited updated managed extracted reported on etc.

Aspects of the present solution may incorporate a delivery channel SMS messaging EMS messaging MMS messaging electronic mail a socket based paradigm IM etc. selection process that may leverage any combination of one or more of inter alia rules regarding for example timeouts delays etc. logic repositories workflows and workflow engines user preference information that may for example be collected during a user registration process and which may comprise day of week details time of day details location details security requirements thresholds etc. information on the physical location of the user via their device requirements etc. regarding the quanta of data such as inter alia importance expiration time etc. quality of service constraints etc.

Referring to an example flow diagram illustrates various of the exchanges or interactions that might occur under an optional registration portion of the present solution. Such a registration process may be tailored e.g. the range of information gathered the scope of services subsequently offered etc. to the class of user e.g. possibly inter alia different types categories etc. of users may complete different registration processes. Additionally a registration process may be supported or offered by any combination of one or more entities e.g. a 3P such as a financial institution a retail establishment an on line retailer an employer a utility company etc. a SP etc. . As well some or all of the information that is collected during a registration process may be shared or exchanged between any combination of one or more entities e.g. a SP a 3P etc. . Thus a MS may complete a required or optional registration process with any number of entities and aspects of the information that is collected during a given registration process may be shared or exchanged between any number of entities. The illustrative registration process that is depicted through is supported or offered by a SP specifically by SP .

ICV . An ICV although not required provides significant advantages where intermediary or ICV performs the functions of intermediary of .

SP Billing Interface BI . A single consolidated interface that SP may use to easily reach possibly inter alia one or more internal and or external entities such as a credit card or debit card clearinghouse a carrier billing system a service bureau that provides access to multiple carrier billing systems invoicing or billing facilities etc.

SP Gateway GW which is a facility through which SP may exchange possibly inter alia SMS MMS etc. messages application directives HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP or equivalent data etc. with possibly inter alia an ICV .

It is important to note that while in the MS WD and MS PC entities are illustrated as being adjacent or otherwise near each other in actual practice the entities may for example be physically located anywhere. Additionally numerous alternative registration approaches are easily possible involving inter alia different components e.g. one alternative approach may not include MS PC component arrangements and or interactions.

In the exchanges that are collected under the designation Set represent the activities that might take place as Mary completes a registration process with SP 

A Mary uses one of her PCs to visit a WS of SP to possibly among other things complete a service registration process see .

B AWS of SP interacts with an AS of SP to possibly among other things commit some or all of the information that Mary provided to one or more data repositories e.g. a databases optionally initiate a billing transaction etc. see .

D After receiving a response from an AS of SP a WS of SP responds appropriately e.g. with the presentation of a confirmation message etc. see .

The specific exchanges that were described above as residing under the designation Set are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other exchanges are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention. For example the collected information may be reviewed confirmed etc. through one or more manual and or automatic mechanisms. For example the registration process may be completed through any combination of one or more channels including inter alia the WWW wireless messaging SMS MMS etc. e mail messages IM conventional mail telephone an Interactive Voice Response IVR facility etc.

During the registration process described above a range of information may be captured from a MS including possibly inter alia 

A Identifying Information. For example possibly among other things name address age landline and wireless Telephone Numbers TNs e mail addresses IM names identifiers a unique identifier and a password etc.

B Account Information. For example possibly among other things various of the particulars for one or more of a MS accounts with organizations such as possibly inter alia utility companies financial institutions on line retailers etc. . The particulars may include possibly inter alia organization name and contact details account number account access credentials etc.

C Security Information. For example possibly among other things the selection of one or more of the different security plans programs etc. that a SP may optionally offer each of which may carry possibly inter alia some type of fee or charge .
