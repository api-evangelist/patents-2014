The present disclosure generally relates to wireless sensor networks and in an embodiment to cooperative security in wireless sensor networks.

A wireless sensor network WSN is a network of wireless nodes equipped with sensors to monitor physical or environmental conditions such as temperature air pressure flow rate sound pressure etc. A wireless node transmits the data collected by its sensor to a destination. In an example the wireless node may pass the data to another wireless node that is closer either physically or logically to the destination than the originating wireless node this process continues until the data is delivered to the destination.

In the following detailed description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various aspects of the presently disclosed subject matter. However it will be to those skilled in the art that the presently disclosed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known methods procedures and components have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the presently disclosed subject matter.

The use of wireless sensor networks is increasing rapidly in a variety of applications including in industrial settings such as manufacturing supply chain and energy production distribution. Furthermore the quantity of wireless sensor nodes e.g. devices in deployments of wireless sensor networks continues to increase. It is common for some wireless sensor networks to have hundreds or even thousands of wireless sensor nodes. As the quantity of wireless sensor nodes increases identifying nodes that have been compromised e.g. by virus malware etc. becomes increasingly complex. Accurately identifying compromised nodes while managing false positives in a timely manner may become a significant challenge.

As the quantity of wireless sensor nodes increases wireless sensor nodes of wireless sensor networks may police themselves in an intelligent manner to 1 reduce the computing resources expended by backend centralized facilities 2 leverage commonality of function and proximity of devices to reduce network traffic and 3 minimize false positive alerts. These objectives may be met by a cooperative security model that allows distributed wireless sensor nodes to pattern the expected behavior of nodes within the network and to react appropriately to deviations from the expected behavior.

In an embodiment wireless sensor nodes including nodes at the edges of the wireless sensor network work in a cooperative manner to identify a compromised node and mitigate its chance of compromising other wireless sensor nodes in the network whether upstream or downstream from the compromised node. The wireless sensor nodes cooperatively organize themselves into clusters and each cluster chooses a leader node. The leader node uses machine learning techniques to create a model of expected behaviors of the nodes within its cluster and then uses the model of expected behaviors to decide whether the observed behavior of a node within the cluster indicates that the node is compromised. The leader node compares observed behavior to the expected behavior and based on these observations determines that a wireless sensor node within its cluster is compromised. Upon determining that a wireless sensor node within its cluster is compromised the leader mitigates the ability of the compromised node to compromise other nodes within the cluster.

In an embodiment a suspected wireless node that has been determined to be compromised may periodically be reevaluated. In an example the revaluation may be undertaken by a third party entity device. Such a reevaluation may ascertain whether the node is compromised via standard threat detection mechanisms. If the node passes the reevaluation the aberrant behavior may be attributed to proper emergent behavior based for example changed conditions.

In an embodiment a suspected wireless sensor node that has been determined to be compromised may object to this determination. In an embodiment the objection by suspected wireless sensor node triggers a proof operation. In an embodiment the proof operation includes the leader node of the cluster requesting a current description of the expected behaviors of suspected wireless sensor node and comparing the current description of expected behavior of suspected wireless sensor node to the previous description of expected behavior of suspected wireless sensor node if a difference is detected between the current and previous description of expected behavior the leader node reanalyzes the behavior of suspected wireless sensor node which lead to the determination that suspected wireless sensor node was compromised in light of the current description of expected behavior. In an embodiment if the reanalysis of the behavior of suspected wireless sensor node results in a determination that suspected wireless sensor node is not compromised the mitigation module clears suspected wireless sensor node of its compromised status and allows suspected wireless sensor node to continue operating.

In an embodiment wireless sensor node cooperates with the other wireless sensor nodes in the cluster to select a leader node for the cluster operation .

In an embodiment wireless sensor node describes the behaviors that are to be expected for wireless sensor node and makes its behavior descriptions available to the other wireless sensor nodes in its cluster operation .

In an embodiment where wireless sensor node is the leader node of its cluster wireless sensor node analyzes the actual behaviors of the other wireless sensor nodes in its cluster and detects a compromised wireless sensor node by comparing the actual behavior of the wireless sensor node to the description of the expected behavior for wireless sensor node operation .

In an embodiment where wireless sensor node is the leader node of its cluster wireless sensor node prevents a compromised wireless sensor node from compromising the other wireless sensor nodes in its cluster operation .

In an embodiment clusters of wireless sensor nodes within the wireless network organize themselves into a cluster of clusters or super cluster in the same way that wireless sensor nodes organize themselves into clusters. In an embodiment the clustering module and leader selection module of the leader node of the cluster cooperates with the clustering modules and leader selection modules of the leader nodes of other clusters to organize into a cluster of clusters. In an embodiment this process is recursive in that super clusters may organize with other clusters or other super clusters to form a larger super cluster.

In an embodiment clusters are organized hierarchically. For example the cluster hierarchy may be tree based linear or some combination thereof. In an embodiment a cluster is restricted to communicating with one or more downstream clusters and one or more upstream clusters. In an embodiment MAC VLAN filtering with ARP tables is used to restrict the communications of the cluster to its assigned upstream and downstream cluster s .

In an embodiment the upstream cluster starts the process of analyzing communications from downstream clusters operation . In an embodiment the upstream cluster obtains from a downstream cluster a data payload containing actual behavior for the downstream cluster operation .

In an embodiment the upstream cluster obtains the current description of expected behavior for the downstream cluster operation . In an embodiment the upstream cluster obtains the prior description of expected behavior for the downstream cluster operation . In an embodiment the upstream cluster determines operation whether the current description of expected behavior for the downstream cluster obtained at operation matches the prior description of expected behavior for the downstream cluster obtained at operation .

If the current description of expected behavior for the downstream cluster matches the prior description of expected behavior for the downstream cluster the upstream cluster proceeds to analyze operation the data payload obtained at operation . In an embodiment the upstream cluster utilizes one or more machine learning algorithms to analyze the data payload. In an embodiment the upstream cluster determines operation whether the data payload contains a behavioral anomaly. In an embodiment if an anomaly exists in the data payload the upstream cluster considers the downstream cluster to be compromised and mitigates the compromised downstream cluster operation and the process restarts operation . In an embodiment mitigating the downstream cluster includes causing the downstream cluster to reset itself to an uncompromised state e.g. each cluster in and each wireless sensor node in the downstream cluster is forced to reset to an uncompromised state . In an embodiment if an anomaly does not exist in the data payload the upstream cluster accepts the data payload and passes the data payload upstream to its upstream cluster.

In an embodiment if the upstream cluster determines operation that the current description of expected behavior for the downstream cluster does not match the prior description of expected behavior for the downstream cluster the upstream cluster determines operation the type of change in the current description of expected behavior. In an embodiment if the type of change is a data boundary change e.g. a range value for a data parameter has changed the upstream cluster causes the current description of expected behavior for the downstream cluster to be stored accepts the data payload and passes the data payload upstream to its upstream cluster operation and restarts process operation . In an embodiment if the type of change involves port behavior of the downstream cluster the upstream cluster considers the downstream cluster to be compromised and mitigates the compromised downstream cluster operation and the process restarts operation .

An additional approach for anomaly and threat detection is to use lockstep voting. For example in 2 in 3 lockstep voting leaders of three clusters compare their data and vote. If measurements from only two clusters are similar then the third cluster is determined to have an anomaly. The cluster with the anomaly will then be monitored by the other two clusters to determine whether the anomaly represents a one time error or a compromised cluster. In some such embodiments the cardinality e.g. quantity of nodes for each cluster is limited to a small quantity of nodes to allow such functionality. In an embodiment the voting is performed by all three cluster receiving data from the other two clusters computing the measurements and then exchanging their findings the two clusters that match are then allowed to report to an upstream cluster.

In an embodiment when a wireless sensor node within a cluster is the leader node machine learning algorithm within wireless sensor node enters training mode . In an embodiment machine learning algorithm obtains descriptions of expected behaviors from the wireless sensor nodes within its cluster operation . In an embodiment machine learning algorithm observes the network behaviors of each wireless sensor node within its cluster by storing the data transmitted from or to each wireless sensor node within its cluster operation .

In an embodiment machine learning algorithm proceeds to perform data analysis operation on the descriptions of expected behaviors obtained at operation and the stored data transmissions obtained at operation . In an embodiment the data analysis operation includes classification operation of samples from the stored data transmissions. In an embodiment the machine learning algorithm uses one or more statistical models in its data analysis. Some statistical models used by the machine learning algorithm include but are not limited to an amount or degree the data transmissions of the analyzed wireless sensor node deviate from the description of expected behavior for the analyzed wireless sensor node a proximity of the analyzed wireless sensor node to similar wireless sensor nodes the number of and or the nature of attempts by the analyzed wireless sensor node to probe other wireless sensor nodes the number and the type of ports open or closed on the analyzed wireless sensor node and the power recycle for analyzed wireless sensor node .

In an embodiment after the data analysis operation is complete machine learning algorithm stores the range boundaries operation output by the data analysis and exits training mode .
