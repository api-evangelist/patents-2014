title: Techniques for bypassing call screening in a call messaging system
abstract: Techniques for bypassing call screening in a call messaging system. In one embodiment, for example, a method performed by one or more computing devices comprises: receiving an incoming call from a device of a caller; determining whether a bypass condition exists for the incoming call; and in response to determining that the bypass condition exists, causing the incoming call to be connected to a device of a callee without performing a call screening action of a call screening rule that, based at least in part on one or more conditions of the call screening rule, applies to the incoming call.

No. 60 995 965 filed Sep. 28 2007 the entire contents of each of which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. The applicant s hereby rescind any disclaimer of claim scope in the parent application s or the prosecution history thereof and advise the USPTO that the claims in this application may be broader than any claim in the parent application s .

Embodiments of the invention relate generally to computing devices and systems as well as software computer programs applications and user interfaces and more particularly to filtering screening and dispatching calls in relation to a communication network for packetized and or synchronous communications including in situ filtering screening and dispatching of active calls.

Traditional phone handling techniques to handle an incoming call are limited in capability. Presently a callee typically screens a call through receipt of the caller s identification. A callee then has little flexibility when handling the call especially when the callee is already connected to another caller. To illustrate consider that a callee is connected to a first caller when a second caller rings through. Traditionally the callee interrupts the connected call with the first caller e.g. using call waiting technology to communicate with the second caller. Or the callee can allow the caller to pass to voice mail which is accessed by the callee after the second caller records a message.

While traditional techniques for call screening electronic messages and calls are functional there are certain drawbacks to these techniques. Call waiting technology is disruptive to communication. Further typical voicemail screening techniques add a time delay to determine the subject matter of voice message as a callee usually accesses the content of the voicemail after the caller has completed recording a message i.e. one way communication . The callee then dials or otherwise rings the caller to complete communication between the two parties. In some cases conventional approaches usually provide relatively rigid rules than enable a callee to enact predetermined call handling options.

It would be desirable to provide computing devices and systems as well as software computer programs applications and user interfaces that minimize one or more of the drawbacks associated with the conventional techniques for screening calls via packetized and or synchronous communication networks.

In one embodiment call rule configuration manager is configured to manage the modification of presentation rules in repository filtering rules in repository screening rules in repository and call dispatching rules in repository . Either system administrator at computing device or any of caller device callee device and callee device if authorized can interface with call rule configuration manager to modify the rules. Repository can include presenting rules such as do not disturb rules forward calls to a provisioned telephone number rules forward calls to an entered telephone number rules bypass forwarding call plans for the next call rules bypass forwarding call plans for some time duration rules bypass all forwarding call plans rules activate call routing plans from menu selections rules and the like. As an example a caller that is leaving a user a voice message can be presented with call routing plans customized according to their caller ID or to a personal identification number PIN . The caller can select a subsequent call routing plan from memory or can have the voice mail system play i.e. present visually or audibly available call routing plans whereby the caller selects either none one or multiple call routing plans from the presentations. According to at least some embodiments the term presentation rule can refer to a rule or a subset of processes for governing the presentation of call routing options or prompts to a user the options or prompts being useable to invoke filtering screening or dispatching processes.

Call rule configuration manager can be configured to manage the modification of filtering rules in repository according to one embodiment. According to at least some embodiments the term filtering rule can refer to a rule or a subset of processes for governing the filtering of a call based on user defined criteria that can invoke for example predetermined call routing prior to a call being received by callee devices or . In some instances a filtering rule can be applied to a call at call messaging system . In some embodiments filtering can include rejecting or forwarding a call based on predetermined rules. For example a user may apply a filtering rule to reject or forward all incoming calls do not disturb or may specify a time of day day of week caller ID or the like to selectively reject or forward incoming calls. A user can provision the call routing system to play specific messages to callers based upon the caller ID caller history the time of day the call frequency or from any combination of conditions.

Call rule configuration manager can be configured to manage the modification of screening rules in repository according to one embodiment. These rules can define default prompts and a user can replace or augment these with personal prompts to ask a caller to provide identification. For example consider that a caller to a telephone number has a menu played. The first menu item can be a prompt asking for the user name or the reason for this call or other information. The caller answers with some reason and this reason is played to the callee. By listening to the reason and viewing the caller ID the callee can decide how to dispatch this call. For example the following are applicable actions answer this call send this call to voice mail send this call to another agent and let callee or system default policies route this call. Note that speech recognition can evaluate and parse the caller reason for key words. Speech recognition of keywords can dispatch this call to user or system defined routing rules or to available agents. According to at least some embodiments the term screening rule can refer to a rule or a subset of processes for governing the screening of an active call at callee devices or . In some instances a screening rule can be applied to control which prompt or option can be presented and selected at callee devices or . For example screening rules can specify whether to present prompts or options to forward an active call send an active call to voice mail and listen to the voice message as it is being recorded communicate e.g. by way of selecting a response such as I will call you back with the caller initiating the active call without for example interrupting a connected call in which the callee is already participating and the like. A screening rule can be described as either a default screening rule or a customized screening rule. The term default screening rule can refer at least in some embodiments to predetermined rules that define how to screen calls prior to a callee device receiving a call whereas the term customized screening rule can refer at least in some embodiments to rules that dynamically can be implemented to screen calls as a call is received at a callee device without interrupting a pending other call.

Call rule configuration manager can be configured to manage the modification of call dispatching rules in repository according to one embodiment. According to at least some embodiments the term dispatching rule can refer to a rule or a subset of processes for governing the actions that can be initiated at callee devices or to dispatch an active call. In some instances a dispatching rule can be applied to control whether to perform any of the actions of forwarding an active call sending an active call to voice mail e.g. and listening to the voice message as it is being recorded communicating with the caller initiating the active call and the like. In particular repository can include rules relating to how to add prompts speech recognition and call dispatching rules to a user menu answer tree. The entire menu answer tree or parts of those rules can be reviewed edited saved from hosted web pages e.g. computing device client applications cell phone browsers and audio playback and edit routines. The menu answer tree and dispatching options can change with the time and date with the caller ID with callee availability and with scheduling tools such as a calendaring system. In some embodiments a dispatching action can be performed at callee device . In other embodiments a dispatching action can be performed at call messaging system or at a combination of elements shown in .

Screening engine can be configured to implement call screening in association with either callee or callee device according to one embodiment. For example when an inbound call rings a callee telephone the callee a potential destination answering endpoint can lift the handset and hear menu options. For example the callee might hear Caller name from telephone number is calling. Select 1 to answer 2 to send to voice mail 3 to play a response 4 to direct contact information to your PC client 5 to display contact history on your web browser. If the callee has information displayed on their computing device or via a web browser then the callee can view additional caller information by moving the PC mouse or other cursor over the caller name a contact directory or over a More Information or Help icon. The result can show caller information and caller history or call routing options or people available to accept this call. According to at least some embodiments screening engine can be configured to effect active call screening and dispatching. In some instances screening engine can be configured to perform one or more of the following present screening prompts at callee devices or receive a response or input from the callee via user inputs and perform an action to dispatch with the active call. According to at least some embodiments the functionalities and or structures of screening engine or portions thereof can be implemented in call messaging system callee device or callee device or a combination thereof. For purposes of describing the various embodiments of the invention the term active call can refer at least in some cases to a call made by a caller over any communications network such that a callee receives a notification for example a ringing signal that the call is pending but the call is not yet connected at the callee. Further the term active call also can refer to a call routed responsive to for example user inputs provided to a call messaging system in situ to screen and dispatch an incoming call. As used herein the term in situ can refer at least in some embodiments to initiating an action during the pendency of an 5 incoming call while for example an original connection with another active call is maintained interrupted i.e. a first call to a callee need not be interrupted by a second call that is yet to be connected . Thus an incoming call can be screened and dispatched without connecting to the incoming call and without interrupting the original connection with the other active call. For example call dispatching actions can be applied in situ to an active call being recorded as a voice message to listen to a voice message as it is recorded. In other examples call dispatching actions can connect the callee to the caller during the voice message recording and to do other similar actions.

In one embodiment call messaging system can be configured to enable a called party at callee device to override the default system filtering screening and call routing rules. For example call messaging system can implement a policy to block calls without caller ID or a policy to block call transfers during a time of day due to system activity or from some other combination of call dispatching policies. In some embodiments callee device can be configured to generate a prompt that if selected can override filtering rules e.g. predetermined filtering rules to dispatch an active call. In other embodiments call messaging system can be configured to enable a called party at callee device to override the user customized system filtering screening and call routing rules.

Depending upon the policies and system activity call messaging system can deliver to a caller options to leave voice mail or wait for an available endpoint. The caller can select the type of waiting such as to select 1 to have the first available person call back select 2 to listen to music and then select between or among subsequent options to select their preferred type of music and select 3 to leave voice mail. Call messaging system can park the caller inbound call in a media server or other servers configured to perform similar functions and can follow call routing rules such as a rule to notify one or more parties about the incoming call and to direct a party to pick up the call from a parked location that is transparent to the callee. Thus the call routing system can notify one or more parties about an incoming call thereby enabling the caller to be picked up without the callee knowing the parking method or parking slot that otherwise requires a caller to identify a specific extension or location at which to connect with the call.

In one embodiment a software application implementing a softphone can is able to carry out call answering and call dialing. For example when enabled the softphone can receive notification of an inbound call. Notifications can be for one specific user for a specific set of users or for a large group of users where a user is identified by one or more telephone numbers. Softphone can be configured to notify one or more callee s for all or a defined subset of incoming calls. For example a softphone may be used to notify a callee about incoming priority calls where priority is determined by time of day detected presence temporary duration policies and other policies. Depending upon the enabled policy softphone can display caller ID destination number contact name and information call routing options and other significant caller information. Additionally softphone can enable mouse over actions to display additional caller information such as a contact directory caller contact history call routing options and people available to accept this call. Softphone can be enabled to route incoming and parked calls. Softphone can also select announcements to play back for one or for a group of calls. Softphone can accept written text or text input by typing by selecting existing text or scraping a web site or a document for preferred text and then converting the text to speech. Selected and scraped text may be edited in the softphone before conversion to speech. Softphone can listen to voice mail in real time as it is being recorded. Thus softphone can act as a real time screening device and allows the user to interrupt a voice mail call to barge in and disconnect or talk with the caller. The user can stop softphone from listening to a recorded voice mail. Using softphone a user can monitor the status of active calls and can barge into an active call making a 3 way conference or the user can block the current callee from joining the conference. In addition the user can whisper i.e. communication to a subset of callees and callers in a multiple party call such as a teleconference to the callee without the caller hearing the whispered conversation.

Note that network can include packet networks and switched networks as well as any other suitable communications network. For example private and or public internet and switching networks can be used such as IP networks including protocols TCP UDP HTTP etc. and switched networks including public switched telephone networks PSTN or the like as well as cellular e.g. a digital cellular network short message service SMS and other wireless networks. 

Call messaging system can also include one or more configuration tools including a Web Server to configure the rules for filtering announcing routing and completing calls. A computing device as a system administrator or an authorized user can configure web server to modify call action rules stored for example in repositories and . As such computing device and or web server can maintain a Database or any other storage mechanism for storing system administrator rules and or end user defined rules. Examples of some tools that support inbound call processing and notification include client applications such as contact management appointment and calendar systems any of which can be found in for example an email program.

Database can store call history information for each inbound call including active call identifiers e.g. caller IDs to receive call status and send active call commands. For example database can maintain data representing a first party calling ID ANI a type of endpoint associated with the first calling party such as a PSTN phone a second destination endpoint DNIS a result code e.g. indicating a recipient status if the call was connected or not connected and the result of each prior call e.g. whether the previous call history includes no answers at callee device of . Database can also be configured to retain customer credit information satisfaction information and other customer profile information associated with each inbound caller ID. Database also can store call transfer conferencing recording and customer feedback information.

Call messaging system can include a database that maintains default inbound call routing rules as well as user defined call screening media server prompts call notification rules default and user defined dispatching rules. The Database can contain inbound call routing rule duration timers to apply routing rules for example during business and non business hours and the circuit switch or softswitch can apply the rule duration timer to each inbound call routing rule. The Database can collect call answering endpoint information and revise call routing rules to include those endpoints in future call routing rules when an inbound call includes a matching caller ID.

End users and can define and store in the Database custom call routing rules to augment or override the default call routing rules. Typically end users use the Web Server interface to define custom call routing rules. End users can also use a client application or the PSTN interface to configure and select custom call routing rules.

For each inbound call the circuit switch or softswitch applies the identified inbound caller ID ANI and the Database stored information and policies which can include caller history user defined call routing policies timers and endpoint presence status to filter and route the inbound call to a media server or to one or multiple endpoints and . From the identified inbound caller ID and any stored information associated with the caller the Database can assign a priority to the inbound call.

Additionally for each call routing the circuit switch or softswitch can access any of the default endpoint the saved ANI and the saved actual first calling endpoint and can apply all user defined routing rules simultaneously or sequentially to ring any or all of these stored endpoints. Also if the receiver is busy then for a high priority call the switch can facilitate a caller to barge in to connect the inbound call to a receiving endpoint and . Similarly a priority call can be conferenced into ongoing call endpoints.

In various embodiments call messaging system can provide a web interface a softphone default administrator configurations and user defined preferences to alert potential call receivers enabling them to make decisions concerning which calls to answer to redirect and to ignore. The Database can maintain system defined and user defined call data including prior call history the inbound call information including ANI DNIS CNAM caller contact information and other pertinent caller information. Embodiments of the invention can present any or all of this information to one or more potential call receivers allowing the receiver to choose whether to answer how to direct the call elsewhere and whether to ignore the inbound call.

Each user or the system administrator can allow or disallow a caller to barge in by interrupting an ongoing call to talk to one of the current call endpoints. As another option from the caller parameters and assigned priority the proposed system can add a call to an existing conference call. During any caller response analysis the system can park the inbound call at a media server or other device interface until the call disposition is decided and accepted by one or more call receivers. Further each end user and can listen as a caller leaves a voice mail message and elect among disconnecting the call from voice mail answering the call and disconnecting voice mail cancelling the call and dropping the call from voice mail and closing inbound call screening.

In operation screening engine can be configured to screen and dispatch an inbound call. While a call is active i.e. still pending communication device can present a subset of prompts in association with interface . The prompts provide a callee with various action options regarding the inbound call based on for example screening rules and call dispatching rules of . After callee selects from the various action options communication device can communicate with a call messaging system to implement the selected dispatching action or can perform the dispatching action itself. Prompt as a user input can be configured to provide in situ call forwarding. Upon detecting selection of prompt processor can execute instructions of the in situ call forwarding module to provide for call forwarding of an active call. For example in situ call forwarding module can provide for overriding of default filtering rules e.g. predetermine forwarding rules as well as for specifying a destination number to which a call can be forwarded in real time i.e. during the pendency of the active call .

Upon detecting selection of prompt processor can execute instructions of the in situ communication module to provide communication with the caller during an active call. For example in situ communication module can generate a response to the caller without the callee device e.g. communication device connecting with the caller device. In some instances the response can be selected as one of a number of responses to provide the caller with for example a predetermined voice response i.e. I will call you soon. . In at least one instance the response can be generated during the pendency of an active call e.g. the callee can enter text into interface that can be transmitted as text or as text to speech audio .

Upon detecting selection of prompt processor can execute instructions of the in situ voicemail screening module to provide for voice message screening of an active call by the callee during the recording of the voice message and optionally connecting with the caller during the recording of the voice message.

In some examples logic module can be configured to control panel generator to generate interfaces for implementing a call messaging system. Rendering engine can be configured to operate as a layout engine for web pages for example to manipulate both content e.g. as expressed in or including HTML XML image files etc. and formatting information e.g. as expressed in or including CSS XSL etc. for rendering the data or information as one or more panels on interface . Interface module can exchange panel presentation data including content data image data audio data as well as other data between application and another application e.g. a host client web services based distributed i.e. enterprise application programming interface API operating system program procedure or others that can use data and information generated from panel generator to render presented panels or windows on a display screen. In other examples the above described techniques and elements can be varied in design implementation and function and are not limited to the descriptions provided.

Data bus can be implemented to communicate data over a given port between application and interface module display module rendering module and repository . In some instances application can be implemented as a standalone application or as a component i.e. module of another application. Data or information including for example data for describing one or more attributes of a call responses communicated in situ during an active call and the like associated with a panel can be stored in repository which can be implemented using a database data store data warehouse or any other type of data repository or structure. In other examples more fewer or different modules can be used to implement the described techniques for panel presentation and are not limited to those provided.

According to some examples computing device can perform specific operations in which processor executes one or more sequences of one or more instructions stored in system memory . Such instructions can be read into system memory from another computer readable medium such as static storage device or disk drive . In some examples hard wired circuitry can be used in place of or in combination with software instructions for implementation.

In some examples execution of the sequences of instructions can be performed by a single computer system . According to some examples two or more computing systems or devices coupled by communication link e.g. LAN PSTN or wireless network can perform the sequence of instructions in coordination with one another. Computer system or device can transmit and receive messages data and instructions including program code i.e. application code through communication link and communication interface . Received program code can be executed by processor as it is received and or stored in disk drive or other non volatile storage for later execution. In one embodiment computing system or device can be implemented as a hand held device such as a mobile phone or a handheld personal computer or combination mobile phone computer. But in other embodiments computing system or device can be implemented as a personal computer i.e. a desk top computer or any other computing device.
