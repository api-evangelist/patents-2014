The polymodal asymmetric block copolymer and a linear styrene isoprene styrene SIS block copolymer KRATON 1161 D were dry fed into the first zone of the first adhesive extruder. Using a roll feed extruder available from Berstorff either acrylic polymer AP 1 and AP 2 was heated and fed into the third zone of the first adhesive extruder. Antioxidant IRGANOX 1010 ultraviolet light absorber TINUVIN 328 pigmented EVA 4900 CMB were dry fed and REGALITE R1125 CUMAR 130 and NYPLAST 222B were melt fed in to various zones of the first adhesive extruder.

Pressure sensitive adhesives according to the compositions shown in Table 3 were compounded in the first adhesive extruder as described above for first skin adhesive Adh 1 with the following exception. These adhesives of these comparative examples did not contain an acrylic polymer therefore no acrylic polymer was fed in to the second zone of the extruder.

A pressure sensitive adhesive was compounded in a 60 mm co rotating twin screw extruder available from Berstorff the second adhesive extruder in a similar manner as described for the first skin adhesives except that the composition was as follows 12.70 of the polymodal asymmetric star block copolymer PASBC 53.10 by weight AP 1 23.30 tackifying resin ESCOREZ 1310LC 3.80 tackifying resin SUPERESTER W115 6.20 plasticizer SANTICIZER 141 0.26 antioxidant IRGANOX 1010 and 0.25 ultraviolet light absorber TINUVIN 328 .

Foam cores FC1 FC 5 having the compositions shown in Table 4 were compounded according to the following procedure. Black pigmented EVA 4900 CMB was dry fed in to the first zone of a 90 mm co rotating twin screw extruder the core extruder available from Berstorff Hannover Germany . Using a roll feed extruder available from Berstorff both acrylic polymers AP 2 and AP 3 were heated and fed into the second zone of the core extruder. DUALITE U010 185D expandable microspheres expandable microspheres having a shell composition containing acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile and a core of isopentane available from Henkel Corporation Gulph Mills Pa. were fed into the ninth zone of the core extruder.

Three layer co extruded tape samples were prepared by coextruding a first skin adhesive layer a foam core layer as the middle layer and a second skin adhesive layer. Examples 1 11 use exemplary adhesives according to some embodiments of the present disclosure Adh 1 through Adh 11 . Reference examples 1 3 use comparative adhesive CE 1 through CE 3. The tape constructions are described in Table 5.

The second skin adhesive was compounded in the second adhesive extruder as described above and fed through an outer layer of a three layer multi manifold film die obtained from Cloeren Inc. Orange Tex. . A foam core layer was compounded in the core extruder as described above and fed to the center layer of the three layer die. A first skin adhesive was compounded in the first adhesive extruder as described above and fed to the outer layer of the three layer die opposite the second skin adhesive.

Upon exiting the die the co extruded layers were cast onto a silicone release coated casting roll. The roll was cooled with water having a temperature of about 12 C. The cooled extrudate was transferred from the casting roll to a 0.117 mm thick two side silicone coated polyethylene release liner that was transported at the same speed as the casting roll to the end of the web transport line. The first skin adhesive was in contact with the liner after the transfer whereas the second skin adhesive was open to the air. The liner had differential release properties which allow the tape to be unrolled after winding without liner confusion. Release liners are well known in the art and any known release liner may be used. Typically the release liner comprises a film or paper substrate coated with a release material. Commercially available release liners include but are not limited to silicone coated papers and silicone coated films such as polyester films. Suitable release liners are also disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 835 422 6 805 933 6 780 484 and 6 204 350 assigned to 3M Innovative Properties Company.

The foam core and both adhesive skins were crosslinked on web using electron beam curing while supported on the liner. Two sequential irradiation steps acting on opposite faces of the tape were employed. The first skin adhesive was irradiated through the polyethylene liner whereas the second skin adhesive was irradiated in an open face condition. The electron beam units were BROADBAND curtain type electron beam processors PCT Engineered Systems LLC. Davenport Iowa operated according the acceleration voltage and dose conditions provided in Table 5.

The cured adhesive tapes were tested for adhesion to low surface energy automotive paints according to the Breakaway and Continuous Peel Adhesion BACP METHOD described in Ford Motor Co. Specification WSB M3G138 B. Tensile testing was carried out using an MTS Model 1122 tensile tester MTS Systems Corp. Eden Prairie Minn. equipped with TestWorks 4 software programmed to calculate the breakaway load value averaged continuous peel value and total energy.

The test surfaces were steel panels painted with automotive paint systems comprising a base electrocoat pigmented basecoat and a low surface energy carbamate crosslinked unpigmented acrylic based clearcoat. The experimental tapes were adhered to the clearcoat for testing. Test Surface 1 had a measured surface energy Accu Dyne solutions of 33 dynes cm and Test Surface 2 had a measured surface energy of 32 dynes cm.

After applying the test tape to the test surface the samples were conditioned prior to testing. First the samples were conditioned at room temperature for three days. Next the samples were conditioned at 38 C. and 100 relative humidity for six days. Four samples were tested for each tape and the average result is reported in Table 6. The observed failure mode s for each set of samples is also reported in Table 6.

Various modifications and alterations of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention.
