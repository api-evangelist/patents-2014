This application is a continuation of and claims priority to pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 763 565 filed on Feb. 8 2013 entitled Systems and Methods for Multi User Multi Lingual Communications 

The present invention s generally relate to communications and more particularly communications across the world involving multiple users and multiple languages.

Before the advent of machine based language translations hereafter machine translations translation between two languages was only possible via intervention or interpretation by a person educated in both languages. In contrast typical machine translators operate based on statistical stochastic analysis of context and grammar usually without need of human intervention interpretation.

Typical machine translation is often error prone particularly where the text to be translated has a minimal context. Text having minimal context is often found in conversations which employ brief sentence construction. Additionally machine translations often have trouble with abbreviations acronyms diminutives colloquial words phrases proper nouns and common nouns which are also commonly found in conversational text.

Various embodiments described herein provide for systems and methods that relate to multi lingual communications between multiple users possibly where the users are at two or more client systems. Modes of communications facilitated by embodiments may include Internet based chat e.g. Apple iMessage Windows Live Messenger etc. e mail e.g. embedded forum messaging Yahoo mail RFC 5322 etc. text based mobile phone communications e.g. SMS messages or MMS messages postings to online forums e.g. postings to a web based hobby forum and postings to online social media services e.g. Twitter Facebook etc. . For example systems and methods may implement a multi lingual multi user chat system.

For some embodiments the method provided comprises identifying a first language and a second language receiving an initial message in the first language from a first person at a first chat client system who communicates in the first language and querying a data store for a first corresponding message in the second language that is based on the initial message in the first language. If the data store includes the first corresponding message the method may then assist in sending the corresponding message to a second person at a second chat client system who communicates in the second language. Depending on the embodiment the initial message may comprise text an emoticon ASCII based art or other content suitable or customary for a human readable message sent over a network. Additionally the initial message may be part of a larger message being communicated between chat client systems e.g. the initial message is one sentence in a multi sentence message .

If the data store does not include the first corresponding message the method may utilize a transformation engine to attempt to transform at least a portion of the initial message to a transformed message in the first language. Using the transformed message the method may then query the data store for a second corresponding message in the second language that is based on the transformed message.

For certain embodiments the system or method may attempt transforming the initial message using a series of transformation operations before querying the data store is queried for a second corresponding message that is based on the transformed message. Alternatively in some embodiments the system or method may perform the transformation and query iteratively whereby the initial message is transformed using a subset of available transformation operations the data store is queried for a second corresponding message based on the resulting transformed message and if a second corresponding message is not identified another iteration of transformation and query is performed e.g. the resulting transformed message is further transformed using another subset available transformation operations and the data store is queried for a second corresponding message based on the resulting transformed message . In some such embodiments the subset of transformation operations applied in each iteration may be applied to the initial message or may be applied to the latest resulting transformed message.

Eventually the method may assist in translating the initial message or the transformed message to a corresponding message in the second language. In some embodiments the initial message may be translated to the corresponding message when the first corresponding message for the initial message is not in the data store and the transformation engine does not transform at least a portion of the initial message. Additionally in various embodiments the transformed message may be translated to the corresponding message when the first corresponding message for the initial message is not in the data store the transformation engine results in a transformed message that contains the transformation of at least a portion of the initial message and the data store does not include the second corresponding message for the transformed message.

Depending on the embodiment transforming the portion of the initial message may comprise identifying a chatspeak word or phrase e.g. lol gr8t in the initial message and replacing the chatspeak word or phrase with a non chatspeak word or phrase performing a spelling check on the portion of the initial message or identifying an abbreviation in the portion of the initial message and replacing the abbreviation with a word or a phrase corresponding to e.g. represented by the abbreviation e.g. CA with California or brb to be right back .

In addition transforming the portion of the initial message may comprise identifying an acronym in the portion of the initial message and replacing the acronym with a word or a phrase corresponding to e.g. represented by the acronym e.g. USA or identifying a colloquial word or phrase in the portion of the initial message and replacing the colloquial word or phrase with a word or a phrase representing the colloquial word or phrase. Furthermore transforming the portion of the initial message may comprise identifying a profane word or phrase in the portion of the initial message and replacing the profane word or phrase with a non profane word or a phrase e.g. that is representative of the profane word or phrase or removing the profane word or phrase from the initial message.

For some embodiments transforming the portion of the initial message comprises flagging the portion of the initial message to not be translated. For instance wherein a certain portion of the initial message comprises a proper noun a common noun a diminutive an abbreviation or an acronym the method may flag that certain portion such that it is not translated in subsequent operations.

Certain embodiments provide for a system comprising various components that are configured to perform various operations described herein. Likewise certain embodiments provides for a computer program product comprising computer instruction codes configured to cause the computer system to perform various operations described herein.

Other features and aspects of various embodiments will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example the features of such embodiments.

Various embodiments described herein relate to and facilitate multi lingual communications. The systems and methods of some embodiments may enable multi lingual communications through different modes of communications including for example Internet based chat e.g. Apple iMessage Windows Live Messenger etc. e mail e.g. embedded forum messaging Yahoo mail RFC 5322 etc. text based mobile phone communications e.g. SMS messages or MMS messages postings to online forums e.g. postings to a web based hobby forum postings to online social media services e.g. Twitter Facebook etc. and the like. Certain embodiments may also be used to translate transcripts of communications or conversations that took place in the past e.g. deposition transcripts or chat history . Various embodiments may implement communications systems and methods that translate text between two or more languages e.g. spoken while handling accommodating for one or more of the following in the text specialized domain related jargon e.g. chatspeak abbreviations acronyms proper nouns common nouns diminutives colloquial words or phrases and profane words or phrases. For example some systems and methods described herein may be utilized in connection with a chat system such as those used in massive multiplayer online MMO games which tend to have users that chat in different foreign languages. Through certain embodiments the chat dialogue between two or more users can be transparently translated and presented to each user in their respective native language or language of choice. Additionally through the use of a multi tiered multi module transformation process certain embodiments may facilitate faster translation of communication between two or more users e.g. in their respective native languages than otherwise possible by traditional translation systems alone e.g. translation in a matter of microseconds .

According to some embodiments a system or method may perform translation from chatspeak in a first language such as English to chatspeak in a second language such as French. In another example a system or method may perform transformation from chatspeak in the first language e.g. English to formal speak in the first language e.g. English before attempting translation to the second language e.g. French . Some embodiments may achieve such text translations by first querying a data store e.g. translations cache which may contain translations manually entered by a human operator or translations based on previously performed by a translation system e.g. historical translations performed by an embodiment . Embodiments may attempt to transform one or more portions of the text e.g. process one or more of the following within the text chatspeak acronyms abbreviations proper nouns common nouns colloquialisms and profanity to make it more suitable for accurate text translation. For example certain embodiments may transform a given text to account for current or past idiomatic language use across different languages. Embodiments may reattempt querying the data store after transformation of the portions of the text. If this translation lookup reattempt fails embodiments may attempt to translate the text which may have been transformed using a machine translation service e.g. third party cloud based translation service such as Google translate .

Embodiments may attempt to transform a translated piece of formal text to chatspeak in the new language e.g. transform French formal speak to French chatspeak to further refine the translation of the text eventually produced. Accordingly certain embodiments facilitate chat translation between chatspeak in a first language e.g. English to chatspeak in a second language e.g. Russian French Spanish Chinese Hindi etc. .

Some embodiments may help reduce or avoid the need for using machine translations thereby reducing time cost and other overhead associated with machine translations and may facilitate accurate translations of text having minimal context or comprising short sentence structure. Where the machine translation is facilitated by a third party service or over a secure network connection e.g. Secure Socket Layer SSL connection the cost or overhead avoided by certain embodiments may be significant.

As understood herein transformation means manipulating a first text segment in a first language to form a second text segment in the first language. The resulting second text segment may also be referred to herein as the transformed text. Translation will be understood to mean converting a text segment in a first language to a corresponding text segment in a second language.

As also understood herein a transformed translation means translation of a text segment from a first language to a second language that has already been transformed in accordance with embodiments described herein e.g. transformed from chatspeak text in a first language to formal text in the first language . An untransformed translation will be understood to mean a translation of a text segment from a first language to a second language before the text segment has been transformed in accordance with embodiments described herein.

Various embodiments may implement different transformation translation strategies with certain strategies being well suited for particular translation applications. For example for particular chat system applications the transformation strategy implemented may comprise applying the following set of transformation related modules in the order listed chatspeak module acronym module proper noun module common noun module colloquialism module spelling check module abbreviation module and profanity module. Generally the transformation translation strategy employed determines which transformation operations are performed when the transformation operations are performed in the overall translation process e.g. transformation performed before or after machine translation or in what order the transformation operations are performed e.g. precedence or priority of transformation operations . The transformation translation strategy may also determine what translations are pre populated into the data store e.g. translations can be stored in a translation cache to speed up the overall process and when translation caches are utilized in the overall translation process. For certain embodiments the transformation translation strategy employed may be dynamically determined based on the conditions of the environment in which the embodiments are used. For example where a chat system is experiencing a heavier load of users than usual the transformation translation strategy may switch to one that lessens the processing burden of the chat system e.g. relies more on machine translations rather than on the data store .

Each of the clients the chat server and the translation server may be implemented using one or more digital devices which may be similar to the digital devices discussed later with respect to . For instance the client may be any form of computing device capable of receiving user input e.g. configured for user interaction capable of providing a client user interface that facilitates communications with one or more other clients e.g. any of clients through N and capable of communicating with the chat server through the computer network . Such computing devices may include a mobile phone a tablet computing device a laptop a desktop computer personal digital assistant a portable gaming unit a wired gaming unit a thin client a set top box a portable multi media player or any other type of network accessible user device known to those of skill in the art. Further one or more of the chat server and the translation server may comprise of one or more servers which may be operating on or implemented using one or more cloud based services e.g. System as a Service SaaS Platform as a Service PaaS or Infrastructure as a Service IaaS .

The clients may be configured to communicatively connect with the chat server which provides or otherwise facilitates chat sessions between the clients . Each of the clients through N may comprise a chat client system through N respectively that enables a user at each of the clients to access to the chat session through the chat server . Additionally depending on the embodiment each of the chat client systems through N hereafter collectively referred to as chat client systems or chat client system may be implemented as a standalone chat application as a chat feature embedded in non chat application e.g. video game or through a chat service accessible at the client through a web browser. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that for some embodiments the chat client systems may be non heterogeneous with respect to one another and still be capable of establishing a chat session between them. The chat client systems may be capable of receiving chat input e.g. a chat message from their respective users in a language and corresponding character set selected by the user e.g. based on user settings or preferences and transmitting the chat input to the chat server to be relayed to another user e.g. another user at another chat client system . The chat client systems may also be capable of receiving chat output e.g. chat session dialogue from the chat server e.g. from another user at another chat client system and displaying the received chat output in a language and corresponding character set selected by the user e.g. based on user settings or preferences .

Through the use of some embodiments the translation of the chat dialogue may be transparent to the users as dialogue is passed between the chat client systems . Accordingly for some embodiments all chat dialogue presented at a given chat client system may be in a language native to or selected by the user at that given chat client system irrespective of what language is being by users at other chat client systems that are contributing to the same chat dialogue. For example where the user at the chat client system and the user at the chat client system are contributing to the same chat dialogue i.e. involved in the same chat session the user at the chat client system may have chosen to enter and receive chat dialogue in English while the user at the chat client system may have chosen to enter and receive chat dialogue in Russian. Though the users at the client systems and will see the same chat content the chat dialogue will be presented in their respectively chosen languages.

As shown the chat server may comprise a chat host system configured to established and or facilitate chat sessions between the chat client systems and a communication transformation and translation CTT system configured to perform transformation and or translation operations in accordance with the various systems and methods described herein. For some embodiments the chat client systems may establish a chat session with each other through the chat host system and the chat host system may utilize the features of the CTT system in facilitating the transparent translation of chat dialogue between the chat client systems . Those skilled in the art will appreciate that for some embodiments the chat host system and the CTT system may be part of separate servers and that the entity operating the chat host system may be different from the entity operating the CTT system . For instance the chat host system may be a third party chat host system that utilizes the services of the CTT system .

As also shown the translation server may comprise a translation module configured to receive and service requests for machine text translation. In accordance with some embodiments the CTT system may utilize the operations services of the translation module in performing machine translations of texts. The CTT system may use of one or more translation application programming interfaces APIs to obtain access to the services provided by the translation module . Depending on the embodiment the translation module and the server on which it resides may be operated by a third party such as Google which may offer the machine translation services free of charge or for a fee. Though the translation module is shown to be a component operating on a server separate from the CTT system those skilled in the art will appreciate that for some embodiments the translation module may operating on the same server as the CTT system and or may be an integrated component of the CTT system .

The CTT communications module may be configured to facilitate communications between the CTT system and systems and components external to the CTT system such as the chat server and or the translation server . Accordingly through the CTT communications module the CTT system may receive the chat dialogue comprising one or more chat messages to be transformed or translated by the CTT system and may output the translated chat dialogue that results from the CTT system .

The language module may be configured to identify the one or more languages used in connection with chat dialogue received by the CTT system . For some embodiments the language module may identify the language through analysis of the content of the chat dialogue received and or obtaining language preference settings information from the respective chat client systems e.g. chat client systems involved with the chat dialogue received.

The transformation module may be configured to perform transformation operations on chat dialogue comprising one or more chat messages received by the CTT system in accordance with some systems and methods described herein. In accordance with some embodiments the transformation operations performed by the transformation module may include without limitation those relating to chatspeak acronyms abbreviations proper nouns common nouns colloquialisms and profanity. Additional details of the transformation module are discussed in .

The translation data store may be configured to store and subsequently provide previously translated text to the CTT system as the CTT system performs transformed translations and untransformed translations in accordance with the some system and methods described herein. As described herein the translation data store may operate as a cache for translations previously performed by the CTT system and or may store translations manually entered and stored by a human operator e.g. by way of a translation training system . For some embodiments the translation data store may be populated with translations that would speed up the performance of the CTT system with respect to certain chat contexts. For example where the CTT system is utilized in conjunction with a chat system associated with an MMO game the translation data store may be populated e.g. by the operator of the CTT system with transformed and untransformed translations relating specifically to the MMO game. For certain embodiments the multi tiered multi module approach of transforming text used by the transformation module is particularly well suited for handling chat text in MMO games which by nature tends to be complex.

Depending on the embodiment the data store may store either untransformed translations e.g. you vous transformed translations e.g. u vous or both. For some embodiments the translation data store may store translations such that corresponding chat messages may be identified using hash values tags. For instance to store a Spanish translation for an original message in English the Spanish translation may be stored based on a hash value of the English message thereby enabling the Spanish translation to be later located and obtained using the hash value of the English message. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that for some embodiments the translation data store may comprise a separate data store for translations between two specific languages. Accordingly when a chat message is being transformed translated between English and French a corresponding data English French data store may be utilized for operations relating to the translation data store .

The translation API module may be configured to provide the CTT system with access to machine translation services provided external to the CTT system e.g. by the translation module of the translation server . As described herein the translation API module may be utilized by the CTT system when a translation is not located in the translation data store .

The chatspeak module may be configured to identify one or more words or phrases in a chat message that are associated with chat jargon i.e. chatspeak and may be further configured to suggest replacement e.g. corresponding formal i.e. non chatspeak words or phrases for the identified words or phrases. In some embodiments the chatspeak module may flag an identified chatspeak word or phrase to be skipped or otherwise ignored during a subsequent machine translation e.g. by the translation module . Additionally in some embodiments an identified chatspeak word or phrase may be flagged for later review and disposition by a human operator e.g. an administrator of the CTT system . In order to identify a chatspeak word or phrase and or its corresponding formal word or phrase some embodiments may utilize a dataset e.g. stored on a data store comprising chatspeak words or phrases and or mappings between chatspeak words or phrases and their corresponding words and phrases. The dataset may be constructed by way of training or a learning system may be proprietary e.g. manually collected in house by an administrator of the CTT system may be commercially acquired or may be derived from a publicly available Internet knowledgebase. For example the chatspeak module may employ statistical machine translation in its functionality. For some embodiments the statistical machine translation employed may be trained using parallel texts and or using phrase level pairs extracted from transformations that preserve contextual information and or add grammar to an otherwise ungrammatical sentence. The result from the chatspeak module may comprise a chatspeak word or phrase flagged by the chatspeak module to be ignored a suggested replacement or a non chatspeak word or phrase inserted into the message by the chatspeak module e.g. in place of the identified chatspeak word or phrase .

For some embodiments one or more various modules of the transformation module may flag one or more portions of the chat message by inserting a predetermined character before and or after the portion being flagged. For instance where the chatspeak module flags the word LOL in a portion of the chat message the chatspeak module may insert an predetermined character   before and or after the word e.g.  LOL  to indicate that the flagged portion should be ignored by the translation module .

For some embodiments the transformation module may perform two or more transformation operations on the initial message in parallel and in response each of the two or more transformation operations may return a separate response from which the transformation module may then select one transformed message for further processing e.g. to be used in operation . Depending on the embodiment each response may comprise a flagged text portion a suggested replacement or a word or phrase inserted into the initial message. Thereafter the transformed message selected may be according to a priority of selection which can determine which transformed message is selected for further processing and according to what precedent. In some embodiments the priority selection may be according to which transformation operation is most likely to generate a transformed message suitable for a subsequent lookup in the translation data store or for subsequent machine translation. Additionally in some embodiments the priority of selection may be according to which transformation operation generates the most formal transformed message. The priority of selection may depend on the transformation translation strategy selected by the embodiment.

The following provides examples of how the transformation module may process a portion of a chat message in accordance with various embodiments. As shown the transformation module may process a chat message based on tokens or proximal tokens and may cease processing on a particular token once a transformation is performed.

The chat client communications module may be configured to facilitate communications between the chat client system and systems and components external to the chat client system such as the chat server . Accordingly through the chat client module the chat client system may receive from the chat server the chat dialogue to be presented at the chat client system e.g. via the chat client GUI module and may send to the chat server the chat dialogue received from the user at the chat client system e.g. via the chat client GUI module .

The chat client GUI module may be configured to provide a user at the chat client system with graphical input output access to chat sessions with other chat client systems. Accordingly for some embodiments the chat client GUI module may present a user at the client with a client GUI adapted for receiving user interactions through the client . For some embodiments the chat client GUI module may be configured to present the user with chat dialogue e.g. as they are received from the chat server in the language of their choice e.g. according to the user language preferences settings . Additionally the chat client GUI module may be configured to receive chat input from the user in the language of their choice e.g. according to the user language preferences settings . As described herein the language used in presenting and receiving the chat dialogue at the chat client system may be different from the language used in presenting and receiving the chat dialogue at another chat client system. More regarding the chat client GUI module is discussed with respect to .

The method may start at operation the language module of the CTT system may being by identifying a first language being used by a user at a first chat client system e.g. and a second language being used by a user at a second chat client system e.g. . According to some embodiments the language module may identify the first language and the second language by obtaining language preferences settings from the respective chat client system .

At operation the CTT communications module of the CTT system may receive an initial message in the first language. In some embodiments the CTT communications module may receive the initial message from the chat host system which may have received the initial message from a chat client system e.g. .

At operation the CTT control module of the CTT system may query the translation data store for a corresponding message in the second language that corresponds to the initial message. At operation the CTT control module may determine if a corresponding message is found in the translation data store . If one exists at operation the CTT communications module may assist in sending the corresponding message to the second chat client system e.g. the chat client system . In some embodiments the corresponding message may be sent to the chat host system which may relay the corresponding message to the second chat client system e.g. . The method may then end.

If a corresponding message does not exist in the translation data store at operation the transformation module may attempt to transform at least a portion of the initial message to a transformed message in the first language. As described herein the message that results from the transformation module may be transformed or may remain unchanged e.g. when transformation operations of the transformation module are not applied to the initial message . For some embodiments the transformation module may perform two or more transformation operations on the initial message in parallel and in response each of the two or more transformation operations may return a separate response from which the transformation module may then select one transformed message for further processing e.g. to be used in operation . Depending on the embodiment each response may comprise a flagged text portion a suggested replacement or a word or phrase inserted into the initial message. Thereafter the transformed message selected may be according to a priority of selection which can determine which transformed message is selected for further processing and according to what precedent. In some embodiments the priority selection may be according to which transformation operation is most likely to generate a transformed message suitable for a subsequent lookup in the translation data store or for subsequent machine translation. Additionally in some embodiments the priority of selection may be according to which transformation operation generates the most formal transformed message. The priority of selection may depend on the transformation translation strategy selected by the embodiment.

At operation assuming the transformation module transformed the message the CTT control module of the CTT system may query the translation data store for a corresponding message in the second language that corresponds to the transformed message. At operation the CTT control module may determine if a corresponding message is found in the translation data store . If one exists at operation the CTT communications module may assist in sending the corresponding message to the second chat client system e.g. the chat client system . In some embodiments the corresponding message may be sent to the chat host system which may then relay the corresponding message to the second chat client system e.g. . The method may then end.

For some embodiments if a corresponding message still does not exist in the translation data store at operation the CTT control module may determine if there are any additional transformation operations of the transformation module to perform on the chat message that have not already been performed.

If an additional transformation operation exists the method returns to operation and performs additional transformation operation s . Depending on the embodiment the additional transformation operation s may involve applying a transform operation different from those already performed on the initial message by the transformation module may involve applying the same transformation operations performed but to different portions of the English chat message or may involve some combination thereof. For example if during the first execution of operation the transformation module applies a chatspeak related operation to the initial message to create a first transformed message during a second execution of operation the transformation module may apply an abbreviation related operation to the second transformed message. Following a subsequent execution of operation the method may continue to operations and where the CTT control module may re query the translation data store for a corresponding message in the second language that corresponds to the latest resulting transformed message and the CTT control module may determine if a corresponding message is found in the translation data store . By performing the transformation and query operations in this iterative manner certain embodiments may be able to find a corresponding message before having to perform every transformation operation available. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that for certain embodiments the transformation and query operations may be performed in series with the query operation e.g. operation only being performed after every available transformation operation provided by the transformation module has been performed on the chat message.

If a corresponding message does not exist in the translation data store and an additional transformation operation of the transformation module does not exist at operation through the translation API module the translation module may assist in the translating the initial message or the transformed message to a corresponding message in the second language. Subsequently at operation the CTT communications module may assist in sending the corresponding message to the second chat client system e.g. the chat client system . According to some embodiments the corresponding message may be sent to the chat host system which may then relay the corresponding message to the second chat client system e.g. . The method may then end.

For certain embodiments the transformation module may be utilized to transform the corresponding message in the second language before the corresponding message is sent to the chat host system . As described herein the corresponding message may be submitted for further transformation processing to further refine the translation for the user at the second chat client system e.g. . For example if the initial message contains chatspeak in the first language e.g. English additional transformation processing can add to the extent possible chatspeak in the second language.

In accordance with some embodiments the message that ultimately results from the transformation module e.g. the eighth intermediate message resulting from operation may subsequently be used to query the translation data store for a corresponding message which can serve as a translation for the resulting message. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that in some instances the message resulting from the transformation module e.g. message subsequently used in the query to the translation data store may be the same as the initial message received e.g. at operation when no transformation has been applied to the initial message e.g. the initial message passes through operations without any transformations being applied .

Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that various embodiments may perform more or less operations than the ones shown may perform operations different from those shown and may perform operations in a different order. Generally the types of transformation operations performed and the order in which they are performed may be depend on transformation strategy employed by the embodiments. As noted herein various embodiments may implement different transformation translation strategies in achieving their respective translations with certain strategies being well suited for particular translation applications or translation contexts. The transformation translation strategy employed may determine which transformation operations are performed when the transformation operations are performed or in what order the transformation operations are performed. The transformation translation strategy may also determine what translations are populated into a translation data stores and when a translation data store is utilized in the overall transformation translation process.

For some embodiments the intermediate messages resulting from operations in the method may have an impact and or cascading effect on messages that result from subsequent operations in the method . Additionally for some embodiments when a chat message is processed by the method each operations of flow chart may be performed on the chat message before the method concludes. Alternatively for some embodiments the method of flowchart may terminate early upon the performance of only a subset of the operations shown e.g. after at least one operation results in a transformation of the chat message . According to some embodiments the performance of each operation in flowchart may be followed by a query to the translation data store for a corresponding message in the desired language based on the latest resulting transformed message in the event a corresponding message is identified the method of flowchart may terminate early.

For various embodiments the method may perform operations in parallel. For example the CTT control module may submit the initial message to two or more operations in parallel and receive from each of those two or more operations a separate response. Each response may comprise a flagged text portion a suggested replacement or a word or phrase inserted into the initial message. Thereafter the CTT control module may select one of the received responses for subsequent processing e.g. query a translation data store or translating by the translation module possibly according to a priority of selection e.g. which can determine which transformed message is selected for further processing and according to what precedent .

For instance during the method the CTT control module may submit an initial message to operation for identifying chatspeak processing operation for common noun processing and operation for abbreviation processing. In response operation may return the initial message transformed for chatspeak operation may return the initial message unchanged and operation may return the initial message transformed for abbreviations. Subsequently based on a priority of selection the CTT control module may select the transformed message returned from operation for further processing.

For certain embodiments a time limit may be enforced on performing various operations in the method . The time limit may cause a transformation operation of method to stop performing if a response result is not received before the time limit has expired. In doing so various embodiments may ensure that certain transformation operations do not unnecessarily hinder the overall transformation translation process.

Though the operations of the above method may be depicted and described in a certain order those skilled in the art will appreciate that the order in which the operations are performed may vary between embodiments. Additionally those skilled in the art will appreciate that the components described above with respect to the method of the flowchart are merely examples of components that may be used with the method and for some embodiments other components may also be utilized in some embodiments.

As shown at operation the first chat client system may submit the English message for transmission to the second chat client system e.g. via the chat host system . The English message may be routed to the CTT control module of the CTT system for translation processing.

At operation the CTT control module may query the translation data store for a chat message that corresponds to the English chat message LOL and that is pre translated to French. In response at operation the translation data store may return to the CTT control module a corresponding French message MDR that corresponds to the English chat message LOL . Subsequently at operation the CTT control module may assist in the transmission of the corresponding French chat message MDR to the second chat client system e.g. CTT system submits the corresponding French chat message to the chat host system for transmission .

As shown at operation the first chat client system may submit the English chat message for transmission to the second chat client system e.g. via the chat host system with a user that speaks French. The English chat message may be routed to the CTT control module of the CTT system for translation processing.

At operation the CTT control module may query the translation data store for a French equivalent chat message that corresponds to the English chat message LOL . In response at operation the translation data store may return a query failure to the CTT control module to indicate that the translation data store does not have a corresponding French chat message for the English chat message LOL . If such is the case at operation the CTT control module may submit the English chat message to the transformation module for transformation processing in accordance with certain embodiments. As described herein the transformation module may comprise multiple transformation related modules configured to transform a chat message to a message more suitable for further translation processing.

At operation the chatspeak module of the transformation module may transform the English chat message LOL to the transformed English chat message laugh out loud and may return the transformed English chat message to the CTT control module for further processing. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that for some embodiments the English chat message may be processed by additional modules of the transformation module before the transformed English chat message is returned to the CTT control module .

At operation the CTT control module may query the translation data store for a French equivalent chat message that corresponds to the transformed English chat message laugh out loud . In response at operation the translation data store may return a query failure to the CTT control module to indicate that the translation data store does not have a corresponding French chat message for the transformed English chat message laugh out loud . If such is the case at operation the CTT control module may submit the transformed English chat message to the translation module for machine translation processing in accordance with certain embodiments.

At operation the translation module may return a machine translated French chat message mort de rire that corresponds to the transformed English chat message. The resulting machine translated French chat message mort de rire is an example of a transformed translation of an English chatspeak chat message LOL .

At operation the CTT control module may submit the machine translated French chat message mort de rire to the transformation module for further transformation processing of the machine translated French chat message in accordance with certain embodiments. As noted herein the machine translated text may be submitted for further transformation processing to further refine the French translation. For example if the original English chat message contained English chatspeak the additional transformation processing can add to the extent possible French chatspeak. Accordingly at operation the chatspeak module of the transformation module may transform the machine translated French chat message mort de rire to the transformed French chat message MDR and may return the transformed French chat message to the CTT control module for further processing.

Eventually at operation the CTT control module may assist in the transmission of the corresponding French chat message MDR to the second chat client system e.g. CTT system submits the corresponding French chat message to the chat host system for transmission . Additionally at operation the CTT control module may store a translation mapping in the translation data store of the transformed translation between the original English chat message LOL and the translated French chat message MDR . Once the mapping is stored in the translation data store it may be used to store translation entries to speed up future translations e.g. as illustrated in . As noted herein the translation data store may store mappings of transformed translations and untransformed translations.

For some embodiments the CTT control module may also store equivalent transformed and untransformed translation mappings determined during the operation of the method . For certain embodiments the translation mappings may be between chat message that were not original located in the translation data store e.g. the chat message shown for operation and the chat message shown for operation and a corresponding message determined during operations subsequent to the translation data store lookups e.g. a mapping between a query to the translation data store that returns no result and a corresponding chat message determined after the query by way of the transformation module and or the translation module .

For instance as shown in the CTT control module queries the translation data store for original English chat message LOL at operation and the transformed English chat message laugh out loud at operation both of which resulted in the CTT control module receiving no results from the translation data store at operations and respectively . However at operation the CTT control module eventually submits the transformed English message laugh out loud to the machine translation module for machine translation and receives in response the machine translated French chat message mort de rire at operation . Accordingly at operation the CTT control module may store a translation mapping in the translation data store of the transformed translation between the original English chat message LOL and the machine translated French chat message mort de rire . Likewise at operation the CTT control module may store a translation mapping in the translation data store of the transformed translation between the transformed English chat message laugh out loud and the machine translated French chat message mort de rire . In doing so next time method queries the translation data store for the original English chat message LOL or the transformed English chat message laugh out loud the translation data store will provide the corresponding transformed translations.

As shown at operation the first chat client system may submit the English chat message for transmission to the second chat client system e.g. via the chat host system . The English chat message may be routed to the CTT control module of the CTT system for translation processing.

At operation the CTT control module may query the translation data store for a French equivalent chat message that corresponds to the English chat message Who u laughin at . In response at operation the translation data store may return a query failure to the CTT control module to indicate that the translation data store does not have a corresponding French chat message for the English chat message Who u laughin at . If such is the case at operation the CTT control module may submit the English chat message to the transformation module for transformation processing in accordance with certain embodiments. As described herein the transformation module may comprise multiple transformation related modules configured to transform a chat message to a message more suitable for further translation processing.

At operation the chatspeak module of the transformation module may transform the English chat message Who u laughin at to the transformed English chat message Who you laughin at and pass on the transformed English chat message to additional modules of the transformation module for further processing such as the spelling check module .

As discussed herein various modules of transformation module including the chatspeak module may be configured to identify one or more words or phrases in a chat message and suggest replacement words or phrases for the identified words or phrases. Accordingly those skilled in the art would appreciate that for some embodiments the transformation performed suggested by a module of transformation module may involve a word to phrase or a phrase to phrase transformation of the chat message. For example at operation the chatspeak module may alternatively transform the English chat message Who u laughin at to the transformed English chat message Who are you laughing at possibly by replacing suggesting the replacement of the phrase who u with who are you during the transformation followed by the replacement suggestion of the replacing the word laughin with laughing . In doing so various modules of the transformation module such as the chatspeak module may provide grammatical improvements to their respective transformations while possibly obviating the need for a separate module in the transformation module to implement grammar improvements.

For some embodiments before the transformed English chat message is passed on to additional modules of the transformation module the chatspeak module may pass on the transformed English chat message to the CTT control module at operation . In turn the CTT control module may query the translation data store at operation for a French equivalent chat message that corresponds to the transformed English chat message Who you laughin at . In response at operation the translation data store may return a query failure to the CTT control module to indicate that the translation data store does not have a corresponding French chat message for the transformed English chat message Who you laughin at .

At operation the spelling check module may perform a spell check process on the transformed English chat message Who you laughin at at operation . During the spell check process the spelling check module may correct the transformed English chat message to a corrected English chat message Who you laughing at and may return the corrected English chat message to the CTT control module . Those skilled in the art will appreciate that for some embodiments the corrected English chat message may processed by additional modules of the transformation module before the transformed English chat message is returned to the CTT control module .

At operation the CTT control module may query the translation data store for a French equivalent chat message that corresponds to the corrected English chat message Who you laughing at . In response at operation the translation data store may return a query failure to the CTT control module to indicate that the translation data store does not have a corresponding French chat message for the corrected English chat message Who you laughing at . If such is the case at operation the CTT control module may submit the corrected English chat message to the translation module for machine translation processing in accordance with certain embodiments.

At operation the translation module may return a machine translated French chat message Qui te fait rire that corresponds to the corrected English chat message. At operation the CTT control module may submit the machine translated French chat message Qui te fait rire to the transformation module for further transformation processing of the machine translated French chat message in accordance with certain embodiments.

As noted herein the machine translated text may be submitted for further transformation processing to further refine the translation of the text. For example if the original English chat message contained English chatspeak the additional transformation processing can add to the extent possible French chatspeak.

According to some embodiments the transformation operations performed by the transformation module may comprise performing certain transformation operations in parallel and perform certain transformation operations in serial. The order in which transformation operations are performed in parallel and in serial may vary between various embodiments. As described herein where the transformation operations are performed in parallel some embodiments may employ a priority of selection to determine which transformed message is selected for further processing and according to what precedent.

As shown at operation the first chat client system may submit the English chat message for transmission to the second chat client system e.g. via the chat host system . The English chat message may be routed to the CTT control module of the CTT system for translation processing.

At operation the CTT control module may query the translation data store for a French equivalent chat message that corresponds to the English chat message Who u laughin at . In response at operation the translation data store may return a query failure to the CTT control module to indicate that the translation data store does not have a corresponding French chat message for the English chat message Who u laughin at .

If such is the case the CTT control module may submit the English chat message to the transformation module for transformation processing in accordance with certain embodiments. As described herein the transformation module may comprise multiple transformation related modules configured to transform a chat message to a message more suitable for further translation processing. As shown in during operations the CTT control module may submit the English chat message Who u laughin at in parallel to two or more transformation related modules of the transformation module . Additionally during operations the CTT control module may be receiving results from the transformation related modules in parallel and submitting queries to the translation data store based on the transformation results in parallel.

Accordingly at operation the CTT control module may submit the English chat message Who u laughin at to the chatspeak module for transformation processing. In parallel at operation the CTT control module may submit the English chat message Who u laughin at to the spelling check module for transformation processing. Subsequently the CTT control module may receive a first transformed English chat message Who you laughin at from the chatspeak module at operation while at operation the CTT control module may receive a second transformed English chat message Who u laughing at from the spelling check module . Depending on their respective transformation processing times the chatspeak module the spelling check module and the other transformation related modules may respond to the CTT control module in serial or in parallel with respect to one another.

Subsequently at operation the CTT control module may query the translation data store for a French equivalent chat message that corresponds to the first transformed English chat message Who you laughin at . At operation the CTT control module may query the translation data store for a French equivalent chat message that corresponds to the second transformed English chat message Who u laughing at . For some embodiments during operations and the CTT control module may query the translation data store in serial or in parallel. In some embodiments the timings of the queries may depend on when the transformation related modules of the transformation module return their respective responses. As shown in the translation data store may return a query failure e.g. for the queries at operations and

Eventually the CTT control module may select one transformed message from the two or more messages that result from the parallel operations for further processing. Where only one of the transformation related modules results in a transformed message the CTT control module may select that particular transformed message for further processing. As noted herein the CTT control module may select a transformed message based on a priority of selection which may be determined according to the transformation translation strategy selected by the embodiments. For some embodiments the priority of selection may be based on whether the transformed message has the most formal content the transformed message has the most transformations or the transformed message results from a transformation related module known for having a high likelihood of producing a transformed message suitable for machine translation.

Once a transformed message has been selected at operation the CTT control module may submit the transformed English chat message to the translation module for machine translation processing in accordance with certain embodiments. For example as shown in the CTT control module may select the first transformed English chat message produced by the chatspeak module Who you laughin at for submission to the translation module .

At operation the translation module may return a machine translated French chat message Qui te fait rire that corresponds to the first transformed English chat message and despite comprising the misspelled word laughin . At operation the CTT control module may submit the machine translated French chat message Qui te fait rire to the transformation module for further transformation processing of the machine translated French chat message in accordance with certain embodiments.

As noted herein the machine translated text may be submitted for further transformation processing to further refine the translation of the text. For example if the original English chat message contained English chatspeak the additional transformation processing can add to the extent possible French chatspeak. At operation the transformation module may return the machine translated French chat message Qui te fait rire unchanged to the CTT control module for further processing e.g. when the modules of the transformation module do not apply any changes to the machine translated French chat message .
