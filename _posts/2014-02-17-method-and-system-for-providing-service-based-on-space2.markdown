This application claims the benefit of the Korean Patent Application No. 10 2014 0014662 filed on Feb. 10 2014 which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

The exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to a method and system for providing service based on space.

Internet of Things IoT consists of an evolved form of the conventional Ubiquitous Sensor Network USN or Machine to Machine M2M . Herein the main purpose of the conventional M2M relates to performing communication between an end device and a human being. However the IoT extends its range of purpose and allows communication to be established between objects which are commonly seen in our surroundings such as telephone receivers books thermometers and so on. More specifically IoT may refer to connection network between objects and spaces which establishes an intelligent relation enabling mutually cooperative sensing networking information processing and so on to be performed without any explicit human intervention with respect to three dispersed environmental elements i.e. man or human being object and service.

In addition to the above described IoT extensive research and development is being carried out on a wide range of concepts and technologies such as Web of Things WoT Web of Objects WoO and so on. With the evolution and spreading of such concepts and technologies the usage of devices e.g. gadgets sensor devices actuators and so on which allow users to easily establish connection to the Internet is expected to be increased.

With the advent of such IoT environment the development of services that can control diverse IoT devices within a specific spatial environment is being required. For example when assuming that a conference room of a smart building is being used a user should be capable of controlling IoT devices in accordance with the purpose for using the corresponding conference room or the IoT devices should be capable of automatically changing the temperature ventilation settings intensity of illumination or brightness sound and so on in accordance with the current situation.

However in the related art method the spatial environments diversely exist e.g. home office conference room and so on . And considering the fact that multiple IoT devices exist in each of the spatial environments the related art method is disadvantageous in that it is very troublesome and inconvenient for the users to access the individual services provided to each of the multiple IoT devices.

Additionally the device of the user and each of the IoT devices only maintain a closed or exclusive or vertical relation between one another information on the space between the devices is insufficient. For example only a relation between a first IoT device and the device of the user and a relation between a second IoT device and the device of the user are used in the related art method and whether or not the first IoT device and the second IoT device are included in the same space e.g. one office cannot be known. However for example in one space correlated and or integrated control is required to be performed on an air conditioner a boiler or heating system and a humidifier.

Furthermore instead of using one space multiple spaces are required to be linked or connected to one another. For example devices installed at a building entrance and in conference rooms may be required to share information with one another and devices installed in a living room and in bedrooms may be required to share information with one another. However as described above the related art method is disadvantageous in that since the user only provides a service of an individual IoT device or individual control on IoT devices related to a single service due to insufficient information on the spaces interconnection or link between the spaces cannot be provided.

Accordingly the present invention is directed to a method and system for providing a service based on space that substantially obviates one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.

An object of the present invention is to provide a method and system for providing a service based on space that can provide a service using a smart access point which can interconnect and or integrate IoT devices within a specific space and that can connect each of multiple smart access points existing in multiple spaces to one another thereby being capable of providing linked or interconnected service to one another within multiple spaces.

Additional advantages objects and features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned from practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.

According to an aspect of the present invention at least one of the multiple registered smart access points may be identified by an E mail address being assigned to the at least one registered smart access point and the user or service related to the user may acquire control of space on the corresponding space in accordance with a request made by using the assigned E mail address.

According to another aspect of the present invention a control of device on at least one IoT device may be provided to an external service wherein the external service is provided to the user through an open Application Programming Interface API and the at least one IoT device corresponding to the provided control of device may be controlled based upon an input of the user respective to the external service.

According to an aspect of the present invention the method may further include the steps of providing first service control information to a first smart access point in accordance with a request of the first smart access point the first smart access point being accessed by a terminal of a user among multiple access points and providing second service control information to a second smart access point in accordance with a request of the second smart access point when the terminal of the user accesses the second smart access point among the multiple access points and when the second smart access point recognizes a movement of the user.

According to another aspect of the present invention a service being provided through the first service control information and a service being provided through the second service control information may have service continuity between one another.

In a system providing a service being realized through a smart access point service platform the system providing a service includes a smart access point controller configured to register and authenticate multiple smart access points corresponding to multiple spaces an exposure controller configured to provide internal and external interconnection interface functions respective to a service provided by the smart access point service platform and each of the multiple smart access points a spatial smart access point controller configured to manage at least one location information of physical location information and logical location information of the multiple smart access points and a resource controller configured to manage IoT devices connected to each of the multiple smart access point and available resource of an external service.

It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description of the present invention are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.

Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.

The IoT Device Control Master may provide the user with a controlling service configured to control IoT devices existing in the corresponding space through the device of the user . In order to do so as shown in the IoT Device Control Master may communicate with diverse IoT devices within the specific spatial environment .

As described above in an object computing environment an access point is being required in order to establish connection between an object device existing in a specific space and an object computing environment. And the access point should be capable of supporting the access or connection of diverse IoT devices. In order to do so in an environment such as Internet of Things IoT Web of Things WoT Web of Objects WoO and so on in addition to a network connection device or network access point an object computing environment for controlling and virtualizing an object device IoT device may be required. For example the object computing environment may refer to an environment which is configured to virtualize each IoT device and to operate each of the virtualized IoT devices.

In the exemplary embodiments of the present invention a smart access point such as the IoT device control master of may directly operate or control the accessed IoT devices. In this case instead of being simply used as a network connection path the function and significance of the access point should be changed to a smart access point which is being used as a service execution environment for the connected or accessed IoT devices. A Virtual Object VO corresponding to diverse objects e.g. IoT devices of may be executed within the smart access point and the user e.g. user of may be capable of controlling the IoT devices through a connection with a wanted virtual object.

At this point the smart access point may correspond to a device establishing one hop or single hop connection within an IoT device and providing a service which is configured to operate virtualized IoT devices in the form of a virtual object. Such a smart access point may be equipped with an interface that is configured to be operated in connection with diverse IoT devices by using diverse communication protocols such as Wireless Local Area Network WLAN Zigbee Bluetooth Z wave Ethernet RS232 serial and so on. illustrates an exemplary hardware configuration of a smart access point according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. shows configuration elements of Micro Processor Unit MPU Joint Test Action Group JTAG Secure Digital Multi Media Card SD MMC Electrically Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory EEPROM RS232 Serial Zigbee Bluetooth Z wave USB PHY USB Type A DDR2 3 Mini Peripheral Component Interconnect PCI Express PHY RJ45 Clocking Power Circuit Power On Reset POR Configuration Cfg. Power Over Ethernet POE and so on. Herein since each configuration element is already well known detailed description of the same will be omitted for simplicity. Additionally merely illustrates an exemplary hardware configuration of the smart access point. And therefore the smart access point be further equipped with additional elements that are not shown in or the smart access point may be configured to have some of the elements omitted from the smart access point or to have two or more elements combined and positioned in the smart access point.

IoT devices accessing a single smart access point may be considered to belong to a single space. If multiple spaces exist in order to establish connection between the multiple spaces the smart access point AP of each space may communicate with one another by being interconnected by a Smart AP service platform which corresponds to a control dedicated service platform.

 1 User A being identified by an e mail address of aaa abc.com and User B being identified by an e mail address of bbb def.re.kr wish to have a meeting in a conference room of Building C on Wednesday at 3 00 p.m.

 2 User A may invite User B by using the identifier bbb def.re.kr of User B and may reserve Conference Room A313 of Building C through a Calendar service by using the smart phone of User A. Herein Conference Room A313 of building C may be identified by an e mail address of CA313 thingsgate.com which corresponds to space matching identifier of the respective conference room. And by inviting the e mail address CA313 thingsgate.com through the Calendar service Conference Room A313 may be reserved by User A. At this point management of IoT devices that are included in the space of Conference Room A313 and management of the related services may be carried out by a smart access point belonging to Conference Room A313. In order to allow users to easily use Conference Room A313 in a cooperative environment such smart access point may be assigned with the above described e mail address of CA313 thingsgate.com .

 3 As User B arrives in front of Building C as soon as a Wi Fi signal of Building C is received by the smart phone of User B a welcoming message of an access information service or connection information service of Building C may be exposed to or displayed on the smart phone of User B. If User B responds to such welcoming message reservation information that has been prearranged through the Calendar service may be notified to the smart phone of User B.

 4 User B may then move on to Conference Room A313 by being provided with a Wi Fi signal based location guidance through the smart phone of User B. And while User B is moving to Conference Room A313 automatic authentication of all doors located along the path may be realized thereby allowing User B to pass through all doors in order to reach Conference Room A313 without any separate ID tag. In 3 and 4 smart access points of each individual space may be connected to one another through a smart access point service platform. Accordingly once User B is authenticated at the entrance of Building C the corresponding authentication information is shared by all smart access points through the smart access point service platform thereby reducing the complexity in sequential authentication procedures of the smart access points which are connected to one another along the movement path of User B. Furthermore in providing services to User B service information between the smart access points being sequentially accessed by the smart phone of User B may be shared through the smart access point service platform.

 5 When User B enters Conference Room B lights and lamps installed in the conference room may be automatically turned on and operation of a ventilation system may be initiated. Thereafter when User A enters Conference Room A313 a projector may be turned on blinders of the conference room windows may be shut and the lights may be turned off. In addition to such automatic services of the IoT devices the users may be capable of controlling the specific space by using IoT applications existing within the smart access points of the corresponding space.

As described in the exemplary scenario presented above the need for sequential provision of spatial intelligence service between smart access points is increasing and a service that can recognize and track situational changes in persons objects and devices within a corresponding space should be provided. For example the service should be capable of supporting interconnected functions with diverse multi modal sensors. And such service should be provided with a function that can manage spatial sensors and IoT devices through an object which is configured to have a virtualized format in a distributed environment and a function that can reconfigure a dynamic virtual environment in accordance with situational changes.

1. Spatial situation information is acquired by each individual smart access point and the acquired spatial situation information may be processed based upon a virtualized object.

2. A smart access point may deliver information on user access and pre defines events to a smart access point service platform which corresponds to an upper level service platform.

3. The smart access point service platform searches for a customized spatial intelligence service in accordance with the characteristic of an event and the smart access point service platform may provide control information for providing such customized spatial intelligence service to the corresponding smart access point.

4. Each individual smart access point may provide the users with service continuity and device interconnection services by controlling the virtualized objects.

Initial access recognition of a user device or user equipment may be verified by using diverse methods. For example in case of using a Bluetooth beacon it will be advantageous in that service invoke can be available based on low power. In case of using Wi Fi devices that do not support Bluetooth 4.0 may be supported and it will be advantageous in that the Wi Fi can be applicable to mode terminals or equipments .

In case of a Bluetooth smart device or a smart ready device Bluetooth based service invoke may be carried out by using a method of waking up a service within a Handset of a user through a beacon after installing a beacon module at locations where service invoke mostly occurs.

The initial access recognition of a user equipment or user terminal which is carried out by the smart access point may be carried out by determining whether or not a terminal which initially accesses the Wi Fi corresponds to a service target.

When a user behavior of User enters entrance occurs the smart access point AP may perform a step of Attempt access to terminal . For example in in case the user enters the Entrance of the building and when a Wi Fi signal of the user s terminal is detected the smart access point AP may attempt to access or establish connection with the user s terminal.

At this point in case a connection is established between the user s terminal and the smart access point AP the smart access point AP may perform a step of Attempt user authentication . For example the smart access point AP may transmit a message for verifying whether or not authentication is authorized to the user s terminal. Herein in case a user behavior of Authorize authentication occurs the smart access point AP may request the smart access point AP platform for a user authentication.

After receiving the request for user authentication the smart AP service platform may perform a step of Authenticate user and in case the user is authenticated the smart AP service platform may provide the user authentication information to the smart access point AP having requested for the user authentication. In this case the smart access point AP may perform a step of Acquire user authentication information .

Additionally the smart access point AP may perform a step of Request a search for user related information . For example the smart access point AP may inquire the smart AP service platform on whether or not information related to the authenticated user exists. In this case the smart AP service platform may perform a step of Search for Smart AP information within space and a step of Verify and control service . For example the smart AP service platform may verify that the user has reserved Conference Room through the smart access point AP of Conference Room . And then after verifying a service for guiding the user to Conference Room the smart AP service platform may control the smart access point AP .

The smart access point AP may perform a step of Execute service . For example the smart access point AP may provide a service list which can be provided based upon information being provided from the smart AP service platform to the user s terminal. At this point in case a user behavior of Select Use Service occurs the smart access point AP may provide the selected service to the user. For example when a service for providing guidance to Conference Room is selected by the user s terminal the smart access point AP may provide the user s terminal with information guiding the user to Conference Room .

When a user behavior Move to another user space occurs and when the user enter a space of the smart access point AP the smart access point AP may perform a step of Detect user s mobile access and a step of Request for user authentication information . For example after verifying that the corresponding user has performed mobile access through the smart access point AP the smart access point AP may request the smart access point AP for the user s authentication information.

At this point the smart access point AP may perform a step of Deliver user authentication information . For example the smart access point AP may transmit user authentication information which is received from the smart AP service platform to the smart access point AP .

Moreover the smart access point AP may notify the smart AP service platform that the smart access point AP has delivered the user authentication information to the smart access point AP and the smart AP service platform may perform a step of Update device control information and a step of Verify and control service . For example the smart AP service platform may verify that the user has entered the space respective to the smart access point AP . Then the smart AP service platform may verify an available service which can be provided through the smart access point AP and then provide the smart access point AP within information for controlling the smart access point AP .

In this case the smart access point AP may perform a step of Execute service . For example the smart access point AP may provide the user s terminal with information guiding the user to Conference Room .

In case the user continues to move toward Conference Room and in case a user behavior of Arrive at Conference Room wherein the user enters the space of the smart access point AP the smart access point AP may perform a step of Detect user s mobile access and a step of Request for user authentication information and the smart access point AP may perform a step of Deliver user authentication information . Similarly the smart AP service platform may perform a step of Update device control information and a step of Verify and control service . At this point the smart access point AP may perform a step of Execute Service . For example the smart access point AP may control the IoT devices included in Conference Room so that the lights can be automatically turned on and so that the operation of the ventilation device or cooling heating device or air conditioning device can be initiated.

In step the smart access point may receive event information and may perform routing of a message to a related virtual object. The smart access point may perform a function of routing an input output message related to sensors and or IoT devices. At this point as described above the sensors and or IoT devices may be managed by the smart access point as virtualized objects.

In step the smart access point may process and interpret an event through a virtual object. For example in the information being provided by each virtual object data type e.g. unit of the individual information may be explicitly pre determined. At this point the smart access point may collect information related to the virtual object using the same unit based upon such data type. Then after adding weight to the collected information the smart access point may use the processed value. Thereafter when a physical problem occurs in a specific sensor and or IoT device or when a problem occurs in data reception the processed information may be replaced with information of another sensor and or IoT device belonging to a neighboring smart access point. For example when the smart access point receives different temperature information from two or more sensors and or IoT devices the smart access point may verify the average value of each temperature information value having weight added thereto as the current temperature. In another example when the smart access point detects any physical problem in the temperature sensor or any problem in the communication with the temperature sensor the smart access point may receive and user temperature values which are received from another temperature sensor belonging to another neighboring smart access point through the other neighboring smart access point.

In step the smart access point may decide whether or not space situation control information is acquired. At this point in case the space situation control information is acquired the smart access point may perform step and in case the space situation control information is not acquired the smart access point may perform step .

In step the smart access point may deliver the space situation control information to the smart AP service platform.

In step the smart AP service platform may verify the information of the smart access point and may update the related information.

In step the smart access point may request the smart AP service platform for a reconfiguration of the related service. After step the smart access point may perform step .

The smart AP controller may register and authenticate a smart access point AP . For example the smart AP controller may provide a function of authenticating a device which is equipped with a wireless router or gateway instance hosting function and a function of collecting access location information. Herein the wireless router or gateway instance hosting function may include a function allowing the smart access point to route messages between virtual objects corresponding to IoT devices or to manage an instance corresponding to a virtual object.

Such smart access point controller may include an identification authentication manager ID Auth Manager which is configured to assign an identifier ID to a smart access point based upon unique information e.g. MAC of the corresponding smart access point when a connection or access of the smart access point is established a Connectivity Manager which is configured to manage a connection of a smart access point a Location Manager which is configured to manage location information of a smart access point based upon an IP address and a user e.g. manager input information. At this point the connectivity manager may include a function for managing a continuous connected state even when using a dynamic IP address.

Examples of a list of information being collected in relation to data input and output at a point when a smart access point is being registered and information related to the device status are shown below in Table 2.

Herein the instance manager may correspond to a module which is configured to execute a process for a service logic that can be executed with respect to resources e.g. IoT devices related to the smart access point and to deliver messages generated by the process to another process or to another resource and to manage such messages.

The radio interference information may be acquired by having the smart AP controller periodically collect the information with respect to surrounding radio signals and Service Set Identifiers SSIDs .

The IoT application installation information may include information such as application profile application title tag data unit and so on and the IoT device connection information may be determined by using a minimum access verification cycle period based upon the application profile of the IoT application installation information.

In case the smart access point has a 1 space control function and an 2 IoT device control function of a specific spatial area in the form of a Master the location manager may provide a function for managing control of resource i.e. a specific service or user based upon a time table respective to the corresponding space. For example in case a smart access point installed in Conference Room exists when carrying out its registration to the smart AP service platform the corresponding smart access point may also register information on the control of resource to the smart AP service platform . And the location manager may issue or assign an E mail address respective to the control of space respective to the space corresponding to Conference Room . Thereafter the user may gain the control of space of Conference Room by using the issued or assigned E mail address.

The exposure controller may use an IoT application of an individual smart access point an IoT interconnection application of a third party 3Party an IoT device connected to the smart access point and spatial situation control information. For example the exposure controller may provide an internal external interconnection interface function respective to service functions which are provided by the smart AP service platform and the individual smart access point.

The exposure controller may include an Open API Manager an Authentication Manager OAuth Manager and an Open ID Manager .

The open API manager may provide functions of performing authentication logging data interconnection and so on on diverse interface information that are provided in open API formats. At this point a virtual object based service which is connected to the smart access point may generate an open API which is disclosed through the smart AP service platform .

The Authentication Manager OAuth Manager may provide an OAuth based user and service authentication function. The OAuth corresponds to a standard authentication method which is developed as an open API and the OAuth may be used when user authentication is to be performed in each application. Since the OAuth is already well known detailed description of the same will be omitted for simplicity.

The open ID manager may provide an open ID based user and service authentication function. Since the open ID is also well known detailed description of the same will also be omitted for simplicity.

In case an E mail address is assigned to a smart access point in order to provide a service based on space to the corresponding smart access point an OAuth or an open ID may be used to authenticate the corresponding smart access point. Additionally in case of using a device control service of the smart access point in addition to a method of allowing access by authenticating the smart access point using open API the smart access point may be authenticated to the device control service within the smart AP service platform by using OAuth or open ID or the smart access point may be directly authenticated.

The resource controller may manage resources of the smart access point and resources of an IoT device connected to the smart access point and may directly execute a related service. The resource controller may provide a function of managing available resources respective to sensing and controlling devices which are connected to individual smart access points and interconnected external services e.g. an external service for controlling IoT device through an open API . Additionally the resource controller may provide related information in situations such as movement of service between smart access points verification of spatial service availability or availability of service based on space for a corresponding smart access point received from an external service. And the resource controller may also provide a function of responding to diverse error situations by monitoring individual resource.

The resource monitor may provide a function of detecting problems or changes in the corresponding sensor or IoT device by consistently monitoring resource information and a function of maintaining a related service by using a similar device or other neighboring devices.

The resource manager may provide a function of managing IoT devices that are registered to the smart access point and a function of managing space information. And the resource manager may update information on a corresponding device i.e. smart access point device and information on the respective space which are received from the smart access point in the resource status database DB .

In case a service for controlling space and device is being provided from the smart AP service platform the instance manager may provide a function of calling the corresponding service.

The resource status data may include information on the smart access point e.g. information on units of data being generated from an IoT application and information on a space of a smart access point a service function being provided from the smart AP service platform . For example information on a main space of the smart access point may include information which is received when an E mail address of the smart access point is being assigned or issued e.g. address information of the corresponding space position information of a space existing in a building nickname for space information space information manager account application information of spatial information and so on. 

The spatial smart AP controller may manage spatial situation control information in accordance with physical logical and relative perspectives between smart access points. The spatial smart AP controller may combine information on the connected smart access point so as to generate a logical physical map between the smart access points and based upon the generated Map the spatial smart AP controller may provide a function of determining whether or not mutual control between resources of the smart access points has been performed based upon the generated map. At this point the spatial smart AP controller may include a Radio Map Generator a Logical Map Mapper and a Relation Manager .

The radio map generator may configure spatial information radio map information physical location information of the smart access point between smart access points in an explicit format by using location information registered by the user manager or in an implicit format based upon a radio signal.

The logical map mapper may provide a function of combining diverse information that can identify locations such as radio map information user input information IP address tag information of devices registered to the smart access point and so on and mapping location information of the smart access point to a location of an actual environment Geographic Information System GIS information and to a relative location within individual buildings.

The relation manager may provide a function of establishing relations between each of the resources based upon information on sensors and or IoT devices which are respectively registered to each smart access point. For example the relation between resources may be used for searching replaceable information when an interference or malfunction is detected or may be used for transmitting available control information that can be connected to a neighboring smart access point when an event corresponding to the user s movement occurs in order to provide service continuity and for verifying whether or not the corresponding service function is available for usage.

For example in case the smart access point detects an interference or problem in the sensors and or IoT devices the smart access point may request the smart AP service platform for a reconfiguration of the related service. At this point the smart AP service platform may replace and use information on the sensors or IoT devices which belong to the same smart access point or to a neighboring smart access point and which have the same or similar information as the already existing sensors and or IoT devices based upon the information generated by the spatial smart AP controller .

The database controller may store and manage individual information. The database controller may include a smart access point information database Smart AP Info. DB and the above described resource status database Resource Status DB .

Referring to step to step show an exemplary procedure for performing initial user access authentication and registration of information on devices linked to smart access points.

In step the smart access point or device of the user may request for a user device registration to the smart AP service platform . The user device registration request may be processed by the smart AP controller . Herein the user may be the manager of the smart access point .

In step the device of the user may transmit information related to the smart access point. For example in accordance with the request for a user device registration the smart AP service platform may request the smart access point to provide information related to the smart access point. And with respect to such request the smart access point may provide the smart AP service platform with the requested information related to the smart access point.

In step the smart AP controller may request interconnected or linked device information to the smart access point and then the smart AP controller may request the resource controller to analyze the received interconnected device information.

In step the resource controller may analyze the interconnected device information and then the resource controller may register the analyzed interconnected device information to the resource status database .

In step when the terminal of the user approaches one user access point among multiple registered user access points the user access point may request the terminal of the user for user information authentication.

In step the user access point may request the smart AP service platform for user information authentication. For example the user information authentication may be processed by the exposure controller .

In step the resource controller may search for and extract available service information which can be provided based upon user information.
