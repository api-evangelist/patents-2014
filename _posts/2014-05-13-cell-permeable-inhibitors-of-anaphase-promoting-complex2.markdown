This invention was made with U.S. Government support under National Institutes of Health grant RO1 GM66492. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

This disclosure relates generally to the fields of oncology and disorders associated with cell division.

The contents of the text file named 29297 094F01USSeqList.txt which was created on Jul. 18 2014 and is 7 KB in size are thereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

Conventional antiproliferative agents used in the treatment of cancer are generally grouped as compounds which affect the integrity of nucleic acid polymers e.g. by binding alkylating inducing strand breaks intercalating between base pairs or affecting enzymes which maintain the integrity and function of DNA and RNA and compounds that bind to proteins to inhibit enzymatic action e.g. antimetabolites or the function of structural proteins necessary for cellular integrity e.g. antitubulin agents . Other antiproliferative drugs include those that block steroid hormone action for the treatment of hormone dependent cancer photochemically activated agents radiation sensitizers and protectors. Many of these agents are associated with adverse side effects.

The disclosure encompasses Anaphase Promoting Complex Cyclosome APC inhibitors as anticancer agents and improves upon the success of known anti cancer agents such as taxanes in treating a wide variety of different cancers. A prodrug of TAME proTAME and an apcin act synergistically to inhibit the APC by two different mechanisms. The compositions and methods are useful to treat a subject who is diagnosed as comprising a tumor having comprised a tumor or at risk of developing a primary tumor or a metastasis from a primary tumor. The subject is a human patient a companion animal such as a dog or cat a performance animal such as a race horse or livestock animal such as a cow goat or fowl.

The synergism of for instance proTAME and apcin is unexpected. Provided the individual activities of proTAME and apcin when individually contacted to cells it was anticipated that the combination of TAME proTAME and apcin would be ineffective to induce a mitotic arrest because in cells apcin inactivates the SAC which TAME proTAME requires to inhibit the APC. The disclosure provides the first evidence that the combination of proTAME and apcin induces cell cycle arrest by superior and unexpected means.

Protein machines are multi subunit protein complexes that orchestrate highly regulated biochemical tasks. An example is the Anaphase Promoting Complex Cyclosome APC C a thirteen subunit ubiquitin ligase that initiates the metaphase anaphase transition and mitotic exit by targeting proteins such as securin and cyclin B1 for ubiquitin dependent destruction by the proteasome. The APC C represents a target for cancer therapy because blocking mitotic exit is an effective approach for inducing tumor cell death. APC C activation in mitosis requires binding of Cdc20 which forms a co receptor with the APC C to recognize substrates containing a Destruction box D box . The data provided in this disclosure demonstrate that APC C dependent proteolysis and mitotic exit can be inhibited synergistically by simultaneously disrupting two protein protein interactions within the APC C Cdc20 substrate ternary complex. The studies described in this disclosure identified a small molecule called apcin APC inhibitor also known as cyclinal and R7 which binds to Cdc20 and competitively inhibits the association of D box containing substrates. Analysis of the crystal structure of the apcin Cdc20 complex indicates that apcin occupies the D box binding pocket on the side face of the WD40 domain. The ability of apcin to block mitotic exit is amplified synergistically by co addition of TAME a small molecule that blocks the interaction between Cdc20 and the APC C. Thus simultaneous disruption of multiple weak protein protein interactions is an effective approach for inactivating a protein machine.

Taxanes bind microtubules and activate the spindle checkpoint which can arrest cells in mitosis and induce cell death. However taxane treated cells can exit mitosis before dying through a process of mitotic slippage that results from incomplete inhibition of the APC by the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint SAC . Variability in the relative rates of mitotic slippage compared to mitotic cell death may explain the variability in sensitivity of cell lines and tumors to taxanes and mitotic kinesin inhibitors.

Direct inhibition of APC is a more effective way of inducing mitotic arrest than stimulating the SAC. For example knockdown of Cdc20 which is an activator of APC by RNAi induces prolongs mitotic arrest and cell death but only if Cdc20 is reduced to very low levels. This approach to inducing cell death shows much less variability across different cancer cell lines compared to taxane treatment. Furthermore studies in mice demonstrate that elimination of Cdc20 function can lead to very effective tumor regression in animals.

The small molecules of the disclosure and combinations thereof inhibit APCby pharmacologic approaches to recapitulate the effects of Cdc20 knockdown or knockout. The cell permeable prodrug of TAME proTAME is unexpectedly effective at inducing mitotic arrest in cells. One explanation for the effectiveness of proTAME is that proTAME interferes with the process of SAC inactivation. Together proTAME and the SAC synergize to produce very strong inhibition of APC activity. For example mitotic arrest induced by taxol requires ongoing protein synthesis in mitosis because APC dependent proteolysis is not fully inhibited by the SAC. In contrast proTAME causes more profound APC inhibition such that mitotic arrest is independent of protein synthesis. These discoveries explain why direct APC inhibition is more effective at inducing prolonged mitotic arrest and cell death than microtubule inhibition.

Importantly although proTAME induces mitotic arrest in cell lines with a strong SAC TAME and proTAME are less effective in cells with a weak SAC. While cyclinal also known as apcin and R7 is sufficient to inhibit the APC and induce mitotic arrest in extracts cyclinal has an unexpectedly opposite effect in cells. In cells cyclinal on its own only weakly inhibits APC and surprisingly inactivates the SAC. For this reason it was anticipated that the combination of TAME proTAME and cyclinal would be ineffective to induce a mitotic arrest because in cells cyclinal inactivates the SAC which TAME proTAME requires to inhibit the APC. Stated differently in cells because cyclinal inactivates the SAC the co administration of cyclinal with TAME proTAME was expected to create an environment in which the TAME proTAME molecule would be ineffective. Moreover when cyclinal is administered to cells alone cyclinal actually accelerates progression through mitosis. Therefore unexpectedly when cells are treated with the combination of TAME proTAME and cyclinal a profound mitotic arrest is induced. Data provided herein show that this synergistic effect occurs because TAME proTAME and cyclinal both inhibit binding of Cdc20 to the APC and therefore inhibit APC activity. TAME proTAME and cyclinal interfere with APC Cdc20 binding at two independent points TAME proTAME blocks the IR tail Apc3 interaction whereas cyclinal blocks the WD40 D box interaction . Thus the combination inhibits multiple redundant interactions between APC and Cdc20 leading to a complete inhibition of APC activation.

The combination of TAME proTAME and cyclinal induces a mitotic arrest that is independent of the SAC. Therefore when TAME proTAME is provided in combination with cyclinal the dependence of TAME proTAME on the SAC is eliminated. This is also in contrast to taxane based therapies which directly activate the SAC but not the underlying machinery of the cell cycle. Agents that inactivate the SAC do not release the mitotic arrest induced by the synergistic combination of TAME proTAME and cyclinal. Therefore the disclosure identifies a direct method of inhibiting APC that does not depend on the SAC.

One of the most substantial obstacles to developing the APC inhibitory combination of the disclosure TAME proTAME and cyclinal was the desire to pharmacologically recapitulate the reduction of Cdc20 required to induce mitotic arrest and cell death but which had previously only been demonstrated using RNAi technology. In part because the APC inhibitory combination of the disclosure recapitulates this knockdown of Cdc20 expression pharmacologically the disclosure provides an exciting break through. Moreover in sharp contrast to the most relied upon anti cancer drugs currently available including taxane derivatives the combination of TAME proTAME and cyclinal induces a mitotic arrest that is independent of any cell cycle checkpoint. The effectiveness of a taxane based treatment is dependent upon the status of the mitotic checkpoint in the cell which cannot be empirically determined prior to treatment. Accordingly if the aberrant cell proliferation observed by any given cell or cancer cell does not result from a checkpoint malfunction or if the checkpoint is perturbed in an unexpected or taxane independent manner then a taxane based treatment would be ineffective. Furthermore the efficacy of a therapy that is dependent upon check point or SAC status is unpredictable. Critically the APC inhibitory combination of proTAME and cyclinal produces a profound mitotic arrest that does not require the SAC or any other checkpoint. By inhibiting Cdc20 binding to the APC with TAME while simultaneously suppressing substrate binding to Cdc20 with cyclinal the synergistic combination of TAME proTAME and cyclinal completely disables APCfunction producing the pharmacologic equivalent of a Cdc20 knockout. The efficacy of the mitotic arrest induced by the combination of TAME proTAME and cyclinal does not depend upon the mechanism within the cell that caused proliferation to become misregulated or unregulated because cell proliferation whether it occurs at an appropriate or inappropriate time requires entry into the cell cycle which is the target of the combination of TAME proTAME and cyclinal.

This discovery provides an entirely new approach to treating cancer induction of a true cell cycle arrest by directly disabling the cell cycle machinery. Mitosis is an inherently pro apoptotic state and cell death in mitosis occurs independently of p53 status suggesting that induction of mitotic arrest may be an effective mechanism for killing all tumor cells. Because the combined use of proTAME and cyclinal can induce mitotic arrest independent of checkpoint response it is more effective at inducing cell death than other strategies that arrest cells indirectly by damaging DNA or the mitotic spindle. By combining APC inhibitors with drugs including but not limited to a nutlin or rapamycin that induce cell cycle arrest of normal cells in interphase tumor cells are selectively arrested in mitosis while sparing normal cells.

Compositions of the disclosure include proTAME or the combination of proTAME and apcin. These compositions are both effective for inducing mitotic arrest in cells however the mechanisms by which this arrest occurs differ. Importantly proTAME and apcin have apparently opposite effects when they are provided alone compared to a condition in which they are provided in combination. This apparent contradiction provides the basis for the unexpected and synergistic effects observed when proTAME and apcin are administered in combination.

The disclosure provides a composition including a prodrug of tosyl L arginine methylester TAME and apcin. The prodrug diffuses across the plasma membrane of a cell and decreases cell proliferation by inhibiting mitosis. Once inside the cell the prodrug is processed to yield the active agent TAME. The prodrug is formulated into a pharmaceutical composition which includes the prodrug and a physiologically acceptable excipient. Preferably the prodrug is a TAME derivative in which a guanidino group is linked to a protecting group. The protecting group is an enzyme cleavable group such as a carbamate group that is cleaved by an intracellular enzyme. The guianidino substituent of TAME occurs in the arginine residue. An exemplary prodrug is an esterase activatable N N bis acyloxymethyl carbamate derivative of the parent molecule TAME.

In certain embodiments proTAME and its parent molecule once inside the cell TAME contact a component of a tetratricopeptide repeats TPR subcomplex of an APC. Exemplary components of a TPR subcomplex include but are not limited to APC3 Cdc27 APC6 APC7 or APC8. In a preferred embodiment proTAME TAME blocks the interaction of Cdc20 with APC through the interaction of the IR tail of Cdc20 with APC3.

The phospholipid membrane of cells limits the permeation of molecules into a cell. The membrane acts as a barrier to passive diffusion of water soluble molecules and substances that dissolve in lipids pass more easily into the cell. The prodrugs described herein are lipophilic uncharged esterase activatable prodrugs of guanidine containing molecules. The prodrug has improved cell permeability and once inside the cell is converted to active TAME by esterase s . The prodrug is characterized as at least 10 20 50 2 fold 5 fold 20 fold or more membrane permeable e.g. eukaryotic cell membrane permeable compared to the parent drug.

A prodrug is a molecule which is converted to a therapeutically active molecule after administration. For example prodrug e.g. proTAME converted to TAME after gaining access into a mammalian cell. Conversion of the prodrug to the active drug may occur by hydrolysis of an ester group or some other biologically labile group. Generally but not necessarily a prodrug is inactive or less active than the therapeutically active molecule to which it is converted. The prodrug is characterized by a protecting group that is associated with or linked to an inhibitor of the anaphase promoting complex APC . The presence of the group e.g. a carbamate group on a guanidine substituent of arginine increases cellular uptake or transport across a cellular membrane e.g. plasma membrane or nuclear membrane . The prodrug has additional advantages such as improved solubility oral absorption cellular targeting or specificity stability half life or blood brain barrier permeability of the inhibitory molecule. Alternatively or in addition prodrugs decrease the degradation immunogenicity toxicity or required dosage compared to the parent molecule.

Also within the disclosure is a method for manufacturing an anti proliferative agent such as a cell permeable inhibitor of APC by introducing an amino protecting group e.g. a carbamate protecting group onto a guanidino substituent of an arginine residue of TAME. The carbamate protecting group is introduced by contacting said TAME with N N bis benzyloxycarbonyl S methylisourea.

The phrase pharmaceutically acceptable refers to those compounds materials compositions carriers and or dosage forms which are within the scope of sound medical judgment suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity irritation allergic response or other problem or complication commensurate with a reasonable benefit risk ratio.

 Pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound means a salt that is pharmaceutically acceptable and that possesses the desired pharmacological activity of the parent compound.

Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include but are not limited to mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed for example from non toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example such conventional non toxic salts include but are not limited to those derived from inorganic and organic acids selected from 2 acetoxybenzoic 2 hydroxyethane sulfonic acetic ascorbic benzene sulfonic benzoic bicarbonic carbonic citric edetic ethane disulfonic 1 2 ethane sulfonic fumaric glucoheptonic gluconic glutamic glycolic glycollyarsanilic hexylresorcinic hydrabamic hydrobromic hydrochloric hydroiodic hydroxymaleic hydroxynaphthoic isethionic lactic lactobionic lauryl sulfonic maleic malic mandelic methane sulfonic napsylic nitric oxalic pamoic pantothenic phenylacetic phosphoric polygalacturonic propionic salicyclic stearic subacetic succinic sulfamic sulfanilic sulfuric tannic tartaric toluene sulfonic and the commonly occurring amine acids e.g. glycine alanine phenylalanine arginine etc.

Other examples include hexanoic acid cyclopentane propionic acid pyruvic acid malonic acid 3 4 hydroxybenzoyl benzoic acid cinnamic acid 4 chlorobenzenesulfonic acid 2 naphthalenesulfonic acid 4 toluenesulfonic acid camphorsulfonic acid 4 methylbicyclo 2.2.2 oct 2 ene 1 carboxylic acid 3 phenylpropionic acid trimethylacetic acid tertiary butylacetic acid muconic acid and the like. The disclosure also encompasses salts formed when an acidic proton present in the parent compound either is replaced by a metal ion e.g. an alkali metal ion an alkaline earth ion or an aluminum ion or coordinates with an organic base such as ethanolamine diethanolamine triethanolamine tromethamine N methylglucamine and the like.

All references to pharmaceutically acceptable salts include solvent addition forms solvates or crystal forms polymorphs as defined herein of the same salt.

Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present disclosure can be synthesized from a parent compound that contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent or in a mixture of the two non aqueous media like ether ethyl acetate ethanol isopropanol or acetonitrile can be used. Lists of suitable salts are found in 18th ed. Mack Publishing Company 1990 . For example salts can include but are not limited to the hydrochloride and acetate salts of the aliphatic amine containing hydroxyl amine containing and imine containing compounds of the present disclosure.

Apcin blocks the interaction of the WD40 region on Cdc20 with the D box sequence on potential APC substrates e.g. cyclin B1 securin and therefore competes with substrates for binding to the WD40 region. Thus apcin blocks Cdc20 mediated activation of the APC by an independent yet functionally redundant pathway to the IR tail APC3 interaction that is blocked by proTAME TAME.

The combination of TAME proTAME and apcin inhibits an activity of an anaphase promoting complex cyclosome APC . In some embodiments the combination of TAME proTAME and apcin inhibits the ability of Cdc20 to activate APC and therefore the ability of APC to degrade substrates. Blockade of APC activity causes a profound mitotic arrest.

Subjects of the disclosure either present a sign or symptom of a cell proliferative disease and or have been diagnosed with a cell proliferative disease. A sign is an external and visible indication that something is not right in the body. Signs are signals that can be observed by family members colleagues and medical professionals. For instance a fever abnormal or labored breathing or abnormal lung sounds heard through a stethoscope are examples of signs. A symptom is a different kind of signal of disease illness injury or that something is not right in the body. Symptoms are only felt or noticed by the person who has them but are not usually obvious to the outside observer. For example fatigue pain and feeling short of breath are examples of symptoms.

Typical signs or symptoms include but are not limited to tumors benign or malignant pain for instance as a tumor grows and exerts pressure on surrounding vasculature and organs fever fatigue weight loss as the proliferating cells drain energy resources from the body changes to immune system function decreased immune function or autoimmune episodes presence of secreted factors in the bloodstream from a cell mass or the metastasis thereof weakness dizziness and blood clots particularly in the legs unexplained bleeding the appearance of wounds or sores and optionally the inability of these wounds to heal and visible changes to the skin e.g. melanoma .

The disclosure provides new insights into APC regulation and indicates that the APC is a druggable target amenable to pharmacologic intervention. Most cells that are mitotically arrested following proTAME treatment undergo cell death as is observed for microtubule inhibitors. The combination of TAME proTAME and cyclinal induces an unexpected and profound mitotic arrest that is independent of cell checkpoint status or spinal assembly checkpoint SAC activity function. Therefore the combinatorial therapy of TAME proTAME and cyclinal is effective in cancer cells regardless of the mechanism by which cell proliferation became unregulated or misregulated in these cells.

Lower doses of proTAME induce mitotic delay rather than cell death suggesting that APC inhibitors may be useful for restoring normal chromosome segregation in cases where spindle checkpoint function is compromised. For example APC inhibitors may be useful for rescuing mitotic failure in preimplantation embryos generated through in vitro fertilization. Given that APC also regulates functions in the central nervous system and controls rates of axon growth inhibition of Cdh1 association with the APC may also be of therapeutic benefit in the treatment of neurological disease.

The Anaphase Promoting Complex Cyclosome APC is a multi subunit ubiquitin E3 ligase that promotes anaphase onset and mitotic exit by ubiquitinating cyclin B and securin to target them for proteolysis by the 26S proteasome Pines J. Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol 12 427 438 2011 . APC activity requires an activator. In mitosis Cdc20 is the activator while in interphase this role is taken by a homologous protein Cdh1 Pesin J. A. Orr Weaver T. L. Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol 24 475 499 2008 . The activator contains a C terminal seven WD40 repeats domain that has been shown to interact with a motif known as the Destruction box D box an APC specific degron on APC substrates Kraft C. et al. Mol Cell 18 543 553 2005 . The APC recognizes the D box through a co receptor formed by the activator and another core APC subunit Apc10 Buschhorn B. A. et al. Nat Struct Mol Biol 18 6 13 2011 da Fonseca P. C. et al. Nature 470 274 278 2011 . Although additional APC specific degrons such as the KEN box exist and might be important for APC activity in late mitosis and interphase Nguyen H. G. et al. Mol Cell Biol 25 4977 4992 2005 Pfleger C. M. Kirschner M. W. Genes Dev 14 655 665 2000 the D box is essential for APC Cdc20 driven degradation of cyclin B and securin prior to anaphase onset Hagting A. et al. J Cell Biol 157 1125 1137 2002 Clute P. Pines J. Nat Cell Biol 1 82 87 1999 .

In prometaphase the APC is activated by Cdc20 leading to ubiquitination and degradation of Nek2A and cyclin A. However ubiquitination of other APC substrates is inhibited by the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint SAC until chromosomes have achieved proper bipolar attachment to the mitotic spindle. Once the SAC is satisfied ubiquitination and degradation of securin and cyclin B lead to chromosome segregation and mitotic exit. In telophase another APC activator Cdh1 replaces Cdc20 and maintains APC activity during G1.

Cdc20 and Cdh1 are important for recruiting substrates to the APC. The activator proteins share several evolutionarily conserved motifs including an N terminal C box comprising the consensus sequence DRFYIPXR SEQ ID NO 1 seven WD40 repeats also known as WD or beta transducin repeats of about 40 amino acids often terminating in a WD dipeptide and containing 4 16 repeating units that together form a circular beta propellar structure and a C terminal IR tail a C terminal region including one or more IR dipeptide motifs . Whereas the WD40 domain may interact simultaneously with substrates and the APC the C box and the IR tail are specifically involved in APC binding. The IR tail of Cdh1 interacts with multiple APC subunits including Cdc27 and Apc7. Deletion of the IR tail of Cdh1 compromises its ability to activate human APC in vitro and is lethal in budding yeast lacking Sic1. However deletion of IR tail of Cdc20 does not affect the viability of wild type budding yeast and thus does not seem to be strictly required for APC activation. Instead the IR tail may be important for regulating Cdc20 abundance as Cdc20 IR accumulates to higher levels than the wild type protein. Thus while the IR tail seems to be critical for Cdh1 recruitment and activation of the APC the specific role of Cdc20 s IR tail in APC binding and activation remains unclear.

The Spindle Assembly Checkpoint SAC ensures that the replicated sister chromatids faithfully segregate into the two daughter cells during mitosis Musacchio A. Salmon E. D. Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol 8 379 393 2007 . During prometaphase the kinetochores of each sister chromatid are attached to microtubule fibers emanating from one of the two opposite spindle poles a configuration known as bi orientation. Bi oriented chromosomes then become aligned on an equator plane of the cell in a process named congression and the completion of congression is the hallmark of metaphase. The SAC senses unattached or improperly attached kinetochores and restrains the APC from ubiquitinating securin and cyclin B1 before metaphase is achieved. The effector of SAC mediated APC inhibition is a complex known as the Mitotic Checkpoint Complex MCC that consists of stoichiometric amounts of Mad2 Cdc20 BubR1 and Bub3 Sudakin V. et al. J Cell Biol 154 925 936 2001 . Although Cdc20 as a component of the MCC can still bind to the APC Herzog F. et al. Science 323 1477 1481 2009 Zeng X. et al. Cancer Cell 18 382 395 2010 it is not capable of promoting APC substrate ubiquitination but instead seems to be susceptible to auto ubiquitination Reddy S. K. et al. Nature 446 921 925 2007 Stegmeier F. et al. Nature 446 876 881 2007 . The mechanism of MCC mediated APC inhibition remains an unanswered question in cell biology. The MCC may alter the way that Cdc20 binds to the APC Herzog F. et al. Science 323 1477 1481 2009 . Moreover it has been proposed that budding yeast Mad3 may act as a pseudo substrate since it contains several APC degrons including two N terminal KEN boxes and one C terminal D box and competes with a canonical substrate for Cdc20 binding Burton J. L. Solomon M. J. Genes Dev 21 655 667 2007 . Interestingly the roles of these degrons in Mad3 do not seem to be equivalent as KEN box mutations fully abrogate Mad3 function but the D box mutation is better tolerated Burton J. L. Solomon M. J. Genes Dev 21 655 667 2007 . The importance of the KEN box is also confirmed in mouse and human cells but the role of the BubR1 D box has not been evaluated in higher organisms Elowe S. et al. J Cell Sci 123 84 94 2010 Malureanu L. A. et al. Dev Cell 16 118 131 2009 Rahmani Z. et al. J Cell Biol 187 597 605 2009 .

Microtubule inhibitors are used as anti mitotic chemotherapy drugs for cancer treatment Montero A. et al. Lancet Oncol 6 229 239 2005 . They disrupt microtubule functions and activate the SAC to induce mitotic arrest in cells. Direct APC inhibition equally induces mitotic arrest without side effects associated with microtubule inhibition and therefore represents a better route for anti mitotic drug development Zeng X. et al. Cancer Cell 18 382 395 2010 Montero A. et al. Lancet Oncol 6 229 239 2005 . To identify potential small molecule APC inhibitors a high throughput chemical screen was conducted to search for compounds that can stabilize a cyclin B1 luciferase reporter in mitotic egg extract Verma R. et al. Science 306 117 120 2004 . TAME and cyclinal were among the most potent hits from the screen. TAME acts as a structural analog of the IR tail of Cdc20 and competes for the same binding site on the APC Zeng X. et al. Cancer Cell 18 382 395 2010 . In the absence of APC substrates such as cyclin B1 TAME strongly inhibits the binding of free Cdc20 to the APC and induces auto ubiquitination followed by dissociation of Cdc20 pre bound to the APC. However APC substrates promote free Cdc20 binding to the APC in the presence of TAME presumably because forming the D box co receptor with Apc10 provides one addition contact point between APC and Cdc20 to render the IR dependent interaction non essential. A cell permeable TAME prodrug proTAME induces a prolonged mitotic arrest in cells. However the arrest is strongly dependent on the SAC suggesting the major mechanism of proTAME induced mitotic arrest is prevention of SAC inactivation instead of direct APC inhibition Zeng X. et al. Cancer Cell 18 382 395 2010 . Because some tumor cells frequently have a defective SAC response Bharadwaj R. Yu H. Oncogene 23 2016 2027 2004 a method of APC inhibition was developed that induces a prolonged mitotic arrest independent on the SAC. TAME s mechanism suggests that complete inhibition of Cdc20 binding to the APC and APC activation may be achieved if the IR dependent interaction between the APC and Cdc20 and the D box dependent interaction between the substrate and Cdc20 are disrupted simultaneously. This synchronous inhibition leads to complete APC inactivation and renders the mitotic arrest independent of the SAC as shown in cells depleted of Cdc20 by RNAi Huang H. C. et al. Cancer Cell 16 347 358 2009 .

Cyclinal competes with the D box for Cdc20 binding. Cyclinal on its own is insufficient to induce a mitotic arrest in cells. Moreover it overrides prolonged mitotic arrest induced by microtubule inhibitors which is shown to be a consequence of disruption of the BubR1 Cdc20 interaction. Co addition of TAME and cyclinal strongly inhibits Cdc20 binding to the APC even in the presence of APC substrates and induces an extremely robust mitotic arrest that is resistant to SAC inactivation and Cdk inhibition.

The examples provided herein delineate the mechanism of action of cyclinal a small molecule inhibitor of cyclin proteolysis discovered in a phenotypic screen in extract. Cyclinal competes with the D box on APC substrates for Cdc20 binding and increases the Kof the APC in substrate ubiqutination assays. In SAC deficient cells cyclinal induces a transient delay in mitotic exit. However in SAC proficient cells cyclinal promotes premature mitotic exit in the presence of microtubule inhibitors but this does not happen after 5 h into mitosis. Cyclinal compromises the SAC by perturbing a D box dependent interaction between BubR1 and Cdc20 which results in reduced assembly of the MCC and stabilization of Cdc20. Cyclinal and TAME synergize to inhibit Cdc20 binding to the APC in the presence of APC substrates which results in complete inhibition of APC activation . The prolonged mitotic arrest induced by cyclinal proTAME is therefore fully resistant to methods of inducing mitotic exit such as SAC inactivation or Cdk inhibition.

The D box and KEN box are the most commonly found APC degrons. Although the canonical model proposes that Cdc20 specifically recognizes the D box whereas Cdh1 can recognize both the D box and the KEN box Pfleger et al. Genes Dev 15 2396 2407 2001 recent evidence suggests that Cdc20 may also interact with the KEN box. For instance the KEN boxes on BubR1 are critical for Cdc20 association and SAC function Burton J. L. Solomon M. J. Genes Dev 21 655 667 2007 Elowe S. et al. J Cell Sci 123 84 94 2010 Malureanu L. A. et al. Dev Cell 16 118 131 2009 Rahmani Z. et al. J Cell Biol 187 597 605 2009 King E. M. et al. PLoS One 2 e342 2007 and the degradation of a KEN box APC substrate CENP F seems to be dependent on Cdc20 Gurden M. D. et al. J Cell Sci 123 321 330 2010 . Structural studies suggest that for Cdh1 the recognition mechanism for the D box and the KEN box must be different since the D box is bound between the WD40 domain of Cdh1 and Apc10 whereas the KEN box seems to bind elsewhere da Fonseca P. C. et al. Nature 470 274 278 2011 . The fact that cyclinal compromises the SAC in a way that is consistent with selective perturbation of the D box but not the KEN box interaction between Cdc20 and BubR1 indicates that there are distinct binding sites for the D box and the KEN box on Cdc20 and cyclinal selectively blocks the D box binding site but leaves the KEN box binding site available.

For 4 000 000 cells 100 l lysis buffer was used. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min to remove cell debris. H TAME 15 Ci mmol was added to cell lysate to a final concentration of 200 nM. For each aliquot of 5 l beads 100 l lysate was used for APC immunoprecipitation at 4 C. for 1 h. Protein A beads without Cdc27 antibody was used as a negative control to measure background level of binding mock IP . The beads were washed quickly with lysis buffer high salt 500 mM sodium chloride in addition to above components twice and lysis buffer twice. The beads were then transferred to scintillation vials mixed with scintillation fluid and radioactivity measured by scintillation counting. Alternatively the lysate was subjected to one or two rounds of immunoprecipitation before the addition of H TAME. For competition assays 10 M unlabeled TAME or AAME was added along with 200 nM H TAME into the lysate. Specific binding under each condition was obtained by subtracting the value of mock IP.

Interphase egg extract was prepared from eggs laid overnight according to the protocol of Murray Murray A. W. Methods Cell Biol. 36 581 605 1991 with the exception that eggs were activated with 2 g ml calcium ionophore A23187 for 30 minutes prior to the crushing spin.

The coding region of human Cdc20 containing residues 161 477 Cdc20 WD40 was amplified by PCR and cloned into the modified pFastBac vector. Recombinant baculovirus encoding the N terminal His6 tagged Cdc20 protein was constructed using the Bac to Bac system Invitrogen according to manufacturer s protocols. A tobacco etch virus TEV protease cleavage site was introduced into the N terminus of Cdc20. Sf9 insect cells were infected with the Cdc20 baculovirus and harvested at about 60 hours post infection. His6 tagged Cdc20 WD40 was purified with Ni NTA agarose resin Qiagen and cleaved with TEV protease to remove the His tag. The Cdc20 WD40 protein was further purified by anion exchange chromatography with a Mono Q column followed by size exclusion chromatography with a Superdex 200 column GE Healthcare . Purified Cdc20 WD40 was concentrated to 4 5 mg ml in the Superdex 200 column buffer containing 25 mM Tris pH 8.5 150 mM NaCl 1 mM MgCl 5 glycerol and 5 mM TCEP.

The Cdc20 WD40 protein was crystallized at 20 C. using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method with a reservoir solution containing 0.1 M MES pH 6.5 15 w v PEG 6000 and 5 MPD. The Cdc20 WD40 crystals were transferred to a new 2 l sitting drop with a reservoir solution containing 0.1 M MES pH 6.5 and 20 w v PEG 6000 and soaked for 3 5 hours to get rid of bound MPD. Apcin compound was dissolved into DMSO and added to the same drop at the final concentration of 5 mM. After overnight soaking the crystals were cryo protected in a solution containing 0.1 M MES pH 6.5 20 w v PEG 6000 10 glycerol and 5 mM apcin and then flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. Crystals diffracted to a minimum Bragg spacing d of about 2.1 and exhibited the symmetry of space group P2with cell dimensions of a 41 b 87 c 48 and 113 and contained two Cdc20 molecules per asymmetric unit.

Parental A549 U2O5 and hTERT RPE1 cells were purchased from ATCC. DLD 1 cells were purchased from Sigma. For hTERT RPE1 A549 and U205 cells stable cell lines expressing H2B GFP were derived using described methods Sigoillot F. D. et al. A time series method for automated determination of changes in mitotic and interphase duration from time lapse movies. PLoS One 6 e25511 2011 and used in the experiments. DLD 1 cells were used without further modification. Cell lines were tested for contamination Lonza kit LT07 218 after they were derived and were found negative. For each cell line asynchronous cells were resuspended to a density of 3.75 10cells ml. A WellMate dispenser Thermo Scientific was used to distribute 40 L of suspension to each well of a black clear bottom 384 well plate Corning 3712 . Plates were sealed with breathable white rayon sealing tape Nunc 241205 during plating and subsequent incubation. After 24 hours incubation the cells were treated with indicated concentrations of apcin and proTAME dissolved in DMSO. After 18 hours cells were fixed and stained directly without wash steps to avoid loss of mitotic cells by adding 10 l of 6 concentrated fixing staining reagent 60 Formalin 0.6 Triton X 100 and 1.5 ug mL Hoechst 33342 in DPBS . The plates were sealed with aluminum sealing tape Nunc 276014 and incubated at room temperature for 40 min before imaging. Plates were then imaged at 4 positions per well using an ImageXpress Micro Molecular Devices high throughput microscope using a 10 objective. Cell images were processed automatically in ImageJ to identify the nuclei and count the number of nuclei and maximum intensity of each nucleus in each image. The output files from ImageJ for each treatment were pooled and the cumulative frequency curve of maximum intensity for the cell population in each treatment was computed using Matlab. An intensity threshold was set based on the mitotic fraction in the wells treated with DMSO to separate mitotic cells from interphase cells. The interphase fraction for each treatment was indicated by the fraction below the threshold on the cumulative frequency plot.

In order to detect departures from Bliss independence across the matrix of proTAME and apcin doses a separate Poisson regression was fit to the count of cells not in mitosis for each dose combination and it was tested whether a regression model that allows for departures from Bliss independence the synergy model is a significantly better fit to the data than a regression model that does not allow departures from Bliss independence the Bliss model .

A Poisson regression is a natural framework to test Bliss independence for count data. The standard calculation of the predicted effect of a drug combination under Bliss independence using the fractional product method of Webb Webb J. L. Enzyme and metabolic inhibitors. Academic Press 1963 is Fa Fb where is the null effect Fa is the proportional reduction in counts attributable to compound A and Fb is the proportional reduction in counts attributable to compound B. In the Poisson regression model the following were fit log where Yis the count of cells below threshold for each well i Nis the total cells for each well I Bis the intercept Bis the effect of compound A alone TAME Bis the effect of compound B alone APCIN and Bis the parameter that captures departure from Bliss independence. A is an indicator variable for the presence of compound A and B is an indicator variable for the presence of compound B.

Exponentiating and rearranging it is easy to see that in the fractional product method is equivalent to exp B Fa is equivalent to exp B and Fb is equivalent to exp B . Thus it follows that the predicted Bliss independence value in the Poisson regression framework will be exp B B B which is equal to the expected value of the model that does not include a Bterm. To test significance it is possible to compare the likelihood of the data under a model that does not include the Bterm representing the departure from Bliss independence to the likelihood of the data under the synergy model using a standard likelihood ratio test. A significant test indicates statistical support for synergy.

The procedure then is for each TAME dose x x. . . . x in M and each APCIN dose y y. . . y in M to fit the full synergy model and the reduced Bliss model to the data from each of four dose treatment combinations TAME 0 M APCIN 0 M no treatment TAME x M APCIN 0 M TAME only TAME 0 M APCIN y M APCIN only and TAME x M APCIN y M combined action . From the model fits first the significance of the departure from Bliss independence is tested as described above. Then the predicted values for the combined dose under Bliss independence third column as exp B B B and the fitted values under the synergy model second column for the combined dose as exp B B B B which is simply the expected value of the model when both indicator variables are 1 are generated. The difference between these model fits and fourth column represents the degree of departure from Bliss independence with positive values indicating synergy 0 indicating Bliss independence and negative values indicating antagonism. Alternately the value of the parameter Bmay be considered as representing the multiplicative departure from Bliss independence that is Bis what the Bliss independence prediction needs to be multiplied by in order to obtain the expected value of the full model fit.

A separate set of models were fit to each dose combination as described above so independent estimates of departures from Bliss independence for each combination of doses in the dose matrix were generated allowing for detection of complicated patterns of non independence across the dose response surface. In order to retain proper control of the family wise Type I error rate P values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Holm Bonferroni method as implemented in the R function p.adjust. A multiple test corrected P value 

RPE1 H2B GFP or U2OS H2B GFP cells were plated in 24 well glass bottom plates Greiner BioOne 662892 18 24 hours prior to siRNA transfection using RNAiMax Invitrogen . Plates were inserted into a covered chamber supplied with humidified 5 COand mounted onto a motorized microscope stage Prior Scientific . DIC and FITC images were captured at 6 minute intervals for 45 hours using a Nikon Ti inverted fluorescence microscope fitted with a 37 C. enclosed incubation chamber and using a 20 Plan Apo 0.75 NA objective lens. A Hamamatsu ORCA cooled CCD camera collected the images with 2 2 binning using Nikon Elements software version 3.0 . Movies were manually analyzed using Nikon Elements software or ImageJ. Mitotic duration was defined as the time from nuclear envelope breakdown until anaphase in the case of normal mitosis or until exit from prolonged mitosis as indicated by cytoplasmic blebbing accompanied by changes in chromatin as detected by H2B GFP.

To measure efficiency of Mad2 knockdown by siRNA Western blot samples were each prepared from a single well of the 24 well glass bottom plates. Twenty four hours after transfection cells were collected by trypsinization pelleting and resuspension in 2 NuPAGE sample buffer Invitrogen 50 M DTT.

In order to detect differences in mitotic duration among cells in the live cell imaging screen a stratified Cox proportional hazards model Cox D. R. Regression models and life tables. J Royal Statistics Soc B34 187 220 1972 was fit to censored mitotic duration times where cells that are not observed exiting mitosis or dying in mitosis are censored at the last known time in mitosis . The Cox proportional hazards model is a semiparameteric approach to modeling time to event data in which covariates are assumed to have constant proportional effects over time relative to a baseline hazard function that can take any form. In this case stratification on person the individual who analyzed the movie and date the date the assay was run allow the baseline hazard function to differ across experimental blocks but assume a fixed effect of treatment across experimental blocks. The model is thus exp apcin apcinM proTAME proTAME apcinM proTAME apcin 1 . . . 4 where h t is the hazard function of cell i at time t h t is the baseline hazard for strata j with 4 levels one for each person and date combination apcin proTAME and apcinMare indicator variables for presence or absence of the compounds apcin proTAME and apcin M respectively in cell i proTAME apcinis an indicator variable that is 1 if both proTAME and apcin are present in cell i and 0 otherwise and proTAME apcinMis a similar indicator variable for proTAME apcin M. In this model and represent the effects of apcin apcin M and proTAME alone while and represent the additional non additive effect of the compounds beyond what is predicted from the combination of effects of the two compounds alone. This model was fit separately to cells treated with control siRNA or Mad2 siRNA. All statistical analysis was carried out in R 3.0.0 using the functions available as part of the survival package.

In this model the coefficients represent the log hazard ratios for exiting mitosis between treated and untreated cells. However for ease of interpretation the coefficients are exponentiated to convert them to normal hazard ratios and then multiplied by 100 to convert to percentages relative to DMSO. These hazard ratios which are referred to as mitotic exit rate represent the relative probability that a treated cell in mitosis at time t will exit mitosis in the next time interval compared to an untreated cell. Thus a treatment that has the effect of reducing mitotic exit rate to 50 of the control indicates that at any time point t treated cells in mitosis have only half the chance of exiting mitosis in the next time interval as control cells in mitosis do.

The mitotic exit rates relative to DMSO for each treatment predicted by this model are presented in Tables 4 6 . For ease of interpretation the treatment effects are presented relative to DMSO for all individual compounds and compound combinations. Combination compound effects relative to DMSO are easily obtained from the model as the product of the mitotic exit rates for each individual compound and the synergy effect. Also presented is the parameter which represents the degree of synergy observed for the proTAME apcin treatment combination Table 6 . This coefficient can be interpreted as observed mitotic exit rate in the combined compound treatment relative to the mitotic exit rate expected under Bliss independence. Thus numbers below 100 represent synergy lower mitotic exit rate compared to expectation and numbers above 100 represent antagonism.

In order to verify the fit of these data to the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox regression model the weighted residual test Grambsch P. Therneau T. Proportional hazards tests and diagnostics based on weighted residuals. Biometrika 91 515 526 1994 implemented in the R function cox.zph was used. While a minor deviation from proportionality was observed only for proTAME in the control siRNA treatment rho 0.12027 P 0.002697 as expected based on the biphasic nature of the survival curve for proTAME only in this condition this deviation was eliminated in the Mad2 siRNA trea was found.

Despite the fact that TAME binds to human APC it did not inhibit mitotic division in human HeLa cells. It was speculated that TAME might not be cell permeable due to its positively charged guanidino group. Therefore a cell permeable TAME prodrug was synthesized by modification of the guanidino group Saulnier et al. Bioorgan. Med. Chem. Let. 1994 4 1985 1990 hereby incorporated by reference to produce an N N bis acyloxymethyl carbamate derivative 18 proTAME . Once inside the cell proTAME is cleaved by cellular esterases producing an unstable carbamate intermediate that undergoes decarboxylation to restore the original structure of TAME. It was found that proTAME is rapidly converted to TAME in extract and efficiently inhibits cyclin B luciferase proteolysis . ProTAME is also activated efficiently when added to HeLa cells but conversion was not efficient in all cell lines tested .

The effect of ProTAME on cell division was next determined by live imaging of HeLa cells that express Histone 2B GFP. As a control a prodrug version of AAME proAAME was synthesized . ProTAME induced a dose dependent increase in mitotic duration from 75 minutes for DMSO or proAAME treated cells to 120 minutes for cells treated with 3 M proTAME and C . At this concentration proTAME treated cells formed metaphase plates with normal timing but anaphase onset was delayed. At 12 proTAME treated cells arrested in metaphase for more than 8 hours with most cells dying after the prolonged arrest. At this concentration chromosome congression was also delayed with cells taking 40 minutes on average to achieve metaphase compared to 15 minutes for DMSO treated cells. The delay is potentially a consequence of cyclin A stabilization. Some cells showed abnormal segregation of chromosomes after prolonged arrest suggesting incomplete degradation of securing. At 12 M proAAME had no effect on mitosis or cell viability . It was noted that fluorescence imaging may artifactually shorten the duration of proTAME induced mitotic arrest by enhancing cell death as repeating this experiment by Differential Interference Contrast DIC imaging rather than fluorescence imaging increased the duration of mitotic arrest from 8 to over 10 hours B . Under these imaging conditions late dividing cells those entering mitosis 16 hours after the initiation of the experiment did not arrest in mitosis but rather showed only a modest mitotic delay. Whether this difference reflects proTAME metabolism or whether exposure of cells to proTAME during G1 induces drug resistance is next determined.

The effect of proTAME on the degradation of endogenous APC substrates in synchronized HeLa cells was next determined. Cyclin B and securin were dramatically stabilized by proTAME but not by proAAME . Cyclin A and Nek2A which are both degraded in early mitosis were also stabilized but to a lesser extent. The effects of proTAME on degradation of cyclinB1 GFP or cyclin A2 GFP were also characterized by live cell imaging. In the absence of drug both proteins were degraded during mitosis with cyclin A2 GFP degradation preceding that of cyclin B1 GFP. As expected cyclin B1 GFP was stabilized during nocodazole induced mitotic arrest whereas cyclin A2 GFP was degraded since its degradation is not constrained by the SAC 3 . Consistent with the Western blot results cyclin B1 GFP was stabilized in mitotic cells following proTAME treatment and in fact accumulated to higher levels than in nocodazole treated cells. Furthermore cyclinA2 GFP was robustly stabilized during proTAME induced mitotic arrest strongly suggesting that TAME directly inhibits APC activity and does not stabilize APC substrates simply by activating the SAC.

The ability of proTAME to stabilize cyclin A and other APC substrates suggested that proTAME inhibits APC activation in human cells. To test whether this effect is a consequence of inhibiting Cdc20 binding to the APC HeLa cells were released from a double thymidine block for 10 hours and then treated with MG132 plus proTAME or proAAME for 2 hours. Mitotic cells were collected by shakeoff lysed and the APC was isolated by immunoprecipitation. A 30 reduction was observed in Cdc20 binding to the APC after proTAME treatment . To test if this modest reduction of APC bound Cdc20 resulted in inhibition of APC activity an in vitro ubiquitination assay was performed with APC isolated as described above and it was found that proTAME treatment indeed inhibited APC activity especially the ability of APC to catalyze formation of higher molecular weight ubiquitin conjugates .

ProTAME may induce a sustained mitotic arrest in HeLa cells despite the incomplete blockade of Cdc20 association. In addition to Cdc20 Apc10 Doc1 also has an IR tail and Doc1 has been implicated in substrate recognition and processivity of the APC. However it is not yet clear whether the IR tail of Doc1 is required for APC association or its ability to activate the APC. Alternatively proTAME may interfere with substrate recruitment such as the interaction of the MR tail of Nek2A with the APC.

The ability of proTAME to induce a prolonged mitotic arrest and inhibit APC activation in cells despite producing only a partial reduction of Cdc20 association with the APC suggested that the SAC may be important for the proTAME induced mitotic arrest. One possibility is that in addition to its ability to directly bind to the APC proTAME may nonspecifically perturb microtubules resulting in SAC activation. Mitotic spindle and kinetochore morphology was therefore examined in HeLa cells arrested in mitosis with proTAME or microtubule inhibitors for 2 h.

Whereas nocodazole and taxol strongly perturbed spindle organization proTAME had no measurable effects on spindle morphology spindle kinetochore attachment or tension across kinetochores compared to the DMSO control suggesting that the mitotic arrest observed with proTAME treatment is not a consequence of microtubule perturbation.

To determine whether proTAME induced arrest is SAC dependent Mad2 expression was knocked down with siRNA in synchronized cells and the effects of proTAME or nocodazole on mitosis were analyzed by live cell fluorescence imaging. Mad2 knockdown shortened median mitotic duration from 75 minutes to 15 minutes in DMSO treated cells and shortened nocodazole induced mitotic arrest from 1230 minutes to 30 minutes indicating that the SAC was fully inactivated. Mad2 knockdown also shortened the duration of proTAME induced arrest from 420 minutes to 120 minutes suggesting that proTAME induced arrest is partially dependent on the SAC. However Mad2 knockdown cells remained in mitosis for 2 hours in the presence of proTAME indicating that a significant portion of the arrest is also SAC independent . In support of earlier observations the arrest in Mad2 knockdown cells cannot be a consequence of nonspecific microtubule disruption by proTAME because nocodazole induced microtubule disruption arrested Mad2 knockdown cells for only 30 minutes rather than 2 hours. Furthermore addition of proTAME to nocodazole treated Mad2 knockdown cells extended mitotic arrest from 30 minutes to 150 minutes showing that microtubules are not a direct target of proTAME . A replicate experiment by DIC imaging of asynchronous cells produced similar results B .

The Mad2 dependence of proTAME arrest was also confirmed by measurement of APC substrate levels in synchronized cells by western blotting . RNAi mediated knockdown reduced Mad2 levels by 80 . This was sufficient to inactivate the SAC as measured by phase contrast imaging . Although Mad2 knockdown resulted in efficient override of the mitotic arrest induced by nocodazole cyclin was not efficiently degraded as noted by other investigators Michel L. S. et al. Nature 409 6818 355 2001 suggesting that microtubules may be required for efficient cyclin B proteolysis in human cells. In contrast cyclin B was degraded more efficiently when proTAME treated cells exited mitosis as a consequence of Mad2 depletion . These findings indicate that the mechanisms of mitotic exit in the presence of proTAME and nocodazole are distinct. Other APC substrates were efficiently degraded following Mad2 knockdown in the presence of either nocodazole or proTAME .

To confirm that proTAME directly inhibits APC activation it was determined that the compound restores a normal mitosis in cells lacking Mad2. Thus the effects of proTAME in Mad2 knockdown cells were analyzed in more detail by live cell imaging. Unlike control cells Mad2 knockdown cells initiate anaphase before establishing a metaphase plate because of unconstrained APC activity and slip out of mitosis quickly in the presence of nocodazole . In striking contrast the addition of proTAME allowed Mad2 knockdown cells sufficient time to build a normal metaphase plate followed by initiation of cytokinesis fully rescuing the mitotic defect caused by Mad2 knockdown . Taken together the data indicate that proTAME is capable of inducing a mitotic arrest with a duration of approximately 2 hours in the absence of Mad2 but sustained mitotic arrest requires the presence of an intact SAC. The data indicate that APC dependent ubiquitination or proteolysis may be required for inactivation of the SAC. This idea is further supported by the finding that mitotic arrest induced by 3 M MG132 is also partially dependent on Mad2 .

The Mad2 dependence of proTAME induced mitotic arrest in HeLa cells suggests that IR tail binding sites may be important for inactivation of the SAC. Recent work suggests that Cdc20 ubiquitination may be important for inducing dissociation of Cdc20 from Mad2. Given that elimination of the IR tail stabilizes Cdc20 in budding yeast it is possible that association of the IR tail with the APC is required to trigger Cdc20 ubiquitination. The IR tail of Cdc20 may be especially critical for the ability of the APC to capture Mad2 Cdc20 complexes ubiquitinate them and induce their dissociation. By blocking IR binding sites on the APC proTAME may prevent APC from capturing Mad2 Cdc20 complexes and thereby inhibit SAC inactivation. In addition APC dependent proteolysis may also contribute to SAC inactivation as it was observed that the mitotic arrest induced by MG132 is also partially Mad2 dependent. Candidate substrates could include Mps1 which is a target of the APC in budding yeast.

proTAME is less effective at inhibiting Cdc20 association with the APC in mammalian cells than in extracts. Although it is possible that the APC Cdc20 dissociation pathway may not be as active in mammalian cells an active SAC in mammalian cells may counter the ability of TAME to induce Cdc20 dissociation. For example SAC complexes such as the MCC may provide an alternative pathway for loading Cdc20 onto the APC that does not require the Cdc20 IR tail. It is also possible that the binding of checkpoint proteins to Cdc20 may shield it from factors that promote Cdc20 dissociation. Because the SAC is not active in egg extract such alternative loading or shielding mechanisms would not be operative explaining why TAME is capable of inducing complete dissociation of Cdc20 from APC in the system but not in mammalian cells.

Microtubule inhibitors are important cancer drugs that induce mitotic arrest by activating the spindle assembly checkpoint SAC which in turn inhibits the ubiquitin ligase activity of the Anaphase Promoting Complex APC . This disclosure is based at least in part upon the discovery of a small molecule Tosyl L Arginine Methyl Ester TAME which binds to the APC and prevents its activation by Cdc20 and Cdh1. The disclosure provides a prodrug of TAME that arrests cells in metaphase without perturbing the spindle. Nonetheless this arrest is dependent on the SAC. Metaphase arrest induced by a proteasome inhibitor is also SAC dependent suggesting that APC dependent proteolysis is required to inactivate the SAC. The mutual antagonism between the APC and the SAC yields a positive feedback loop that amplifies the ability of TAME to induce mitotic arrest.

The Anaphase Promoting Complex APC is required for mitotic exit making the APC a potential new target for antimitotic chemotherapy. TAME is the first small molecule inhibitor of the APC. The methods of the disclosure are used to develop and therapeutic uses for a cell permeable derivative proTAME. Treatment of cells with proTAME causes a surprisingly robust mitotic arrest because APC dependent proteolysis is required for inactivation of the spindle assembly checkpoint SAC . In contrast SAC activating compounds such as microtubule inhibitors do not suppress APC activity as completely. As a result cells rely on continued protein synthesis to maintain mitotic arrest providing an explanation for the known variability in cellular response to microtubule inhibitors. Thus direct APC inhibitors may provide a more uniform and specific method for inducing mitotic arrest.

TAME is a small molecule that inhibits APC activation by preventing Cdc20 binding. A cell permeable prodrug proTAME induces mitotic arrest and cell death. APC dependent proteolysis is required for spindle assembly checkpoint inactivation. ProTAME exploits mutual antagonism between the SAC and APC to block mitotic exit.

How these drugs cause cell death remains unclear but induction of mitotic arrest appears to be a key aspect of the mechanism Bekier M. E. et al. 2009 . Mol Cancer Ther 8 1646 1654 Huang H. C. et al. 2009 . Cancer Cell 16 347 358 . By perturbing the mitotic spindle these drugs activate the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint SAC which delays mitotic exit by inhibiting the ubiquitin ligase activity of the Anaphase Promoting Complex Cyclosome APC . In principle a compound that directly inhibits APC dependent proteolysis should arrest cells in mitosis without causing side effects that result from microtubule inhibition such as peripheral neuropathy.

The APC is the most complex ubiquitin ligase known consisting of more than 11 subunits. The activator proteins Cdh1 and Cdc20 bind to the APC at different cell cycle stages to stimulate APC dependent ubiquitination of substrates and their subsequent destruction by the 26S proteasome Peters J. M. 2006 . Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol 7 644 656 . The activators assist in recruitment of APC substrates and may also stimulate the catalytic activity of the ligase Burton J. L. et al. 2005 .

During G1 Cdh1 binds to the APC to promote degradation of APC substrates to keep mitotic cyclin dependent kinase activity low. The initiation of anaphase and exit from mitosis instead require Cdc20 dependent ubiquitination of APC substrates such as securin and mitotic cyclins Kraft C. et al. 2003 .

Nature 446 876 881 though the mechanism remains incompletely understood Nilsson J. et al. 2008 . Nat Cell Biol 10 1411 1420 .

Because the APC regulates multiple cell cycle events it is not clear whether pharmacological inhibition of its activity will lead to selective or prolonged arrest in mitosis as is the case with microtubule inhibitors. Proteasome inhibitors can block APC dependent proteolysis without perturbing the mitotic spindle Famulski J. K. and Chan G. K. 2007 . Curr Biol 17 2143 2149 but they also inhibit the degradation of many other substrates of the ubiquitin proteasome system and therefore also cause cell cycle arrest during interphase Wojcik C. et al. 1996 . Eur J Cell Biol 70 172 178 . It may be difficult to achieve mitotic arrest by pharmacologic APC inhibition as RNAi approaches indicate that Cdc20 expression must be reduced to a very low level to induce a mitotic arrest Huang H. C. et al. 2009 . Cancer Cell 16 347 358 Wolthuis R. et al. 2008 . Mol Cell 30 290 302 . Even when the SAC is strongly activated by a dose of microtubule inhibitor that completely depolymerizes microtubules a fraction of cells escape mitotic arrest due to residual APC activity Brito D. A. and Rieder C. L. 2006 . Curr Biol 16 1194 1200 suggesting that the SAC cannot fully inhibit the APC during mitosis. For this reason microtubule inhibitors may suffer from limited effectiveness because some cells escape mitotic arrest before dying Bekier M. E. et al. 2009 . Mol Cancer Ther 8 1646 1654 Huang H. C. et al. 2009 . Cancer Cell 16 347 358 . Whether an APC inhibitor can better extinguish APC activity and induce a more persistent mitotic arrest is therefore an important question in contemplating development of APC inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for cancer. Here the first small molecule inhibitor of the APC is described and the compound is used as a tool to reveal reciprocal antagonism between the APC and the SAC. The existence of this regulatory relationship makes direct APC inhibition a particularly effective approach for inducing mitotic arrest.

TAME Inhibits APC Activation by Perturbing Activator Protein Binding. TAME was identified as an inhibitor of cyclin proteolysis in mitotic egg extract ICof 12 M but its mechanism of action has remained unknown. TAME also inhibited cyclin degradation in interphase extract activated by exogenous Cdh1 but had no effect on SCF dependent proteolysis of catenin luciferase Verma R. et al. 2004 . Science 306 117 120 indicating that it is not a general inhibitor of the ubiquitin proteasome system. Testing of TAME derivatives indicated that the tosyl group arginine and the methyl ester are each important for activity . A derivative Acetyl L Arginine Methyl Ester AAME showed only low activity and was therefore used as a negative control in subsequent experiments. When added to interphase extract treated with recombinant cyclin B1 cdc2 complex TAME but not AAME arrested the extract in mitosis with stable cyclin B1 and phosphorylated Cdc27 . Another APC substrate cyclin A was also stabilized by TAME in extract. TAME had no effect on the ability of extract to degrade cyclin B1 that had been preubiquitinated in vitro indicating that TAME does not inhibit the proteasome or its ability to recognize ubiquitinated substrates.

Because the SAC is not active in extracts Minshull J. et al. 1994 . Cell 79 475 486 these findings suggested that TAME might inhibit cyclin proteolysis by directly inhibiting the APC. Indeed when TAME was added to mitotic extract during APC isolation the APC showed a dramatic loss of activity in a reconstituted ubiquitination reaction . These results suggested that adding TAME to extract might alter APC composition inactivating the complex. Consistent with this hypothesis TAME addition to extract reduced Cdc20 association with the APC in a dose dependent manner but did not otherwise affect APC composition . TAME also inhibited the binding of Cdh1 to APC when Cdh1 and TAME were added together to interphase extract . The reduction in Cdh1 binding was accompanied by a reduction in APC activation . These findings suggested that TAME might block APC activation by perturbing the interaction between APC and its activator proteins Cdc20 or Cdh1.

To understand how TAME disrupts the interaction between the activator proteins and the APC it was first determined whether TAME binds to the APC. H TAME was added to interphase extract or to extract immunodepleted of APC and then isolated residual APC with Cdc27 antibodies and measured the amount of radioactivity associated with the beads. Binding of H TAME correlated with the amount of immunoprecipitated Cdc27 . Unlabeled TAME competitively inhibited the binding of H TAME whereas AAME did not . Other TAME derivatives competed with H TAME for APC binding in a manner that correlated with their ability to inhibit cyclin luciferase proteolysis in extract . A similar approach demonstrated that TAME binds to human APC isolated from HeLa cells . Together these findings indicate that the binding of TAME to the APC might explain the ability of TAME to perturb activator protein association.

To understand how TAME disrupts activator binding to the APC it was determined whether TAME could inhibit the interaction of APC with motifs of the activator proteins that have been implicated in APC binding including the C box Schwab M. et al. 2001 . EMBO J 20 5165 5175 and the C terminal isoleucine arginine IR tail Burton J. L. et al. 2005 . Mol Cell 18 533 542 Vodermaier H. C. et al. 2003 . Curr Biol 13 1459 1468 . Because TAME structurally resembles the IR tail of Cdc20 and Cdh1 it was hypothesized that TAME might bind to the APC in the same site normally occupied by the IR tail. Previous work has demonstrated that a C terminal 20 amino acid peptide derived from Cdh1 IR peptide is sufficient to isolate APC from interphase extract Vodermaier H. C. et al. 2003 . Curr Biol 13 1459 1468 . This finding was confirmed and it was further discovered that TAME but not AAME was sufficient to block APC recruitment by the IR peptide . In contrast TAME had no effect on recruitment of APC from mitotic extract by an N terminal fragment of Cdc20 containing only the C box interaction motif indicating that TAME specifically inhibits the IR tail dependent interaction.

The APC subunits Cdc27 and APC7 have been implicated in binding of the IR tail of Cdh1 to the APC Matyskiela M. E. and Morgan D. O. 2009 . Mol Cell 34 68 80 Vodermaier H. C. et al. 2003 . Curr Biol 13 1459 1468 . To determine whether TAME could competitively inhibit the binding of the IR tail to these proteins the IR peptide was conjugated to a photo affinity reagent and performed crosslinking studies with APC immunopurified from interphase extract. Four proteins known to exist in an APC subcomplex namely Cdc27 Cdc16 Cdc23 and Apc7 were crosslinked in an IR dependent manner that could be competed by excess unlabeled IR peptide . At low concentration 20 M TAME efficiently inhibited crosslinking of the IR peptide to Cdc27 and Cdc16 but only slightly reduced crosslinking to Cdc23 and Apc7 . At high concentration 200 M TAME strongly inhibited crosslinking to all APC subunits . Together these findings support the hypothesis that TAME binds to APC subunits that recruit the IR tail thereby preventing activator proteins from associating with the APC.

To confirm that TAME specifically antagonizes IR tail dependent interactions between Cdc20 and the APC the ability of TAME to inhibit the binding of Cdc20 to the APC was tested in a reconstituted system. APC was purified from mitotic extracts and washed with high salt to remove most Cdc20. Purified mitotic APC was then incubated in reticulocyte lysate expressing wild type or mutant Cdc20 and Cdc20 binding to APC was measured by co immunoprecipitation. It was determined that efficient binding of Cdc20 to the APC under these conditions indeed requires the IR tail as a mutant lacking these two residues Cdc20 IR did not bind as efficiently to the APC . TAME also strongly reduced Cdc20 binding to the APC under these conditions . Importantly addition of TAME had no further effect on binding of the Cdc20 IR mutant confirming that TAME does not perturb other interactions between Cdc20 and the APC.

TAME addition or IR tail deletion was not sufficient to fully inhibit Cdc20 association under these conditions. It was hypothesized that other interactions such as C box dependent binding might promote Cdc20 association with the APC thereby masking the effect of TAME addition or IR tail deletion. Consistent with this hypothesis the results indicated that addition of a C box containing N terminal fragment of Cdc20 could competitively inhibit binding of full length Cdc20 to the APC . In the presence of the C box fragment addition of TAME or deletion of the IR tail was sufficient to completely suppress Cdc20 association with the APC. These results indicate that both C box dependent and IR tail dependent interactions are important for Cdc20 binding in these conditions and that TAME specifically disrupts the IR dependent interaction. Thus the target of TAME is the APC and it inhibits APC activation by interfering specifically with IR tail dependent interactions between Cdc20 or Cdh1 and the APC.

A TAME Prodrug Inhibits APC Cdh1 Activation in Cells. Having established the mechanism by which TAME inhibits APC activation in extract it was next determined whether TAME inhibits APC activation in human cells. Because TAME is not cell permeable a TAME prodrug proTAME was synthesized and its control compound proAAME by modifying the guanidino group to produce an N N bis acyloxymethyl carbamate derivative . Such prodrugs can be processed by intracellular esterases to yield the parent compound. In extract proTAME was indeed rapidly converted to TAME which efficiently inhibited cyclin B luciferase proteolysis . ProTAME was also activated efficiently in HeLa cells but not in MCF10A cells .

It was next examined whether proTAME could inhibit association of Cdh1 with the APC in cells. HeLa cells expressing H2B GFP were released from a nocodazole block and 12 M of proTAME were added after cells had entered G1 when the APC is activated by Cdh1. Addition of proTAME inhibited Cdh1 association with the APC but proAAME did not. However proTAME was not sufficient to cause premature accumulation of endogenous APC substrates in G1 or S phase . During S phase when APC substrates are known to be expressed the effect of proTAME may be masked by Emi1 dependent inhibition of APC Cdh1 Hsu J. Y. et al. 2002 . Nat Cell Biol 4 358 366 . To test this idea cells were depleted of Emi1 which leads to degradation of APC substrates and prevents mitotic entry Hsu J. Y. et al. 2002 . Nat Cell Biol 4 358 366 . It was confirmed that Emi1 depletion prevents mitotic entry and found that addition of 12 M proTAME substantially rescued the mitotic entry defect caused by depletion of Emi1 . Therefore proTAME is capable of inhibiting APC Cdh1 function in cells.

Previous studies have shown that knockdown of Cdh1 induces prolonged S phase and mitotic entry delay in human cells Engelbert D. et al. 2008 . Oncogene 27 907 917 Sigl R. et al. 2009 . J Cell Sci 122 4208 4217 . Consistent with these findings proTAME caused a 2 hour delay in mitotic entry when added during release from a double thymidine block . However adding proTAME 6 hour or later after release did not delay mitotic entry suggesting the delay may be a consequence of inhibiting APC Cdh1 in S phase. These findings indicate that although proTAME can inhibit APC Cdh1 activation it has only modest effects on cell cycle progression during interphase.

ProTAME Induces Mitotic Arrest in the Absence of Spindle Damage. To examine effects of proTAME treatment on mitosis HeLa H2B GFP cells were released from a double thymidine block and added proTAME 8 h after release a time at which proTAME addition does not delay mitotic entry . Mitotic duration was then measured by time lapse imaging. Cells treated with low doses of proTAME 780 nM or 3 M remained in metaphase for up to several hours but then proceeded through a normal anaphase whereas cells treated with 12 M proTAME arrested in metaphase and subsequently died . In contrast treatment of cells with 12 M proAAME had no effect. ProTAME greatly increased mitotic duration in asynchronous hTERT RPE1 cells as well as 6 M proTAME increased median mitotic duration to over 8 h compared to 24 min in proAAME treated cells . ProTAME had no effect at similar doses in MCF10a cells because the prodrug was not efficiently activated .

If proTAME blocks mitotic progression by disrupting the APC Cdc20 interaction then reducing Cdc20 expression should enhance the mitotic exit delay induced by proTAME treatment. In control transfected cells 4 M proTAME increased mitotic duration from 1.0 h to 4.8 h . However when Cdc20 levels were reduced by 50 using siRNA mediated knockdown proTAME prolonged mitotic duration to 19.4 h . This effect was synergistic because Cdc20 knockdown by itself only increased mitotic duration to 1.6 hours. These results show that reducing the expression of Cdc20 strongly sensitizes cells to the effect of proTAME consistent with the APC Cdc20 interaction as the relevant target of the compound.

The effect of proTAME treatment on degradation of APC substrates was investigated. Because the SAC does not stabilize all APC substrates during mitosis some substrates such as cyclin A2 Cdc20 and Nek2A are degraded in cells treated with microtubule inhibitors den Elzen N. and Pines J. 2001 . J Cell Biol 153 121 136 Hayes M. J. et al. 2006 . Nat Cell Biol 8 607 614 Nilsson J. et al. 2008 . Nat Cell Biol 10 1411 1420 . In contrast substrates such as cyclin B1 and securin are stabilized by SAC activation. If proTAME directly inhibits APC activation then it would stabilize all APC substrates during mitosis not just those whose stability depends on the SAC. Consistent with this hypothesis cells treated with proTAME accumulated cyclin A2 Cdc20 and Nek2A in addition to cyclin B1 and securin . These results were confirmed in live cell imaging experiments where proTAME stabilized cyclinA2 GFP but the microtubule depolymerizer nocodazole did not . Interestingly proTAME treatment led to greater accumulation of cyclin B1 GFP than nocodazole treatment suggesting that proTAME inhibited APC activation more effectively than a SAC activating compound consistent with the ability of proTAME to directly inhibit APC activation.

The effects of proTAME treatment on mitotic spindle morphology and chromosome congression were assessed and compared to the effects of treatment of cells with microtubule inhibitors. Compared to DMSO treated cells treatment of asynchronous HeLa cells with 12 M proTAME for 2 h yielded no measurable differences in mitotic spindle morphology or inter kinetochore distance which reflects development of proper kinetochore tension . In contrast treatment of cells with nocodazole or taxol for 2 h strongly perturbed spindle organization . In live cell imaging experiments treatment of cells with 3 M proTAME or 10 M MG132 caused no delay in chromosome congression . Treatment of cells with 10 nM nocodazole or 12 M proTAME caused a similar mild congression delay of 6 min but these treatments produced contrasting effects on the metaphase plate. In cells treated with 10 nM nocodazole the metaphase plate appeared loose and was prone to bending whereas in cells treated with 12 M proTAME the metaphase plate appeared tight and did not bend. Importantly 10 nM nocodazole prolonged mitosis by only 20 min data not shown whereas 12 M proTAME induced a mitotic arrest of over 28 h . Thus the mild delay in congression is not sufficient to explain the ability of proTAME to arrest cells in mitosis. ProTAME induces a mitotic arrest by perturbing the APC Cdc20 interaction rather than by stimulating the SAC through interfering with chromosome attachment to the mitotic spindle.

ProTAME induced Mitotic Arrest is SAC Dependent. Because TAME directly inhibits the APC and causes arrest in metaphase with kinetochores that develop tension it was hypothesized that the proTAME induced mitotic arrest in human cells would be independent of the SAC. Therefore unexpectedly it was determined that the SAC is in fact essential for the prolonged mitotic arrest of cells treated with proTAME. In double thymidine synchronized cells Mad2 knockdown greatly shortened the duration of proTAME induced arrest from 24.6 h to 1.4 h . As expected Mad2 knockdown abrogated nocodazole induced arrest shortening the average mitotic duration from 30 h to 0.6 h. The Mad2 dependence of the proTAME induced arrest was confirmed by measurement of APC substrate levels in synchronized cells . These findings indicate that prolonged mitotic arrest induced by proTAME depends strongly on the SAC.

These experiments also revealed the ability of proTAME to delay mitotic exit independent of Mad2 as expected based on TAME s ability to directly inhibit APC activation. In Mad2 knockdown cells proTAME treatment increased median mitotic duration from 12 min to 84 min . Strikingly this mitotic delay was sufficient to give Mad2 knockdown cells enough time to build a normal metaphase plate before initiating anaphase rescuing the chromosome segregation defect caused by Mad2 knockdown . The ability of proTAME to restore normal mitotic division in cells depleted of Mad2 highlights the ability of proTAME to directly inhibit APC activation and further demonstrates that proTAME is unlikely to perturb microtubules or interfere with kinetochore function.

Whereas TAME caused substantial reduction of Cdc20 binding to the APC in extracts proTAME treatment did not cause substantial dissociation of Cdc20 from APC during mitotic arrest in HeLa cells. This might be a consequence of an active SAC pathway that may promote IR tail independent binding of Cdc20 to the APC. Therefore the effect of depleting SAC proteins on the ability of proTAME to disrupt the APC Cdc20 interaction was examined. Indeed when HeLa cells were arrested in mitosis by expression of nondegradable cyclin B proTAME induced significant dissociation of Cdc20 from the APC but only if SAC proteins were depleted by RNAi . These results show that a proTAME induced mitotic arrest occurs without substantial dissociation of Cdc20 from the APC as a consequence of persistent activity of the SAC.

To further understand the SAC dependence of the proTAME arrest SAC signaling was pharmacologically inactivated by treating cells with hesperadin Hauf S. et al. 2003 . J Cell Biol 161 281 294 an inhibitor of Aurora B kinase. This kinase phosphorylates proteins at kinetochores that are not under tension leading to destabilization of microtubule kinetochore interactions and activation of the SAC Biggins S. and Murray A. W. 2001 . Genes Dev 15 3118 3129 Cheeseman I. M. et al. 2006 . Cell 127 983 997 DeLuca J. G. et al. 2006 . Cell 127 969 982 . However recent work using phosphospecific antibodies that recognize Aurora B substrates indicates that kinetochore proteins remain phosphorylated at a basal rate during metaphase Welburn J. P. et al. 2010 . Mol Cell 38 383 392 . It was hypothesized that this basal rate of Aurora B dependent phosphorylation may produce a persistent SAC signal during metaphase that may contribute to the proTAME induced arrest. Three observations supported this hypothesis. First hesperadin treatment dramatically shortened proTAME induced mitotic arrest and led to dissociation of Mad2 and BubR1 from the APC in proTAME arrested cells . As expected hesperadin also substantially shortened taxol induced mitotic arrest with a less pronounced effect on nocodazole induced arrest . Second treatment of proTAME arrested metaphase cells with hesperadin caused deformation of the metaphase plate before cells exited mitosis suggesting that ongoing Aurora B dependent phosphorylation is required to maintain proper kinetochore microtubule attachment in metaphase . Third knockdown of the APC component Cdc27 or the APC specific E2 UbcH10 caused a mitotic delay that could be completely suppressed by hesperadin treatment . Together these experiments support the idea that the SAC remains active in metaphase despite the presence of properly attached chromosomes and that SAC signaling is important for the prolonged mitotic arrest induced by APC inhibition.

One possible explanation for the SAC dependence of the proTAME arrest is that proTAME stabilizes APC substrates such as Nek2A or cyclin A that are normally degraded in early mitosis. For example overexpression of cyclin A has been reported to delay chromosome congression den Elzen N. and Pines J. 2001 . J Cell Biol 153 121 136 . To test whether stabilization of these substrates is important for the proTAME induced arrest HeLa cells were released from double thymidine block into nocodazole for 15 h to allow degradation of cyclin A and other APC substrates that are not efficiently stabilized by the SAC. Cells were then washed out of nocodazole into proTAME. Under this condition proTAME remained capable of inducing a prolonged mitotic arrest that was highly hesperadin sensitive . This result indicates that the SAC dependence of proTAME induced mitotic arrest is unlikely to be caused by stabilization of APC substrates that are normally degraded in a SAC independent fashion.

Metaphase Arrest Induced by a Proteasome Inhibitor is SAC Dependent. Previous work has indicated that APC dependent ubiquitination promotes SAC inactivation in cell lysates Reddy S. K. et al. 2007 . Nature 446 921 925 potentially explaining why the proTAME arrest is SAC dependent. In the cell lysate system APC dependent ubiquitination of Cdc20 but not APC dependent proteolysis was suggested to be important for release of Cdc20 from SAC proteins Reddy S. K. et al. 2007 . Nature 446 921 925 . Proteasome activity may be required for dissociation of the Mad2 Cdc20 complex Visconti R. et al. 2010 . Cell Cycle 9 564 569 . Moreover the data presented herein demonstrate that APC dependent proteolysis could be important for SAC inactivation. A prediction of this model is that mitotic arrest induced by treatment with a proteasome inhibitor should be SAC dependent. To test this idea cells were treated with a low dose of proteasome inhibitor 3 M that was sufficient to arrest cells in mitosis median duration of 15 h . At this concentration the duration of arrest was limited by cell death rather than mitotic exit as only 10 of cells exited mitosis during the 30 h duration of the experiment . In MG132 treated cells depleted of Mad2 by RNAi 50 of the cells exited mitosis indicating that the SAC is required to prevent mitotic exit.

Like proTAME treated cells MG132 treated cells also arrest in metaphase with apparently normal kinetochore attachment Famulski J. K. and Chan G. K. 2007 . Curr Biol 17 2143 2149 . Given that the MG132 induced arrest is Mad2 dependent it was next determined whether the arrest is also hesperadin sensitive. To test this idea ten hours following thymidine release HeLa H2B GFP cells were treated with 3 M MG132 in the presence or absence of hesperadin. Strikingly hesperadin induced rapid mitotic exit in half of the cells with the remainder exiting mitosis more slowly . These distinct behaviors correlated with the timing of drug administration cells that encountered drug while in mitosis exited mitosis quickly whereas cells that encountered drug before mitosis exited slowly . Hesperadin treatment induced dephosphorylation of Cdc27 and reduced levels of Mad2 and BubR1 bound to the APC compared to cells treated with MG132 alone . Co addition of proTAME to MG132 abrogated the ability of hesperadin to drive mitotic exit indicating that mitotic exit under these conditions requires APC dependent ubiquitination. In contrast co addition of taxol to MG132 did not efficiently suppress hesperadin induced mitotic exit underscoring the distinct mechanisms underlying taxol and proTAME induced mitotic arrests. Even when the proteasome was more fully inhibited by increasing the MG132 concentration to 10 M addition of hesperadin caused 40 of cells to exit mitosis implying that sufficient proteasome activity remains in these cells to permit mitotic exit if the SAC is inactivated. Addition of proTAME suppressed the ability of hesperadin to induce mitotic exit indicating that mitotic exit remains dependent on APC dependent ubiquitination. Together these results indicate that the mitotic arrest induced by a proteasome inhibitor is not simply a consequence of direct inhibition of the proteasome but also requires inhibition of APC dependent ubiquitination by the SAC.

The hesperadin sensitivity of the MG132 induced arrest indicated that Aurora B activity is important for maintaining the metaphase plate as shown in proTAME treated cells. Consistent with this idea treatment of MG132 arrested metaphase cells with hesperadin induced deformation of the metaphase plate within 30 min whereas cells arrested with MG132 alone maintained a normal appearing metaphase plate for over 5 h . These results suggest that an Aurora B dependent process is required for maintaining the metaphase plate in MG132 treated cells. Inhibitors of APC dependent proteolysis produce a metaphase arrest that is SAC dependent because Aurora B dependent pathways remain active in metaphase.

Protein Synthesis is Required for Mitotic Arrest Induced by Microtubule Inhibitors but not for APC or Proteasome Inhibitors. The data support a model in which APC dependent proteolysis is required to inactivate the SAC. However this model yields a paradox How could the APC initiate SAC inactivation if it is fully inhibited by the SAC One possibility is that SAC inhibition of APC is never complete with residual APC remaining active to initiate SAC inactivation. Indeed it has been shown that cyclin B1 and securin are slowly degraded even in the presence of a fully active SAC Brito D. A. and Rieder C. L. 2006 . Curr Biol 16 1194 1200 Nilsson J. et al. 2008 . Nat Cell Biol 10 1411 1420 . Prolonged arrest in mitosis might therefore require the continued synthesis of APC substrates during mitosis. Consistent with this model cycloheximide promoted mitotic exit of nocodazole or taxol arrested cells . In striking contrast cycloheximide did not accelerate mitotic exit in proTAME treated cells but rather extended mitotic arrest by delaying cell death . Cycloheximide addition produced similar effects in MG132 treated cells suppressing cell death without promoting mitotic exit . Consistent with these findings labeling experiments demonstrated that known APC substrates such as cyclin B1 and BubR1 are translated during mitotic arrest . Together these findings indicate that ongoing mitotic protein synthesis is essential to maintain a SAC dependent mitotic arrest perhaps by replenishing components that are degraded by residual APC dependent proteolysis.

Studies were carried out to understand why the MG132 induced arrest is resistant to cycloheximide. It was hypothesized that persistent SAC activity cooperates with direct pharmacologic inhibition of the proteasome to slow the rate of APC dependent proteolysis to such a great extent that mitotic arrest no longer depends upon protein synthesis. If this hypothesis is correct then inactivating the SAC should make the MG132 induced arrest sensitive to cycloheximide as protein synthesis would now be required to balance the increased rate of APC dependent degradation. This was indeed the case as depletion of Mad2 or inactivation of the SAC with hesperadin led to mitotic exit in cells treated with cycloheximide and high dose MG132. Addition of proTAME suppressed the effect of hesperadin indicating that mitotic exit remains dependent on APC mediated ubiquitination. Together these results indicate that the ability of proTAME or proteasome inhibitors to induce a prolonged mitotic arrest independent of protein synthesis requires persistent inhibition of the APC by the SAC.

The mechanism of the first small molecule inhibitor of the APC has been identified. TAME binds to the APC and displaces the IR tail of Cdc20 or Cdh1 preventing efficient APC activation. In human cells proTAME treatment causes arrest in metaphase without perturbing the mitotic spindle. Despite development of normal kinetochore tension that should silence the SAC the SAC is required for proTAME to induce mitotic arrest. Similar results were obtained using a proteasome inhibitor. Kinetochore dependent SAC signaling persists at a low rate in metaphase and is inactivated by residual APC dependent proteolysis creating a positive feedback loop between the APC and the SAC . The ability of low doses of proTAME or MG132 to induce metaphase arrest is strongly enhanced by this feedback loop enabling mitotic arrest to be achieved at drug concentrations below those necessary to fully inhibit the APC or the proteasome.

TAME interferes with IR tail dependent APC activation. TAME prevents APC activation by perturbing the binding of the IR tail of Cdc20 and Cdh1 to the APC. The importance of the IR motif in promoting Cdh1 association with yeast and human APC is well established Burton J. L. et al. 2005 . Mol Cell 18 533 542 Kraft C. et al. 2005 . Mol Cell 18 543 553 Matyskiela M. E. and Morgan D. O. 2009 . Mol Cell 34 68 80 Vodermaier H. C. et al. 2003 . Curr Biol 13 1459 1468 . However the role of the Cdc20 IR motif is less clear because the Cdc20 IR tail is not essential in budding yeast Thornton B. R. et al. 2006 . Genes Dev 20 449 460 and a Cdc20 IR mutant can support APC dependent degradation of Nek2A in extract Kimata Y. et al. 2008 . Mol Cell 32 576 583 . The data show that the IR motif of Cdc20 indeed contributes significantly to APC association in vitro as Cdc20 IR binds the APC with lower affinity than the wild type protein and TAME competes with wild type Cdc20 for APC association. Moreover TAME induces significant dissociation of Cdc20 from the APC in extract and proTAME can antagonize Cdc20 binding in human cells if the SAC is inactivated. Functionally TAME stabilizes APC substrates in extract and proTAME inhibits both Cdc20 and Cdh1 dependent degradation in HeLa cells. Taken together these data show that proper engagement of the IR motif of Cdc20 or Cdh1 is critical for APC activation.

TAME Exploits a Positive Feedback Loop between the SAC and the APC. ProTAME induced mitotic arrest requires sustained SAC activity. This finding was unexpected because proTAME treated cells arrest in metaphase with kinetochores that develop normal tension a condition that should inactivate the SAC. In principle the requirement for the SAC in the proTAME arrest could be explained in one of two ways. First proTAME treatment could produce defects in microtubule kinetochore interactions that generate an abnormally high degree of checkpoint signal compared to normal metaphase kinetochores. Alternatively proTAME may hamper SAC inactivation despite normal microtubule kinetochore interactions. The latter model is favored because the degree of checkpoint dependence far exceeds the observed degree of kinetochore microtubule perturbation.

Defects in microtubule kinetochore attachment are either an off target effect of TAME on microtubules or a consequence of specific APC inhibition. Knockdown of Cdc27 or UbcH10 each produced a mitotic exit delay that was SAC dependent. Furthermore treatment of cells with a proteasome inhibitor yielded a SAC dependent mitotic arrest consistent with a recent study showing that MG132 treated mitotic cells show persistent Mad2 Cdc20 interaction Visconti R. et al. 2010 . Cell Cycle 9 564 569 and work in showing that Mad2 and Mad3 remain APC bound in proteasome mutants Ohi M. D. et al. 2007 . Mol Cell 28 871 885 . Together these findings indicate that if defective microtubule kinetochore interactions are indeed present in proTAME treated cells they are likely to result from specific inhibition of APC dependent proteolysis rather than from nonspecific effects of proTAME on microtubules.

If defective microtubule kinetochore interactions exist in proTAME treated cells they must be subtle. Cells treated with 12 M proTAME arrest in mitosis until they die yet form a normal appearing metaphase plate and develop normal kinetochore tension. Furthermore cells treated with 12 M proTAME undergo a normal appearing anaphase when the SAC is inactivated indicating that the mitotic spindle functions properly in the presence of proTAME. The only change in chromosome behavior caused by this dose of proTAME is a slight delay in chromosome congression. A lower dose of proTAME 3 M causes no delay in chromosome congression yet still extends mitotic duration to 5 hours. Although subtle defects in microtubule kinetochore interactions in proTAME treated cells cannot be completely ruled out such defects are not of sufficient magnitude to explain the strong dependence of the proTAME arrest on the SAC.

The alternative explanation for the SAC dependence of the proTAME arrest is that APC dependent ubiquitination or proteolysis is required to inactivate the SAC. Such mutual antagonism between the APC and the SAC is predicted to create a positive feedback loop that would amplify the inhibitory effects of proTAME or a proteasome inhibitor in a SAC dependent manner. This is what occurred. If the SAC is inactivated by Mad2 depletion 12 M proTAME extends mitotic duration by only 72 minutes indicating that this dose only partially inhibits APC activation consistent with the measured ICof 12 M in extract . However when the same dose of proTAME is used in cells with an intact SAC proTAME extends mitotic duration by 23 hours indicating that the effect of proTAME is greatly amplified by the SAC. This degree of amplification cannot be explained by the mild effect of proTAME on chromosome congression because a dose of nocodazole 10 nM that causes a similar delay in chromosome congression extends mitotic duration by only 20 minutes in SAC proficient cells. Because similar results were obtained with a proteasome inhibitor this amplification is best explained by a requirement for APC dependent proteolysis to inactivate the SAC.

APC substrates play an important role in mediating the mutual antagonism between the APC and the SAC. APC dependent ubiquitination of Cdc20 has been proposed to release the APC from the inhibitory effects of the SAC Reddy S. K. et al. 2007 . Nature 446 921 925 Stegmeier F. et al. 2007 . Nature 446 876 881 . However this process does not require proteasome activity in cell lysates Reddy S. K. et al. 2007 . Nature 446 921 925 and others argue that Cdc20 ubiquitination targets Cdc20 for proteasomal degradation in a manner that sustains the SAC Ge S. et al. 2009 . Cell Cycle 8 167 171 Nilsson J. et al. 2008 . Nat Cell Biol 10 1411 1420 . Alternatively many SAC proteins are APC substrates and may need to be degraded to inactivate the SAC. Consistent with this possibility expression of a stable BubR1 mutant induces a mitotic arrest Choi E. et al. 2009 . EMBO J 28 2077 2089 . Another candidate is cyclin B because it is degraded prior to anaphase Clute P. and Pines J. 1999 . Nat Cell Biol 1 82 87 and cyclin dependent kinase activity is required to maintain the SAC Chung E. and Chen R. H. 2003 . Nat Cell Biol 5 748 753 D Angiolella V. et al. 2003 . Genes Dev 17 2520 2525 . Other SAC proteins including Mps1 Bub1 and Aurora B are also APC substrates but their bulk population is not degraded until after anaphase Palframan W. J. et al. 2006 . Science 313 680 684 Qi W. and Yu H. 2007 . J Biol Chem 282 3672 3679 Stewart S. and Fang G. 2005 . Cancer Res 65 8730 8735 . It is possible that degradation of these proteins prior to anaphase is masked by their resynthesis. The mutual antagonism between the APC and the SAC may reflect a system level behavior that is regulated by small changes in the abundance of multiple SAC proteins prior to anaphase. If so confirmation of this model will require quantitative measurements of the relative rates of synthesis and degradation of APC substrates that regulate SAC activity.

Results indicate that it is possible to induce mitotic arrest without fully inhibiting the APC or the proteasome pharmacologically. This result was unexpected because RNAi based experiments indicated that Cdc20 must be reduced to very low levels to induce mitotic arrest Wolthuis R. et al. 2008 . Mol Cell 30 290 302 . Unlike the proTAME induced arrest the mitotic arrest induced by Cdc20 knockdown does not depend on the SAC Huang H. C. et al. 2009 . Cancer Cell 16 347 358 . One possible explanation for the lack of SAC dependence in the context of Cdc20 depletion is that Cdc20 is the target of the SAC Yu H. 2007 . Mol Cell 27 3 16 . Therefore when Cdc20 levels are reduced the SAC is no longer required to inhibit Cdc20 function. In contrast other methods of perturbing APC function including knockdown of core APC subunits or the E2 enzyme UbcH10 or proTAME treatment all produce an arrest that is SAC dependent. This is likely a consequence of the fact that Cdc20 remains present under each of these conditions.

A Model for Regulation of Mitotic Exit. A model is shown in . A positive feedback loop between the SAC and the APC has the potential to adopt one of two stable states high SAC activity mitotic arrest or high APC activity mitotic exit . During normal division it is important that cells do not become permanently arrested in mitosis. The SAC does not fully inhibit the APC during mitosis because residual APC activity must be preserved to prevent cells from becoming locked in mitosis. This residual APC activity may explain why cyclin B1 is degraded prior to the initiation of anaphase Clute P. and Pines J. 1999 . Nat Cell Biol 1 82 87 and during prolonged SAC dependent mitotic arrest Brito D. A. and Rieder C. L. 2006 . Curr Biol 16 1194 1200 Gascoigne K. E. and Taylor S. S. 2008 . Cancer Cell 14 111 122 Huang H. C. et al. 2009 . Cancer Cell 16 347 358 Huang H. C. et al. 2009 . Cancer Cell 16 347 358 Nilsson J. et al. 2008 . Nat Cell Biol 10 1411 1420 . To remain in mitosis for a prolonged period a cell may need to continue to resynthesize APC substrates that are degraded by residual APC dependent proteolysis.

During normal mitosis the development of kinetochore tension reduces the rate of SAC activation but SAC activation is unlikely to be completely suppressed during metaphase. Anaphase is triggered when the rate of SAC activation falls below the rate at which APC dependent proteolysis inactivates the SAC tipping the feedback loop toward rapid APC activation and mitotic exit. The timing of anaphase initiation therefore depends not only on how kinetochore attachment controls SAC activation but also on the level of residual APC activity.

During nocodazole or taxol treatment the rate of SAC activation remains above the rate at which the APC inactivates the SAC tipping the loop in the direction of APC inhibition thereby preventing mitotic exit. Because APC dependent proteolysis is not fully inhibited by the SAC mitotic arrest is dependent on protein synthesis to resupply APC substrates. If the rate of protein synthesis is not sufficient the rate of SAC signal production will fall below the rate at which it is inactivated by the APC leading to rapid APC activation and mitotic slippage. Therefore the rate of protein synthesis in mitosis may be an important determinant of the duration of mitotic arrest in cells treated with microtubule inhibitors.

In contrast to microtubule inhibitors proTAME and MG132 induce mitotic arrest by inhibiting residual APC dependent proteolysis rather than by stimulating SAC activation. The rate of SAC signal production by kinetochores may decline normally in proTAME or MG132 treated cells because kinetochores develop proper tension. However because the rate of residual APC dependent proteolysis is lowered by proTAME or MG132 the rate of SAC signal production cannot fall below the rate at which it is inactivated by APC dependent proteolysis leading to mitotic arrest. The strong hesperadin sensitivity of both proTAME and MG132 induced arrests indicates the importance of metaphase kinetochores in generating a SAC signal to sustain mitotic arrest. Compared to microtubule inhibitors this mechanism of mitotic arrest shows reduced dependence on protein synthesis because the rate of residual APC activity is lower in proTAME and MG132 treated cells yielding a lower requirement for protein synthesis to replenish APC substrates.

Antimitotic Cancer Therapy. The results of the study described here provide an explanation for the variability in cellular responses to microtubule inhibitors that could limit their therapeutic effectiveness. Because the SAC does not completely inhibit the APC mitotic arrest induced by microtubule inhibition depends on protein synthesis. As a result variation in the rates of protein synthesis among cells may be one factor that explains the highly variable response of cells to microtubule inhibitors. In contrast cells treated with an APC inhibitor are less prone to mitotic slippage because residual APC activity is inhibited. APC inhibitors may therefore be more effective in promoting mitotic arrest inducing a greater pro apoptotic effect. Furthermore low doses of an APC inhibitor are useful in combination with microtubule inhibitors to sustain mitotic arrest and enhance cell death.

To determine whether proTAME treatment can enhance mitotic arrest and cell death induced by taxol or a proteasome inhibitor MG132 HeLa H2B GFP cells were co treated with low doses of the microtubule poison Taxol or the proteasome inhibitor MG132 in combination with a low dose of proTAME.

Unsychronized HeLa H2B GFP cells were treated with DMSO control taxol 10 nM or proTAME 3 M or a combination of Taxol 10 nM and proTAME 3 M . The cells were imaged by FITC fluorescence microscopy to monitor the cell cycle and mitotic events. Duration of mitotic events initiated during the first 21 hours of imaging was manually determined for indicated number of cells and the cumulative percentage of cells was plotted as a function of mitotic duration. Individual chemicals induced a mitotic delay with a median of 414 min for Taxol alone and 132 min for proTAME alone as compared to a median mitotic duration of 60 min for control treated cells. The combination resulted in a synergistic increase in mitotic duration to 768 min median mitotic duration. Single treatments resulted in about 10 of cells that remained arrested or died in mitosis throughout the 48 hrs movie while most cells exited mitosis. In contrast 43 cells stayed arrested or died in mitosis in the co treatment therefore indicating synergism in inducing mitotic arrest and mitotic cell death.

To analyze interactions between proTAME and a proteasome inhibitor HeLa H2B GFP cells were synchronized by double thymidine block 2 mM thymidine block for 18 hrs release in medium for 8 hrs 2 mM thymidine block for 18 hrs and treated with the drugs 10 hrs after release from the block as the cells just entered mitosis. In cells treated with a single drug MG132 induced a mitotic delay of 276 min median while proTAME 3 M induced a delay of 438 minutes. The effect of co treatment was synergistic resulting in a median mitotic arrest of more than 1000 min. The synergistic effect in duration of mitotic arrest was also observed with a lower dose of proTAME 1 M where the cells arrested for a median time of 216 min while the combination with MG132 0.5 M resulted in a median arrest of 456 min. The co treatments resulted in an increase in the percentage of cells indefinitely arrested in mitosis or dying in mitosis during the movie as compared to single treatments indicating a benefit in terms of mitotic phenotype of the combination.

These data demonstrate that co treatment of cells with the APC C inhibitor proTAME and drugs that stimulate the spindle assembly checkpoint taxol or inhibit proteasome dependent degradation MG132 results in prolonged mitotic arrest associated with increased mitotic cell death. These co treatments are beneficial in terms of increased mitotic duration and potency to induce cell death in mitosis in development of anticancer co treatment regimens.

Cyclinal was identified in an earlier study as an inhibitor of cyclin proteolysis in mitotic egg extract IC50 of 20 M but its mechanism of action has remained unknown Verma R. et al. Science 306 117 120 2004 . Cyclinal also inhibited cyclin degradation in interphase extract activated by exogenous Cdh1 but had little effect on SCF dependent proteolysis of catenin luciferase indicating that it is not a general inhibitor of the ubiquitin proteasome system Verma R. et al. Science 306 117 120 2004 . Testing of cyclinal derivatives indicated that the pyrimidine moiety but not the nitro imidazole moiety is essential for activity . Cyclinal was also able to stabilize full length recombinant cyclin B1 which was added to interphase extract in the form of Maturation Promoting Factor MPF a complex of cyclin B1 Cdk1 . These data suggest that cyclinal acts as an APC inhibitor. Therefore the effect of cyclinal was tested in an in vitro reconstituted APC ubiquitination assay with a cyclin B1 N terminal fragment CycB NT as the substrate. Consistent with cyclinal being an APC inhibitor cyclinal reduced the ubiquitin conjugates mass on CycB NT under this condition . To gain insight into the inhibitory mechanism the effect of cyclinal treatment on the kand Kof the APC was measured. An assay was performed to measure the initial rate of APC dependent mono ubiquitination on CycB NT that has been previously established to satisfy the assumptions of the Michaelis Menton equation. The results showed that cyclinal causes a significant increase in the Kbut has little effect on the k which is the typical behavior of a competitive inhibitor. Together these results indicate that cyclinal inhibits the APC by competing with substrates for APC binding.

The discovery that cyclinal acts as a competitive APC inhibitor suggests that cyclinal binds to the same site on the APC as the substrate does. Electron microscopy structure of the APC revealed that a co receptor for the D box on APC substrates form between the APC activator and a core subunit Apc10 Buschhorn B. A. et al. Nat Struct Mol Biol 18 6 13 2011 da Fonseca P. C. et al. Nature 470 274 278 2011 . Since the D box is the critical signal for APC driven degradation of cyclin B1 cyclinal may either bind to Cdc20 or the core APC via Apc10. To identify the binding target of cyclinal the amino cyclinal derivative was coupled to Affigel resin and incubated the resin with extracts. The level of Cdc20 and Cdc27 remaining in the extract after cyclinal resin incubation was measured. The results showed that Cdc20 but not Cdc27 was significantly depleted from both interphase and mitotic extracts by cyclinal resin indicating that cyclinal directly binds to Cdc20 instead of the core APC. Because Cdc20 is a sub stoichiometric component of the APC in these extracts even if the APCcomplex may also be pulled down by the resin the change in the total soluble pool of the APC should be insignificant. As expected the mitotic extract depleted of Cdc20 by cyclinal resin was not able to support degradation of the cyclin luciferase reporter which could be rescued by adding in vitro translated Cdc20 confirming that the target of cyclinal is Cdc20.

It was determined whether cyclinal competes with the D box for Cdc20 binding taking advantage of the ability of the cyclinal resin to pull down Cdc20. The pull down of in vitro translated Cdc20 to the resin can be competed by addition of free cyclinal in a dose dependent manner but not by addition of the inactive morpholino derivative . A WT cyclin B N terminal fragment also reduced Cdc20 binding to the cyclinal resin in a dose dependent manner but the same fragment with a mutated or deleted D box had a severely compromised ability to reduce Cdc20 binding to the resin . Moreover a stapled D box peptide is also capable of reducing Cdc20 binding to the cyclinal resin . Taken together these data suggested that cyclinal directly binds to Cdc20 which prevents Cdc20 from interacting with the D box. One possible model is cyclinal and the D box compete for the same binding site on Cdc20 but the data are also consistent with cyclinal binding to an allosteric site on Cdc20 which in turn affects D box binding. A definitive answer to this question relies on structural analysis of the Cdc20 cyclinal or the Cdc20 D box complex.

APC substrates promote Cdc20 binding to the APC even if the IR tail binding site is blocked by TAME presumably because the formation of the co receptor between Cdc20 and Apc10 for the D box in substrates offers one additional contact point between Cdc20 and the APC. Co addition of cyclinal and TAME should inhibit Cdc20 binding the APC even in the presence of substrates because both the Cdc20 APC and the Cdc20 D box interactions will be disrupted. To confirm this hypothesis various combinations of TAME cyclinal and CycB NT were added to mitotic extract and steady state Cdc20 binding to the APC was measured. As expected in the absence of CycB NT TAME caused a strong reduction in Cdc20 level bound to the APC whereas cyclinal only had a modest effect . Addition of CycB NT alone enhanced Cdc20 binding to the APC both in the absence and presence of TAME. Addition of cyclinal with CycB NT largely abrogated CycB NT s ability to enhance Cdc20 binding . Importantly co addition of TAME and cyclinal with CycB NT resulted in strong inhibition of Cdc20 binding similar to what was observed with adding TAME alone . These results demonstrate that cyclinal antagonizes CycB NT s ability to promote Cdc20 binding to the APC providing further evidence that cyclinal is a D box antagonist.

Because cyclinal and TAME synergize to strongly inhibit Cdc20 binding to the APC in the presence of substrates it was determined whether both compounds could also synergize to inhibit the APC. Because both compounds are very effective on their own in stabilizing APC substrates in the extract a condition was used that desensitizes the extract to drug inhibition. Adding high concentrations of the E2 enzymes UbcH10 and UBE2S strongly rescues degradation of the cyclin B1 luciferase reporter in the presence of TAME as a consequence of enhanced processivity during single substrate binding cycle. Adding UbcH10 and UBE2S also promoted degradation of the reporter in cyclinal treated extract . However co addition of TAME and cyclinal significantly stabilized the reporter in the presence of high concentrations of UbcH10 and UBE2S . This result can be explained by the fact that TAME and cyclinal synergize to inhibit Cdc20 binding to the APC so that even a single substrate binding cycle becomes impossible.

Cyclinal overrides mitotic arrest induced by microtubule inhibitors but delays mitotic exit in the absence of the SAC. The effect of cyclinal on tissue culture cells was examined. As opposed to what is expected for an APC inhibitor cyclinal slightly accelerated an otherwise unperturbed mitosis . Interestingly the acceleration effect becomes weaker as the dose of cyclinal increases. Thus cyclinal may have two opposing effects on mitosis one is to delay mitotic exit by stabilizing cyclin B1 as observed in extract and the other one is to accelerate mitosis. As cyclinal concentration increases the mitotic delay effect may start to outcompete the acceleration effect. Consistent with the acceleration effect cyclinal also induced premature exit from mitosis in cells arrested with nocodazole . These results suggest that cyclinal compromises the SAC. However cyclinal treatment has different effects from other methods of inactivation of the SAC. First when the SAC is inactivated by Mad2 knockdown mitotic duration becomes so short that there is not enough time for the cell to congress chromosomes before anaphase onset. Cyclinal treated cells spend significantly longer time in mitosis than Mad2 knockdown and they only initiate anaphase after completion of chromosome congression . Second cells co treated with taxol and cyclinal still display a transient mitotic arrest above 10 h before they exit from mitosis whereas inhibition of Aurora B kinase and kinetochore dependent SAC signaling by hesperadin induces rapid mitotic exit in the presence of taxol 2 h mitotic duration . Taken together these results suggest that cyclinal prevents the SAC from persistently arresting the cell in mitosis but cyclinal unlikely to interfere with the initial establishment of the SAC by kinetochore dependent signaling.

The dominant effect of cyclinal in cells seems to be compromising the SAC which is different from its behavior as an APC inhibitor in extracts that lacks an active SAC pathway. Thus if the SAC is inactivated in cells then the cell system resemble the extract system and the effect of cyclinal as an APC inhibitor may be manifested. Two lines of evidence suggest that this is the case. First when Mad2 knockdown cells were treated with cyclinal a dose dependent delay in mitotic exit was observed . In this case Mad2 knockdown cells are allowed sufficient time to build a normal looking metaphase plate before anaphase onset . Second when cyclinal was added to the lysates from cells arrested in mitosis with nocodazole checkpoint lysate a clear delay in cyclin B1 degradation was observed . The checkpoint lysate does not contain chromosomes and therefore can no longer generate new SAC signal. Together these data demonstrate that the effect of cyclinal as an APC inhibitor can be revealed in cells when active SAC signaling is absent.

The effect of cyclinal on the SAC suggests that a D box Cdc20 interaction is critical for prolonged SAC dependent mitotic arrest but dispensable for a transient mitotic delay. The effector of the SAC is the Mitotic Checkpoint Complex MCC consisting of Mad2 Cdc20 BubR1 and Bub3 Sudakin V. et al. J Cell Biol 154 925 936 2001 . Direct binding between Cdc20 and Mad2 or BubR1 has been observed Fang G. et al. Genes Dev 12 1871 1883 1998 Tang Z. et al. Dev Cell 1 227 237 2001 whereas Bub3 is thought to associate with BubR1 Taylor S. S. et al. J Cell Biol 142 1 11 1998 . Although Mad2 and BubR1 can separately form complexes with Cdc20 and inhibits APCin vitro Fang G. et al. Genes Dev 12 1871 1883 1998 Tang Z. et al. Dev Cell 1 227 237 2001 the SAC requires both proteins to be present for proper function as knockdown of either one results in total inactivation of the SAC Meraldi P. et al. Dev Cell 7 45 60 2004 . Because human Mad2 does not contain a D box and the Mad2 interaction motif on Cdc20 lies out of the WD40 domain the Mad2 Cdc20 interaction is unlikely to be perturbed by cyclinal. However budding yeast Mad3 BubR1 homolog does contain a C terminal D box that has been shown to contribute to Mad3 Cdc20 binding Burton J. L. Solomon M. J. Genes Dev 21 655 667 2007 .

Furthermore mutation of this D box compromises the SAC although the phenotype is not as severe as Mad3 deletion or mutation in the N terminal KEN boxes Burton J. L. Solomon M. J. Genes Dev 21 655 667 2007 . This D box is also conserved in BubR1 of higher organisms but its relevance for the SAC has never been directly evaluated. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts expressing an N terminal fragment of BubR1 containing the KEN boxes in place of endogenous BubR1 supports a transient mitotic delay in the presence of nocodazole but is insufficient for the prolonged mitotic arrest observed in normal cells Malureanu L. A. et al. Dev Cell 16 118 131 2009 suggesting certain elements most likely the D box downstream of the KEN boxes of BubR1 are required for a persistent SAC induced arrest. Because the phenotype of cyclinal treatment is very similar to replacing WT BubR1 with the N terminal fragment it is hypothesized that by selectively perturbing the D box dependent interaction between BubR1 and Cdc20 cyclinal induces a partial compromise of the SAC.

To test this hypothesis the assembly of the MCC was examined in cells treated with cyclinal. Cdc20 was immunoprecipitated from checkpoint lysates prepared from mitotic cells treated with nocodazole or nocodazole plus cyclinal and measured the amount of BubR1 and Mad2 bound to Cdc20. Cyclinal treatment caused a partial reduction in the amount of BubR1 and Mad2 bound to Cdc20 which is consistent with a selective perturbation of the D box but not the KEN box dependent interaction between BubR1 and Cdc20 .

The formation of MCC promotes Cdc20 auto ubiquitination and proteolysis during a SAC induced arrest Reddy S. K. et al. Nature 446 921 925 2007 Nilsson J. et al. Nat Cell Biol 10 1411 1420 2008 Ge S. et al. Cell Cycle 8 167 171 2009 Pan J. Chen R. H. Genes Dev 18 1439 1451 2004 . If cyclinal inhibits the assembly of the MCC Cdc20 auto ubiquitination should be suppressed and its stability should be enhanced in a SAC induced arrest. Synchronized cells were treated with nocodazole cyclinal and collected samples before the cyclinal cells exited mitosis to analyze the level of Cdc20. Whereas Cdc20 was highly unstable in nocodazole treated cells co treatment of cyclinal had a clear effect of enhancing its stability . It has been proposed that one essential function of the SAC is to limit Cdc20 levels via promoting its degradation as cells expressing a non ubiquitinatable Cdc20rapidly exit from mitosis even in the presence of nocodazole Nilsson J. et al. Nat Cell Biol 10 1411 1420 2008 . Therefore stabilization of Cdc20 by cyclinal may be a contributing factor for the compromised SAC response.

In vitro ubiquitination assay. Interphase egg extract was driven into mitosis by a non degradable cyclin B fragment MBP cyclin B 90 added to the extract at 70 g ml . APC was then immunoprecipitated from the extract with Cdc27 antibody Santa Cruz sc 9972 AF3.1 covalently coupled to protein A beads at 4 C. for 1 h Bio Rad 156 0006 . For a single immunoprecipitation IP 2 g antibody was bound to 5 l beads and mixed with 100 l extract. For experiments with endogenous Cdc20 the beads were washed with ubiquitin chain buffer UCB 20 mM Tris 100 mM KCl 2 mM ATP and 2.5 mM MgCl pH 7.7 0.1 IGEPAL CA 630 Sigma I 8896 3 times. The ubiquitination mixture was prepared by adding 250 nM E1 Boston Biochem E 304 2 M UbcH10 150 M ubiquitin Boston Biochem U 100H 500 nM cycB NT and 0.1 IGEPAL CA 630 to the ubiquitin chain buffer 30 min prior to the reaction. The reaction was started by mixing 5 l beads with 10 l of the ubiquitination mixture and left on a shaker at RT for 10 min. The supernatant was then separated from the beads and Cdc20 remaining on the beads or dissociated into the supernatant was analyzed separately by Western blot. Cdc20 antibody was from Santa Cruz sc 53399 BA8 . Ubiquitinated cycB NT was detected with the HA HRP antibody from Roche Applied Science 12013819001 3F 10 . All Western blot images were taken with a Fuji LAS3000 CCD camera based imaging system.

Kinetic analysis of APCreactions. Endogenous APCwas isolated from extract as described above. The ubiquitination mixture was prepared as described in Cdc20 ubiquitination assay with the exception that 60 M methylated ubiquitin was used in place of WT ubiquitin. CycB NT was diluted into the mixture to final concentrations of 1 M 500 nM 250 nM 125 nM and 62.5 nM prior to the reaction. For each reaction 2.5 l beads were mixed with 20 l ubiquitination mixture and left on a shaker at RT for 30 seconds. The reaction was stopped by adding 7 l hot 4 LDS sample buffer Invitrogen NP0007 100 M DTT. Band intensity of the mono di and tri ubiquitinated cycB NT was quantitated with Image J and fitted to a hyperbolic equation by nonlinear regression.

Coupling of amino cyclinal to Affigel 10 resin. Affigel 10 resin Bio Rad was washed twice with DMSO and dried. The resin was then mixed with 5 mM amino cyclinal dissolved in DMSO 2 volume of dry resin . N N Diisopropylethylamine was diluted 50 fold into the solution. The resin was rotated at RT for 2 h and the reaction was quenched with resin volume of ethanolamine. The resin was then washed sequentially with isopropanol water and XB 0.05 tween. The resin was stored at 4 C. as 50 slurry in XB 0.05 Tween.

Cdc20 pull down assay by amino cyclinal resin. For a single pull down assay 5 l amino cyclinal resin was incubated with 30 l diluted in vitro translated Cdc20 5 l reticulocyte lysate diluted to 30 l with XB 0.05 Tween and various competitors at 4 C for 1 h.

Cdc20 depletion and rescue. To deplete Cdc20 mitotic extract was incubated with amino cyclinal affigel resin at a volume ratio of 2 1 and left on a rotator at 4 C. for 45 min and the same process was repeated again. To rescue degradation in the depleted extract reticulocyte lysates containing in vitro translated Cdc20 was added to the extract at 1 10extract volume.

Live cell imaging experiments. Cell synchronization knockdown of Cdc20 or Mad2 by siRNA setup of the live imaging experiments and analysis of the movie were performed as described previously Zeng X. et al. Cancer Cell 18 382 395 2010 . Nocodazole taxol proTAME cyclinal and hesperadin were added to cells at 8 h after release. MG132 was added to cells at 10 h after release to allow mitotic entry. Roscovitine was added to cells at 12 h after release.

Preparation of checkpoint lysate. HeLa cells were synchronized by double thymidine block and treated with 300 nM nocodazle at 8 h after second release from thymidine. Mitotic cells were collected at around 12.5 h after treatment. Cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 C. until the experiment. Cells were lysed in 1 pellet volume of lysis buffer 20 mM Hepes KOH to pH 7.6 5 mM KCl 1 mM DTT 1 protease inhibitor cocktail from 1000 stock leupeptin pepstatin chymostatin all 10 mg ml dissolved in DMSO 20 g ml cytochalasin B 1 energy mix from 20 stock 150 mM creatine phosphate 20 mM ATP 2 mM EGTA 20 mM MgCl 2 mg ml creatine phosphokinase NaOH to pH 7.7 on ice for 15 min and vortexed vigorously every 5 min. The mixture was then centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 30 min and the supernatant was collected as the checkpoint lysate. Protein concentration of the lysate was typically between 15 20 mg ml.

Whereas proTAME induces a persistent mitotic arrest in SAC proficient cells it only transiently delays mitotic exit once the SAC is inactivated suggesting that the major effect of proTAME is prevention of SAC inactivation but its ability to directly inhibit non SAC inhibited APC in the context of the cell is rather weak Zeng X. et al. Cancer Cell 18 382 395 2010 . Because cyclinal and TAME synergize to strongly inhibit APC activation by Cdc20 in extracts it was further determined whether cyclinal and proTAME also synergize in cells. For this experiment Mad2 knockdown cells were treated with proTAME or cyclinal or the combination of the two. Whereas proTAME or cyclinal alone only transiently delayed mitotic exit in Mad2 knockdown cells co addition of both compounds induced a persistent mitotic arrest in these cells . Notably proTAME cyclinal arrested cells were able to build a normal looking metaphase plate suggesting that the combination of the compounds does not perturb microtubule function. The Aurora B inhibitor hesperadin was also used as an alternative method to inactivate the SAC. In this case proTAME only transiently delayed mitotic exit in the presence of hesperadin whereas cyclinal even accelerated a hesperadin treated mitosis . Unlike Mad2 knockdown hesperadin does not accelerate an otherwise unperturbed mitosis which is consistent with the idea that the mitotic timer is set by a kinetochore independent pathway . As observed with Mad2 knockdown cells co addition of cyclinal and proTAME induced a persistent mitotic arrest in cells in the presence of hesperadin . In contrast to Mad2 knockdown cells hesperadin treatment prevented the mitotically arrested cells from maintaining the metaphase plate . Together these data demonstrate that cyclinal and proTAME synergize with each other to induce strong direct inhibition of the APC so that the mitotic arrest is completely independent on the SAC.

Because the mitotic arrest induced by cyclinal proTAME was extremely robust it was determined whether any method can possibly override the effect of both drugs to induce mitotic exit. Direct Cdk1 inhibition has been shown to induce mitotic exit in cells arrested in mitosis with nocodazole D Angiolella et al. Genes Dev 17 2520 2525 2003 . If Cdk1 activity can be fully inhibited then it is no longer necessary for the APC to degrade cyclin B1 which should result in mitotic exit even if the APC remains strongly inhibited by cyclinal proTAME. Therefore cells arrested in mitosis were treated with different methods with a high concentration of a Cdk1 inhibitor roscovitine 100 M . Consistent with earlier reports roscovitine induced instantaneous mitotic exit in cells arrested with nocodazole and taxol data not shown . Roscovitine also induces rapid mitotic exit in the presence of proTAME . Interestingly Cdc20 knockdown cells remained resistant to roscovitine. When treated with roscovitine these cells attempted cytokinesis by elongating the cell body and initiating furrow ingression. However the elongated cell quickly reversed to the original round state and the furrow regressed . The cells then arrested permanently in mitosis . Similarly MG132 or cyclinal proTAME arrested cells showed complete resistance to roscovitine and they also went through the process of cell elongation reversion upon roscovitine treatment. These data demonstrate that roscovitine induced mitotic exit still depends on APC dependent proteolysis. As a result strong inhibition of the proteasome by MG132 or the APC by cyclinal proTAME abrogates the ability of roscovitine to drive mitotic exit.

A 35S labeled cyclin B1 protein was expressed in reticulocyte lysate and a 10 volume of this material was added to mitotically arrested egg extract in the presence of DMSO or different concentrations of inhibitors. Aliquots were taken at 0 and 20 minutes and samples separated by SDS PAGE and radioactivity measured by quantitative phosphorimager analysis. In the presence of DMSO the majority of this substrate is degraded by 20 minutes. Synergy is demonstrated by the fact that the combination of 50 M R7 plus 50 uM TAME has more inhibitory activity than either 100 uM TAME or R7 alone. Similar results were observed at concentrations of 25 uM R7 plus 25 uM TAME which had more activity than 50 uM of each drug on its own. See .

Analysis of the structure activity relationship of apcin revealed that elimination of a single nitrogen in the pyrimidine ring of apcin apcin P reduced activity but replacement with a morpholino group apcin M eliminated activity . Elimination of the nitro imadazole moiety apcin A also reduced activity . To identify the target of apcin apcin A was coupled to beads via its free amino group the beads were incubated with mitotic extract and then the beads were removed. It was determined that Cdc20 but not Cdc27 was substantially depleted from the extracts . A cyclin B luciferase reporter protein was stabilized in the depleted extract and proteolysis could be rescued by adding in vitro translated Cdc20 . Cdc20 expressed in reticulocyte lysate interacted with apcin A beads in a manner that could be competed by free apcin but not by the inactive analog apcin M or the APC C inhibitor TAME . Among a panel of WD40 containing proteins Cdc20 binding to apcin A beads was most robust followed by Cdh1 with much less binding of other WD40 containing proteins observed and . A cyclin B1 N terminal fragment also competed for Cdc20 binding to the apcin A resin but the same fragment with a mutated D box did not . Kinetic analysis of APC C dependent ubiquitination of an N terminal fragment of cyclin B1 using a previously established method Zeng X. King R. W. Nat Chem Biol 8 383 392 2012 showed that apcin caused a significant increase p 0.0039 in the Km Ki 23 M of the reaction but no reduction in kcat and . Together these results suggest that apcin competitively inhibits APC C dependent ubiquitination by binding to Cdc20 and preventing substrate recognition.

To identify the site on Cdc20 that binds apcin apcin was soaked into Cdc20 protein crystals and the structure of the Cdc20 apcin complex was resolved to 2.1 resolution Table 2 . Apcin bound a small pocket on the side of the WD40 domain that has been implicated in binding the D box and . Compared to the apo Cdc20 structure apcin did not cause noticeable changes in Cdc20 conformation. The binding orientation of the small molecule is consistent with the structure activity relationship as the required pyrimidine ring and neighboring aminal nitrogen make potential hydrogen bonds with backbone atoms from D177 the aminal NH of apcin is positioned to act as a hydrogen bond donor with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of D177 and one of the pyrimidine nitrogens of apcin is positioned to serve as a hydrogen bond acceptor with the backbone NH group of D177. The hydrophobic trichloromethyl group is buried in the pocket occupied by leucine of the D box and . The nitro imidazole moiety of apcin which is not required for activity is positioned facing solvent explaining why apcin A retains some activity and can be used to isolate Cdc20 protein when coupled to beads.

It was determined whether mutations in the presumptive binding site affect the binding of Cdc20 to apcin A containing beads . V200 is located at the base of the hydrophobic pocket and mutation to methionine strongly blocked binding of Cdc20 and also inactivated the ability of Cdc20 to rescue cyclin degradation in a Cdc20 depleted extract . D177 and P179 line the binding pocket and make potentially critical interactions with apcin mutation of either residue to alanine also strongly reduced binding to apcin and function of Cdc20 . 1216 also lines the pocket and mutation to serine perturbed binding to apcin . The effect of mutating charged surface residues that are more distant from the apcin binding site was also investigated. E465 makes an ionic interaction with the conserved arginine of the D box. Mutation of this residue decreased the ability of Cdc20 to rescue degradation in a Cdc20 depleted extract but had little effect on apcin binding. E180 lies nearby and may also interact with the D box arginine but mutation to alanine had no effect on apcin binding or rescue activity. Finally R174 lies near the pyrimidine ring of apcin and mutation to serine strongly reduced apcin binding and blocked Cdc20 rescue activity consistent with a potential role of this residue in interacting with negatively charged amino acids in the D box and . Although the guanidino group of R174 does not interact with apcin its aliphatic segment packs against V176 which lines the binding pocket. Overall a strong correlation was observed between effects on apcin binding and Cdc20 function particularly for residues that line the apcin binding pocket.

Because apcin occupies the leucine binding pocket of Cdc20 but appears not to obscure other D box interacting residues it provides a useful tool for assessing the role of the leucine pocket in stabilizing ternary interactions between APC C Cdc20 and substrate. Structural and biochemical studies suggest that Cdc20 is recruited to the APC C through multiple weak interactions. These include the C terminal isoleucine arginine IR tail of Cdc20 which interacts with Cdc27 and the C box which is thought to interact with APC2. Additionally substrates can promote cooperative Cdc20 binding to the APC C through a co receptor interaction in which the substrate is simultaneously recognized by Cdc20 and the APC C. To assess the importance of the leucine pocket in co receptor dependent binding it was determined whether apcin could block substrate induced binding of Cdc20 to the APC C in extract. Substrate increased Cdc20 loading onto APC C in a concentration and D box dependent manner and and that this loading could be blocked by addition of apcin indicating that the leucine pocket is critical for co receptor mediated Cdc20 binding to APC C. The small molecule TAME which antagonizes the IR tail interaction between Cdc20 and the APC C also antagonized Cdc20 loading. Interestingly at high concentrations of substrate the combined use of apcin and TAME was more effective at blocking Cdc20 binding to APC C than either compound used alone suggesting that simultaneous disruption of multiple interactions between substrate Cdc20 and the APC C may be an effective strategy for inhibiting APC C function.

Because substrates can be recruited to the APC C through both D box dependent and D box independent mechanisms the ability of apcin to stabilize different APC C substrates in mitotic extract was compared. Apcin stabilized an N terminal fragment of cyclin B1 and securin most effectively and with somewhat weaker effects against full length cyclin B1 . Interestingly even high concentrations of apcin failed to stabilize cyclin A2 or Nek2A and . In contrast TAME inhibited the degradation of all APC C substrates and consistent with TAME s ability to directly block recruitment of Cdc20 to the APC C. These results indicate that the leucine pocket of Cdc20 plays an essential role in recruiting the D boxes of securin and the N terminal fragment of cyclin B1 and that apcin can effectively compete with these interactions. The ability of full length cyclin B1 to bind Cks1 via Cdk1 may facilitate its recruitment to the APC C independent of the D box helping the substrate to partially overcome the effects of apcin. A similar phenomenon may explain the insensitivity of cyclin A2 proteolysis to apcin. Furthermore the N terminal region of cyclin A2 appears to bind Cdc20 with higher affinity than cyclin B125 which may further reduce the effectiveness of apcin. In contrast to all of these substrates whose degradation is D box dependent Nek2A is thought to be recruited directly to the APC C via a Cdc20 independent mechanism that requires its MR tail rather than a canonical D box explaining why apcin fails to stabilize the protein and . The sensitivity of APC C substrates to apcin parallels their sensitivity to APC C inhibition by the spindle assembly checkpoint SAC as cyclin A2 and Nek2A are also unique in their ability to evade stabilization by the SAC.

Because apcin and TAME inhibit APC C dependent proteolysis by distinct mechanisms and the combined compounds showed a greater effect in blocking substrate dependent binding of Cdc20 to the APC C the effect of combining the inhibitors on the proteolysis of APC C substrates in extracts was determined. Combining the compounds led to synergistic stabilization of full length cyclin B1 the N terminal cyclin B1 fragment securin and cyclin A2 with a much weaker effect for Nek2A and . For example combining TAME and apcin at 25 M each was more effective at stabilizing cyclin B1 than using either compound alone at 100 M. Apcin was able to strongly potentiate the effect of TAME in stabilizing cyclin A2 despite having no effect by itself. This finding indicates that engagement of the D box binding site by cyclin A2 may be particularly important when other interactions in the substrate Cdc20 APC C complex are weakened. Apcin slightly enhanced the ability of TAME to stabilize Nek2A indicating that the leucine pocket on Cdc20 may bind Nek2A even though this interaction is not essential for proteolysis if the APC C is not otherwise perturbed.

To determine whether this synergistic inhibition of APC C dependent proteolysis would translate into a similar effect on mitotic exit in mammalian cells the effect of apcin proTAME a cell permeable TAME prodrug and the combination on mitotic duration in different human cell lines was determined. In order to quantitatively assess interactions between the inhibitors a high throughput image based assay was used to determine the mitotic index . As determined by comparison to a Bliss independence model apcin and proTAME showed a strongly synergistic ability to increase the mitotic fraction in all cell lines examined and . Apcin M was inactive in this assay whereas apcin P retained activity consistent with effects on Cdc20 binding and APC C substrate stability in extract.

To confirm these results the effect of these inhibitors on mitotic duration was evaluated by live cell imaging in RPE1 cells Tables 3 6 . On its own 25 M apcin showed a non significant trend to decrease the rate of mitotic exit to 88.8 of that in control DMSO treated cells p 0.279 Cox proportional hazards model but apcin M did not p 0.201 . The ability of apcin to slow mitotic exit was much more apparent p 0.0001 when mitotic duration was shortened by inactivation of the SAC by depletion of Mad2 by RNAi. These data indicate that apcin slows mitotic exit.

In contrast in the presence of proTAME the addition of apcin dramatically slowed the rate of mitotic exit in a synergistic manner Tables 3 6 the rate of mitotic exit was 63 of that predicted by a multiplicative combination of the single compound effects p 0.016 Cox proportional hazards model . Significant synergy was also observed in U2OS cells p 2.0 10 and Tables 7 9 . Addition of the inactive derivative apcin M had no effect on the rate of mitotic exit in the presence of proTAME p 0.68 . The effect of proTAME alone was biphasic because prolongation of metaphase can cause cohesion fatigue in a subpopulation of cells which can in turn reactivate the SAC to block mitotic exit. Notably in addition to prolonging mitotic duration the addition of apcin eliminated the biphasic response. Furthermore the combined effect of apcin and proTAME was largely preserved even when the SAC was inactivated by Mad2 depletion. When modeled quantitatively the degree of synergy between apcin and proTAME was enhanced in the absence of Mad2 as the rate of mitotic exit was reduced to 38 of the rate predicted by a multiplicative combination of the single compound effects p 8.92 10 Tables 4 6 . The increase in synergy arose because inactivating the SAC had a proportionately greater effect on proTAME treatment alone compared to the combined effect of apcin and proTAME. Together these findings suggest that the synergistic effect on mitotic exit does not rely on the SAC but instead likely reflects direct APC C inhibition.

Apcin preferentially stabilizes APC C substrates whose degradation is D box dependent. However on its own apcin does not effectively block mitotic exit either because substrates can outcompete apcin binding to the leucine pocket or because substrates can be recruited to the APC C through other mechanisms. The effectiveness of apcin can be dramatically enhanced by the addition of TAME which blocks Cdc20 loading through a distinct mechanism highlighting the importance of multiple weak protein protein interactions in promoting activator binding and efficient substrate ubiquitination . Interestingly these weak interactions are mediated by binding of Cdc20 to three distinct subunits of the APC C perhaps explaining why APC C composition is so complex. In addition to identifying a new druggable site on Cdc20 this work highlights the possibility of disrupting the function of a protein machine by simultaneously inhibiting multiple protein protein interactions. Because dynamic protein complexes regulate virtually all aspects of cell biology simultaneous targeting of multiple weak interactions may represent a new opportunity for therapeutic targeting of protein complexes that may otherwise be difficult to inhibit with a single compound.
