This application is a continuation application of U.S. Non Provisional application Ser. No. 14 075 444 filed on Nov. 8 2013 which claims priority from U.S. Pat. No. 8 580 874 filed on Oct. 19 2009 371 date Jan. 11 2010 which claims priority from International Application Serial No. PCT US08 05123 filed on Apr. 18 2008 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60 925 463 filed Apr. 20 2007 which are incorporated herein by reference.

One or more embodiments of this invention relate to the use of diene end capped polymers in the production of modified asphalt compositions.

Asphalt paving compositions which include a mixture of asphalt binder and aggregate have long been employed in the manufacture of pavements. The asphalt binder compositions often included polymeric additives and are therefore often referred to as modified or polymer modified asphalt binder compositions. The presence of polymeric materials is believed to improve the behavior of the pavements particularly at extreme temperatures.

While elastomeric polymers having low crystallinity are often advantageously employed the presence of high Tg polymers also produces benefit. Therefore particularly useful polymers include block copolymers including low Tg amorphous segments or blocks and high Tg amorphous segments or blocks. For example block copolymers including a block of styrene and a block of butadiene may be used including polymers such as block styrene butadiene styrene SBS .

In manufacturing the modified asphalt binder compositions polymer is introduced with molten asphalt. Under sufficient conditions of mixing and or shear the polymer is dissolved and or dispersed into the molten asphalt composition. It is desirable to uniformly disperse the polymer throughout the composition.

It has been discovered that certain polymers such as styrene butadiene styrene block polymers do not disperse as efficiently into the molten asphalt. This is especially true with high molecular weight polymers. As a result greater energy requirements and time are required to achieve a desirable dispersion of the polymer within the asphalt.

Conventional approaches to improving the dispersibility of the polymers into the molten asphalt includes the use of lower molecular weight polymers which generally disperse more readily into the asphalt composition. Unfortunately by using lower molecular weight polymers the advantages sought by the use of a higher molecular weight polymers cannot be fully achieved. For example certain binder and or pavement performance ratings cannot be achieved with low molecular weight polymers.

Thus there is a need to improve the dispersibility of polymers particularly polymers including high Tg blocks without deleteriously sacrificing performance attributes that are advantageously achieved with higher molecular weight polymers.

In one or more embodiments the block copolymers employed in the present invention can be synthesized by employing anionic polymerization techniques. In one or more embodiments living polymers include anionically polymerized polymers i.e. polymers prepared by anionic polymerization techniques . Anionically polymerized living polymers may be formed by reacting anionic initiators with certain unsaturated monomers to propagate a polymeric structure. Or in other embodiments other monomers such as epoxides or cyclic siloxanes may be polymerized by anionic polymerization. Throughout formation and propagation of the polymer the polymeric structure may be anionic and living. A new batch of monomer subsequently added to the reaction can add to the living ends of the existing chains and increase the degree of polymerization. A living polymer therefore includes a polymeric segment having a living or reactive end. Anionic polymerization is further described in George Odian ch. 5 3Ed. 1991 or Panek 94 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 8768 1972 which are incorporated herein by reference.

Monomers that can be employed in preparing an anionically polymerized living polymer include any monomer capable of being polymerized according to anionic polymerization techniques. These monomers include those that lead to the formation of elastomeric homopolymers or copolymers. Suitable monomers include without limitation conjugated C Cdienes C Cmonovinyl aromatic monomers and C Ctrienes. Examples of conjugated diene monomers include without limitation 1 3 butadiene isoprene 1 3 pentadiene 2 3 dimethyl 1 3 butadiene and 1 3 hexadiene. A non limiting example of trienes includes myrcene. Aromatic vinyl monomers include without limitation styrene methyl styrene p methylstyrene and vinylnaphthalene. When preparing elastomeric copolymers such as those containing conjugated diene monomers and aromatic vinyl monomers the conjugated diene monomers and aromatic vinyl monomers are normally used at a ratio of 95 5 to 50 50 and preferably 95 5 to 65 35.

Any anionic initiator can be employed to initiate the formation and propagation of the living polymers. Exemplary anionic initiators include but are not limited to alkyl lithium initiators such as n butyl lithium arenyllithium initiators arenylsodium initiators aminoalkyllithiums and alkyl tin lithiums. Other useful initiators include N lithiohexamethyleneimide N lithiopyrrolidinide and N lithiododecamethyleneimide as well as organolithium compounds such as the tri alkyl lithium adducts of substituted aldimines and substituted ketimines and N lithio salts of substituted secondary amines. Still others include alkylthioacetals e.g. dithianes . Exemplary initiators are also described in the following U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 332 810 5 329 005 5 578 542 5 393 721 5 698 646 5 491 230 5 521 309 5 496 940 5 574 109 5 786 441 and International Publication Nos. WO 2004 020475 and WO 2004 041870 which are incorporated herein by reference.

The amount of initiator employed in conducting anionic polymerizations can vary widely based upon the desired polymer characteristics. In one or more embodiments from about 0.1 to about 100 and optionally from about 0.33 to about 10 mmol of lithium per 100 g of monomer is employed.

Anionic polymerizations are typically conducted in a polar solvent such as tetrahydrofuran THF or a non polar hydrocarbon such as the various cyclic and acyclic hexanes heptanes octanes pentanes their alkylated derivatives and mixtures thereof as well as benzene.

In order to promote randomization in copolymerization and to control vinyl content a polar coordinator may be added to the polymerization ingredients. Amounts range between 0 and 90 or more equivalents per equivalent of lithium. The amount depends on the amount of vinyl desired the level of styrene employed and the temperature of the polymerization as well as the nature of the specific polar coordinator modifier employed. Suitable polymerization modifiers include for example ethers or amines to provide the desired microstructure and randomization of the comonomer units.

Compounds useful as polar coordinators include those having an oxygen or nitrogen heteroatom and a non bonded pair of electrons. Examples include dialkyl ethers of mono and oligo alkylene glycols crown ethers tertiary amines such as tetramethylethylene diamine TMEDA linear THF oligomers and the like. Specific examples of compounds useful as polar coordinators include tetrahydrofuran THF linear and cyclic oligomeric oxolanyl alkanes such as 2 2 bis 2 tetrahydrofuryl propane di piperidyl ethane dipiperidyl methane hexamethylphosphoramide N N dimethylpiperazine diazabicyclooctane dimethyl ether diethyl ether tributylamine and the like. The linear and cyclic oligomeric oxolanyl alkane modifiers are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 429 091 incorporated herein by reference.

Anionically polymerized living polymers can be prepared by either batch or continuous methods. A batch polymerization is begun by charging a blend of monomer s and normal alkane solvent to a suitable reaction vessel followed by the addition of the polar coordinator if employed and an initiator compound. The reactants are heated to a temperature of from about 20 to about 130 C. and the polymerization is allowed to proceed for from about 0.1 to about 24 hours. This reaction produces a reactive polymer having a reactive or living end. Preferably at least about 30 of the polymer molecules contain a living end. More preferably at least about 50 of the polymer molecules contain a living end. Even more preferably at least about 80 contain a living end.

After formation of the functional polymer a processing aid and other optional additives such as oil can be added to the polymer cement. The functional polymer and other optional ingredients may then be isolated from the solvent and optionally dried. Conventional procedures for desolventization and drying may be employed. In one embodiment the functional polymer may be isolated from the solvent by steam desolventization or hot water coagulation of the solvent followed by filtration. Residual solvent may be removed by using conventional drying techniques such as oven drying or direct drying. Alternatively the cement may be directly dried.

As is known in the art of anionic polymerization block copolymers can be synthesized by sequentially polymerizing distinct monomer. For example conjugated diene monomer can first be polymerized to form the d block and then vinyl aromatic monomer can be added to the solution containing the live polymer to thereby form the V block and then additional conjugated diene monomer can be added to the solution containing the live polymer to form the D block. This living polymer which can be represented by d V D where d V and D are defined above can then be coupled with a coupling agent. The residue of this coupling agent forms the moiety.

Useful coupling agents include those compounds that can react with and serve to couple two or more living polymers together. In one or more embodiments useful coupling agents include monoesters. Useful monoesters include those defined by the formula

In one or more embodiments mono valent organic groups may include hydrocarbyl groups such as but not limited to alkyl cycloalkyl substituted cycloalkyl alkenyl cycloalkenyl substituted cycloalkenyl aryl substituted aryl aralkyl alkaryl allyl and alkynyl groups. These hydrocarbyl groups may contain heteroatoms such as but not limited to nitrogen oxygen boron silicon sulfur tin and phosphorus atoms. In one or more embodiments an ester group or a group that includes an ester linkage is included in one or more of the mono valent organic groups. As those skilled in the art appreciate where the mono valent organic group includes one or more ester linkages the ester molecule may be a diester triester or other multi ester.

Particular examples of monoesters include butyl benzoate. Particular examples of diesters include dioctyl terphthalate. Particular examples of triesters include trioctyl trimellitate.

Useful coupling agents include monoesters such as butyl benzoate diesters such as dioctyl terephthalate or triesters such as trioctyl trimellitate. As is known in the art the functionality of the coupling agent will dictate whether the block copolymer is a linear or star branched molecule.

In one or more embodiments the coupling agent may include metal halides or metalloid halides such as those that may be selected from the group consisting of compounds expressed by the formula 1 RMX the general formula 2 MX and the general formula 3 MX where Rin the general formula 1 is the same or different and represents a mono valent organic group with carbon number of 1 to about 20 Min the general formulas 1 and 2 represents a tin atom silicon atom or germanium atom Min the general formula 3 represents a phosphorous atom X in the general formulas 1 3 represents a halogen atom and n in the general formula 1 represents an integer of from 0 to about 3.

Phosphorous trichloride phosphorous tribromide and the like can be exemplified as the compounds expressed by the general formula 3 . In one or more embodiments mixtures of metal halides and or metalloid halides can be used.

In one or more embodiments a derives from the oligomerization of divinylbenzene with living polymer chains. According to theoretical calculations this synthesis will yield a star polymer including 9 branches or arms. As a result the macromolecular structure of the block copolymer is a star branched polymer with 9 arms or branches.

In one or more embodiments only portion of the d V D living polymers are coupled. After a partial coupling the solution of living polymer and coupling polymer can be quenched and isolation of the polymeric species results in a polymer mixture including coupled polymer and uncoupled d V D polymer. This mixture can then be introduced with the molten asphalt to form the modified asphalt compositions employed in the present invention.

In one or more embodiments particularly where the coupling of the d V D living polymers results in a linear di coupled block copolymer the living polymer solution may be coupled from about 10 to about 70 in other embodiments from about 20 to about 40 and in other embodiments from about 25 to about 35 .

In one or more embodiments the living polymer solution may be coupled to at least 50 in other embodiments at least 60 in other embodiments at least 70 in other embodiments at least 80 in other embodiments at least 90 and in other embodiments at least 95 .

In one or more embodiments the block copolymers of the present invention can advantageously be prepared in an organic solvent. Suitable solvents include those organic compounds that will not undergo polymerization or incorporation into propagating polymer chains. In one or more embodiments these organic species are liquid at ambient temperature and pressure. Exemplary organic solvents include hydrocarbons with a low or relatively low boiling point such as aromatic hydrocarbons aliphatic hydrocarbons and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons. Non limiting examples of aromatic hydrocarbons include benzene toluene xylenes ethylbenzene diethylbenzene and mesitylene.

One or more embodiments of the present invention provide a method for forming a modified asphalt binder composition that is useful for preparing asphalt paving compositions. In one or more embodiments the modified asphalt binder composition may be formed by introducing and mixing an asphalt binder and a polymer. The modified asphalt binder composition may be combined with aggregate to form an asphalt paving composition. In particular embodiments the asphalt paving composition can be formed into pavements.

One or more embodiments the asphalt binder compositions of the present invention are prepared by adding phosphorus pentasulfide to the asphalt compositions in a manner consistent with co pending U.S. Ser. No. 11 644 557 which is incorporated herein by reference.

The term asphalt binder is used as understood by those skilled in the art and is consistent with the meaning provided by AASHTO M320. Where asphalt binder has been combined with aggregate the term asphalt paving composition is employed. As used within this specification the terms asphalt and asphalt binder may be used synonymously. The asphalt binder material may be derived from any asphalt source such as natural asphalt rock asphalt produced from tar sands or petroleum asphalt obtained in the process of refining petroleum. The asphalt binder may be selected from those currently graded by AASHTO M320 and ASTM D 6373 including Performance Graded Asphalt Binders. In other embodiments asphalt binders may include a blend of various asphalts not meeting any specific grade definition. This includes air blown asphalt vacuum distilled asphalt steam distilled asphalt cutback asphalt or roofing asphalt. Alternatively gilsonite natural or synthetic used alone or mixed with petroleum asphalt may be selected. Synthetic asphalt mixtures suitable for use in the present invention are described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4 437 896. In one or more embodiments asphalt includes petroleum derived asphalt and asphaltic residual. These compositions may include asphaltenes resins cyclics and saturates. The percentage of these constituents in the overall asphalt binder composition may vary based on the source of the asphalt.

Asphaltenes include black amorphous solids containing in addition to carbon and hydrogen some nitrogen sulfur and oxygen. Trace elements such as nickel and vanadium may also be present. Asphaltenes are generally considered as highly polar aromatic materials of a number average molecular weight of about 2000 to about 5000 g mol and may constitute about 5 to about 25 of the weight of asphalt.

Resins polar aromatics include dark colored solid and semi solid very adhesive fractions of relatively high molecular weight present in the maltenes. They may include the dispersing agents of peptizers for the asphaltenes and the proportion of resins to asphaltenes governs to a degree the sol or gel type character of asphalts. Resins separated from bitumens may have a number average molecular weight of about 0.8 to about 2 kg mol but there is a wide molecular distribution. This component may constitute about 15 to about 25 of the weight of asphalts.

Cyclics naphthene aromatics include the compounds of lowest molecular weight in bitumens and represent the major portion of the dispersion medium for the peptized asphaltenes. They may constitute about 45 to about 60 by weight of the total asphalt binder and may be dark viscous liquids. They may include compounds with aromatic and naphthenic aromatic nuclei with side chain constituents and may have molecular weights of 0.5 to about 9 kg mol.

Saturates include predominantly the straight and branched chain aliphatic hydrocarbons present in bitumens together with alkyl naphthenes and some alkyl aromatics. The average molecular weight range may be approximately similar to that of the cyclics and the components may include the waxy and non waxy saturates. This fraction may from about 5 to about 20 of the weight of asphalts.

In these or other embodiments asphalt binders may include bitumens that occur in nature or may be obtained in petroleum processing. Asphalts may contain very high molecular weight hydrocarbons called asphaltenes which may be soluble in carbon disulfide pyridine aromatic hydrocarbons chlorinated hydrocarbons and THF. Asphalts or bituminous materials may be solids semi solids or liquids.

In one or more embodiments the asphalt binders prior to modification i.e. prior to combination with unsaturated polymer or PS may be characterized by a PG rating of at least PG 64 22 in other embodiments at least PG 52 28 and in other embodiments at least PG 52 34. It should be noted that each of these exemplary asphalt binders have a temperature performance range of 86 C. While the selection of these asphalt binders may be advantageous desirable and certain embodiments practice of the present invention advantageously allows for the use of a base asphalt binder with a lower temperature range because this lower temperature range can be upgraded through practice of the present invention. For example a PG 64 16 PG 58 22 or PG 52 28 can be modified to increase its temperature range. As those skilled in the art appreciate PG rating refers to Super Pave Superior Performing Pavements Performance Graded PG binder specifications as developed in the United States through research funded by the Association of American Highway and Transportation Officials AASHTO M320 .

The modified asphalt binder compositions of this invention may also include those other ingredients or constituents that are commonly employed in the industry. For example the compositions may include anti stripping compounds.

In other embodiments curing agents can optionally be added to the modified asphalt binder compositions of this embodiment. Curing agents may include phenolic resins and elemental sulfur. One example is a bismaleimide curing agent. Conventional amounts may be employed in practicing this invention. In one or more embodiments the need for a curing agent particularly sulfur is eliminated. In other words asphalt binder compositions of the present invention can be prepared without the addition of a curing agent and or a sulfur containing curative other than the phosphorus pentasulfide.

The asphalt binder compositions of the present invention may include from about 0.1 to about 10 parts by weight in other embodiments from about 0.2 to about 6 parts by weight and in other embodiments from about 0.5 to about 4 parts by weight polymer per 100 parts by weight asphalt binder. In these or other embodiments the asphalt binder compositions of the present invention may include less than 5 parts by weight in other embodiments less than 4 parts by weight in other embodiments less than 3 parts by weight in other embodiments less than 2.5 parts by weight in other embodiments less than 2 parts by weight in other embodiments less than 1.8 parts by weight in other embodiments less than 1.5 parts by weight polymer per 100 parts by weight asphalt binder.

In those embodiments where a curative is employed the asphalt compositions of this invention may include from about 0.1 to about 10 in other embodiments from about 0.2 to about 6 and in other embodiments from about 0.5 to about 4 parts by weight curative per 100 parts by weight asphalt. In these or other embodiments the formation of the asphalt binder compositions of the present invention may employ less than 3 parts in other embodiments less than 1 parts in other embodiments less than 0.5 parts in other embodiments less than 0.25 parts in other embodiments less than 0.1 parts and in other embodiments less than 0.01 parts by weight curative e.g. free sulfur or elemental sulfur per 100 parts by weight asphalt binder.

In one or more embodiments the modified asphalt binder compositions of this invention can be prepared by introducing asphalt binder with a desired amount of polymer e.g. unsaturated polymer at a desired temperature. In one embodiment the polymer may be added to molten asphalt binder at temperatures greater than about 120 C. or in other embodiments from about 140 C. to about 210 C. In one or more embodiments the polymer and asphalt may be mixed or blended after or during introduction of the same. Mixing may then be continued for about 25 to about 400 minutes at a temperature of about 145 C. to about 205 C. or in other embodiments from about 160 C. to about 193 C. . In one or more embodiments the mixture of the asphalt binder and polymer may be sheared in order to disperse the polymer quickly into the asphalt. Shearing may be accomplished for example within a high shear mill such as that produced by Siefer. In other embodiments simple low shear mixing may be employed where time is less important.

The modified asphalt binder compositions prepared according to the present invention may be employed to prepare asphalt paving compositions. These paving compositions may include the modified asphalt binder aggregate and other optional constituents that can be added into paving compositions as is known in the art. Conventional aggregate that is used in the paving industry can be utilized in the practice of this embodiment. Aggregate may include rocks stones slags crushed stone gravel sand silica or mixtures of one more thereof. Specific examples of aggregates include marble limestone basalt dolomite sandstone granite quartzite steel slag and mixture of two or more thereof.

Aggregate typically has a wide distribution of particle sizes ranging from sub micron particles e.g. dust to golf ball sized masses as large as 63 mm in diameter. The best particle size distribution varies from application to application.

In addition to the aggregate and the modified asphalt binder the paving compositions of the present invention may also include other constituents or ingredients that may be used in preparing asphalt paving compositions. These additional constituents or ingredients may include fibers release agents and fillers. Other examples include calcium hydroxide sanders dust cellulose fibers propylene based fibers and mixtures of two or more thereof.

The asphalt paving compositions of the present invention can be prepared by using standard equipment and procedures. In one or more embodiments the aggregate is mixed with the modified asphalt binder to attain an essentially homogeneous asphalt paving. For instance the aggregate can be mixed with the modified asphalt binder to produce asphalt paving composition on a continuous basis in a standard mixer.

When preparing an asphalt paving composition generally from about 1 weight percent to about 10 weight percent of the modified asphalt and from about 90 weight percent to about 99 weight percent aggregate based on the total weight of the asphalt paving composition is mixed. In other embodiments the paving compositions include from about 2 to about 8 weight percent of the modified asphalt.

The asphalt paving compositions prepared according to the present invention are particularly advantageous for preparing pavements. As is known in the art the pavement can be prepared by depositing the asphalt paving composing onto a surface. These pavements may include but are not limited to roadways airport runways walkways trails golf cart paths pond liner landfill covers and bridge decks. Also the modified asphalt binder compositions of the present invention are advantageous for making other compositions besides the pavement compositions. For example the modified asphalt compositions may be useful in roofing applications.

In order to demonstrate the practice of the present invention the following examples have been prepared and tested. The examples should not however be viewed as limiting the scope of the invention. The claims will serve to define the invention.

Two polymers in accordance with the present invention we prepared and dissolved in asphalt according to a standardized test procedure. Two comparative polymers that were commercially obtained were likewise dissolved. The ease of dissolvability in the asphalt was recorded.

The characteristics of the polymers used are provided in Table I together with the results of the test. Comparative I was a radial polymer which refers to the fact that the polymer had at least 3 arms or branches and each arm was believed to include a styrene butadiene block copolymer. Sample I was likewise a radial polymer and was prepared by coupling base polymer that was a styrene butadiene block copolymer including diene end cap. Comparative I was determined to include about 30 bound styrene and Sample I was synthesized to include about the same amount of bound styrene.

Comparative II was a linear polymer that was believed to include a styrene butadiene styrene block copolymer. Sample II was likewise a linear polymer that was prepared by di coupling base polymer that was a styrene butadiene block copolymer including diene end cap. Comparative I was determined to include about 30 bound styrene and Sample I was synthesized to include about the same amount of bound styrene.

Each polymer which was in pellet or crumb form was tested according to the following procedure. To a quart can container was added 500 grams of asphalt binder preheated to 163 C. The asphalt binder was obtained from BP Whiting Ind. and had a PG rating of 64 22 per AASHTO M320. Using a quart can heater the asphalt binder was heated to 190 C. The asphalt binder was stirred by using a three paddle agitator positioned about one half inch above the bottom of the can and operating at sufficient r.p.m. to create a vortex in the asphalt. A portion of each polymer was passed through a 4 0.187 inch sieve screen and a 20 gram sample was collected. The screened polymer was slowly added to the stirred asphalt sample at a rate of about 20 gram per minute. Stirring continued for 30 minutes at 190 C. during which time a scraping tool was employed to break up clumps of polymer.

After 30 minutes of mixing the mixture of asphalt binder and polymer are passed through a pre weighed 20 mesh sieve screen. The screen with residue of the mixture is placed onto another quart can and placed into an oven at 163 C. for one hour. After cooling for 15 minutes the screen and residue of the mixture are weighed. For purposes of this analysis the weight of the residue remaining on the screen is assumed to be undissolved polymer which is reported in Table I as a percentage of the original 20 gram sample as the 30 minute melt test.

The Mp of the sample was determined using GPC analysis with polystyrene standards. As noted within this specification the Mp represent the peak average molecular weight. As is known in the art a multi modal polymer or one that is partially coupled it should be understood that each peak may have its own Mp. The degree of coupling was determined from the area of the peak in question as a function of the overall area under the curve using standard GPC analysis. The vinyl content of the polymer was determined by IR analysis.

As can be determined from the results of the tests the polymers including diene end caps dissolved in the asphalt to a markedly greater extent than the Comparative polymer which did not include the diene end cap. Those skilled in the art appreciate that the particle size of the polymer could impact the rate at which the polymer dissolves in the asphalt. While the polymer was screened to establish a maximum particle size variability within the particle sizes of the polymer could impact the results of this test. But visual inspection of the polymer particles indicated that there was not a great degree of difference in particle size and therefore it was concluded that the difference in rate of dissolvability was attributable to the diene end cap.

Using anionic polymerization techniques block styrene butadiene polymer with a diene end cap was prepared and di coupled to form a linear polymer Samples 4 6 or coupled for form radial polymer Samples 7 9 . The characteristics of the polymers prepared are provided in Table II. The polymer samples were likewise analyzed using the 30 minute melt test described above and the results thereof are provided in Table II.

As can be determined from the results of the tests the size of the diene end cap is directly proportional to the rate at which the polymer both linear and radial dissolve in the asphalt. Accordingly it was unexpectedly discovered that a technologically useful balance of properties could be achieved by varying the length of the diene end cap.

Various modifications and alterations that do not depart from the scope and spirit of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art. This invention is not to be duly limited to the illustrative embodiments set forth herein.
