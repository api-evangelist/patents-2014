The present application relates generally to data processing systems and in one specific example to techniques for predicting a user response to e mail content.

Social network services such as LinkedIn reach out to many members via email. These emails may contain information about news articles influencer posts connection updates group discussions marketing content etc.

Example methods and systems for predicting a user response to e mail content are described. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of example embodiments. It will be evident however to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details.

According to various exemplary embodiments described herein an email response prediction system is configured to predict the likelihood of a user performing a user action on a particular email content item. For example the email response prediction system may predict the likelihood that a particular member of an online social network service e.g. LinkedIn will click on a particular item in a digest email. As another example the e mail response prediction system may predict the likelihood that a particular member of the online social network service will access open or view any mail. Accordingly the email response prediction system described herein is configured to determine or predict what emails or what content within emails a member of an online social network service is likely to interact with. This information may be used by the email response prediction system to for example downshift filter out certain emails to members if the email response prediction system determines that there s a low likelihood of a click on that email which may reduce costs and member annoyance while dramatically improving click through rate CTR .

The email response prediction system may include various types of component modules including a source module that encodes raw data from external data sources into feature vectors and assembles the feature vectors to generate an assembled feature vector. In some embodiments the assembled feature vector output by the source module may include various features describing a member of a social networking website a particular email content item a member s email activities a member s other activities on the social networking website activities of similar members activities of a member s connections and so on. The assembled feature vector may then be passed to a prediction module for predicting whether the particular member will click on the particular email content item.

The prediction module may use any one of various known prediction modeling techniques to perform the prediction modeling. For example the prediction module may apply a statistics based machine learning model such as a logistic regression model to the features in the assembled feature vector. For example the email response prediction system may use an L2 regularized logistic regression i.e. 

Thus to improve the user experience for a given member and email type or content an email response prediction system predicts the response probability where the response can be a click registration or any other activity . With such a probability a number of actions can be taken including deciding not to send the email recommending an un subscription personalizing the email by re ordering the contents portfolio optimization processes where the e mail response prediction system adjusts various aspects of e mail distribution to conform to members interests holistically and so on.

As shown in the data layer includes several databases such as a database for storing profile data including both member profile data as well as profile data for various organizations. Consistent with some embodiments when a person initially registers to become a member of the social network service the person will be prompted to provide some personal information such as his or her name age e.g. birthdate gender interests contact information home town address the names of the member s spouse and or family members educational background e.g. schools majors matriculation and or graduation dates etc. employment history skills professional organizations and so on. This information is stored for example in the database with reference number . Similarly when a representative of an organization initially registers the organization with the social network service the representative may be prompted to provide certain information about the organization. This information may be stored for example in the database with reference number or another database not shown . With some embodiments the profile data may be processed e.g. in the background or offline to generate various derived profile data. For example if a member has provided information about various job titles the member has held with the same company or different companies and for how long this information can be used to infer or derive a member profile attribute indicating the member s overall seniority level or seniority level within a particular company. With some embodiments importing or otherwise accessing data from one or more externally hosted data sources may enhance profile data for both members and organizations. For instance with companies in particular financial data may be imported from one or more external data sources and made part of a company s profile.

Once registered a member may invite other members or be invited by other members to connect via the social network service. A connection may require a bilateral agreement by the members such that both members acknowledge the establishment of the connection. Similarly with some embodiments a member may elect to follow another member. In contrast to establishing a connection the concept of following another member typically is a unilateral operation and at least with some embodiments does not require acknowledgement or approval by the member that is being followed. When one member follows another the member who is following may receive status updates or other messages published by the member being followed or relating to various activities undertaken by the member being followed. Similarly when a member follows an organization the member becomes eligible to receive messages or status updates published on behalf of the organization. For instance messages or status updates published on behalf of an organization that a member is following will appear in the member s personalized data feed or content stream. In any case the various associations and relationships that the members establish with other members or with other entities and objects are stored and maintained within the social graph shown in with reference number .

The social network service may provide a broad range of other applications and services that allow members the opportunity to share and receive information often customized to the interests of the member. For example with some embodiments the social network service may include a photo sharing application that allows members to upload and share photos with other members. With some embodiments members may be able to self organize into groups or interest groups organized around a subject matter or topic of interest. With some embodiments the social network service may host various job listings providing details of job openings with various organizations.

As members interact with the various applications services and content made available via the social network service the members behaviour e.g. content viewed links or member interest buttons selected etc. may be monitored and information concerning the member s activities and behaviour may be stored for example as indicated in by the database with reference number . This information may be used to classify the member as being in various categories. For example if the member performs frequent searches of job listings thereby exhibiting behaviour indicating that the member is a likely job seeker this information can be used to classify the member as a job seeker. This classification can then be used as a member profile attribute for purposes of enabling others to target the member for receiving messages or status updates. Accordingly a company that has available job openings can publish a message that is specifically directed to certain members of the social network service who are job seekers and thus more likely to be receptive to recruiting efforts. With some embodiments the social network system includes what is generally referred to herein an email response prediction system . The email response prediction system is described in more detail below in conjunction with .

Although not shown with some embodiments the social network system provides an application programming interface API module via which third party applications can access various services and data provided by the social network service. For example using an API a third party application may provide a user interface and logic that enables an authorized representative of an organization to publish messages from a third party application to a content hosting platform of the social network service that facilitates presentation of activity or content streams maintained and presented by the social network service. Such third party applications may be browser based applications or may be operating system specific. In particular some third party applications may reside and execute on one or more mobile devices e.g. phone or tablet computing devices having a mobile operating system.

Turning now to an email response prediction system includes a source module a prediction module an email management module and a database . The modules of the email response prediction system may be implemented on or executed by a single device such as a response prediction device or on separate devices interconnected via a network. The aforementioned response prediction device may be for example a client machine or application server.

Briefly the source module is configured to access various data including email content data describing a particular email content item and member email interaction data describing a particular member s interactions with various email content. The source module also encodes the data accessed from the external data sources into one or more feature vectors and assembles the one or more feature vectors to thereby generate an assembled feature vector see . Thereafter the prediction module performs a prediction modeling process based on the assembled feature vector and a prediction model to predict a likelihood of a particular member performing a particular user action on a particular email content item e.g. the email content item described by the raw email content data . The prediction module may use any one of various known prediction modeling techniques to perform the prediction modeling. For example the prediction module may apply a statistics based machine learning model such as a logistic regression model to the assembled feature vector.

In some embodiments the term email content item refers to an email of a particular type such as a network connection update e mail a news update e mail a jobs update e mail an influencer post update e mail a company update e mail a group update e mail and a university update e mail. In some embodiments the email type is a digest e mail associated with an online social network service see the digest e mail including at least one of network connection update information news update information jobs update information influencer post update information company update information group update information university update information. In some embodiments the term email content item refers to content included within an email e.g. a digest email such as network update information Influencer update information jobs update information groups update information universities update information companies update information etc. In some embodiments the email content item may be an advertisement offer promotion coupon special deal an article a news item a blog post and so on included in an email or another notification e.g. text message instant message chat message etc. .

In some embodiments the user action may be a click response a non click response a hover response e.g. the user causes a mouse cursor to hover over the email content item for a predetermined period of time an unsubscribe response a conversion response e.g. the user selects an advertisement or offer in the email and completes a transaction based on the advertisement a like response e.g. the member likes the item a comment response e.g. the member comments on the item a share response e.g. the member shares the item a follow response e.g. the member follows the items a rating response e.g. the member rates the email content item based on a range of rating options displayed in conjunction with the email content item and so on.

In some embodiments the email content data accessed by the source module specifies an email type email format email title email keywords and email image email content item rendering information e.g. various rendering characteristics of an email content item with respect to the appearance of the email content item such as email format email size shape email image characteristics email color characteristics email border frame characteristics email title font size email title font type email keyword font size email keyword font type etc. and so on. The external data source from which such raw email content data may be accessed may be a database data repository storage facility Web server etc. associated with the social network service such as LinkedIn or Facebook . For example illustrates an example of e mail content data that may be accessed by the source module and encoded into a feature vector. In particular the email content data identifies email type email format email title email keywords and email image etc. for a given email. Thus the source module may encode the aforementioned email content data into one or more feature vectors which may be then be included in the final assembled feature vector that is passed to the prediction module e.g. see .

According to various exemplary embodiment the supervised learning model performed by the prediction module may take into account features related to the member s email activities how many emails were sent out for each type and how many clicks were received or if the member has unsubscribed from any types of emails etc. . For example the source module may access from a data source e.g. data sources in member e mail interaction data describing a history of the member s interaction with various e mail content items for various types of emails network connection update e mail a news update e mail etc. . In some embodiments the member email interaction data may indicate a quantity of various email types transmitted to the particular member e.g. over a given time interval a quantity of clicks submitted by the particular member in conjunction with the various email types e.g. over a given time interval a quantity of email unsubscribe requests submitted by the particular member in conjunction with the various email types e.g. over a given time interval . For example illustrates an example of member e mail interaction data that may be accessed by the source module and encoded into a feature vector . In particular the member e mail interaction data identifies how many of a first type of e mail and the user has received e.g. over a given time period how many of the first type of e mail to the user has clicked on e.g. over a given time interval whether or not the user has unsubscribed from the first type of e mail e.g. during a given time interval and so on for other types of e mails. Thus the source module may encode the aforementioned member e mail interaction data into one or more feature vectors which may be then included in the final assembled feature vector that is passed to the prediction module e.g. see .

According to various exemplary embodiments the supervised learning model performed by the prediction module may take into account features related to the member s other activities on the site page views likes the volume and type of the content consumed the searches conducted on the site etc. . For example the source module may access from a data source e.g. data sources in member site interaction data describing the particular member s interaction with various features or content of an online social network service. In some embodiments the member site interaction data may indicate a quantity of various user actions e.g. views impressions likes comments shares follows posts etc. performed by the particular member in association with the various features products or content associated with an online social network service e.g. a content feed a people you may know user interface a search user interface a jobs page a member profile page a company s page a groups page an Influencers page a university page etc. on LinkedIn . For example illustrates an example of member site interaction data that may be accessed by the source module and encoded into a feature vector . In particular the member e mail interaction data identifies how many times the user has performed a particular user action e.g. views impressions likes comments shares follows posts etc. in conjunction with the particular product feature e.g. during a given time interval . Thus the source module may encode the aforementioned member site interaction data into one or more feature vectors which may be then included in the final assembled feature vector that is passed to the prediction module e.g. see .

The member email interaction data and member site interaction data may be stored in a server or similar storage facility e.g. database data repository etc. and may correspond to member interaction history or behaviour history associated with an account of the member on a social network service such as LinkedIn or Facebook . For example the member email interaction data and member site interaction data may correspond to the profile data social graph data and or member activity and behaviour data stored in the databases and of social network system illustrated in . Accordingly the external data source from which such raw member data may be accessed may be a database data repository storage facility Web server etc. associated with a social network service such as LinkedIn or Facebook .

According to various exemplary embodiments the member email interaction data and or member site interaction data may include context data or context features describing a potential or actual context in which a particular member may interact with a particular email content item or site product. Examples of raw context data include time date hour of day day of week hour of week Internet Protocol IP address current user geo location information whether the email is accessed via a mobile device e.g. smartphone or tablet or a non mobile device e.g. desktop the channel through which the email content item is displayed e.g. email application web accessible email SMS or MMS text message instant chat message In mail service on LinkedIn Messenger service on Facebook etc. browser data describing a browser utilized to render email content e.g. browser model browser brand browser capabilities browser version etc. and so on.

According to various exemplary embodiments the supervised learning model performed by the prediction module may take into account member profile data related to the member e.g. member profile attributes . For example the source module may access from a data source e.g. data sources in member profile data describing a particular member including gender age current location previous locations industry education alma mater current job current employer previous jobs previous employers experience skills number of connections endorsements seniority level company size identity of connections networks groups interests preferences hobbies purchase history browsing history ethnicity sexual orientation and so on. For example illustrates an example of member profile data that may be accessed by the source module and encoded into a feature vector which may be then included in the final assembled feature vector that is passed to the prediction module e.g. see . The raw member profile data may be stored in a server or similar storage facility e.g. database data repository etc. and may correspond to member profile data or member attributes associated with an account of the member on a social network service such as LinkedIn or Facebook . For example the raw member profile data may correspond to the profile data social graph data and or member activity and behaviour data stored in the databases and of social network system illustrated in . Accordingly the external data source from which such raw member data may be accessed may be a database data repository storage facility Web server etc. associated with a social network service such as LinkedIn or Facebook .

According to various exemplary embodiments the supervised learning model performed by the prediction module may take into account various features related to the member connections of the particular member on the online social network service. For example the source module may extract various types of data described above e.g. member profile data member e mail interaction data member site interaction data etc. that are associated with the member s connections. In some embodiments the source module may access such information associated with one or more member connections having a certain degree of connectedness with the particular member e.g. first degree only or first and second degree connections only etc. . In some embodiments the source module may access information associated with one or more member connections that have interacted with the particular member to a certain extent degree e.g. exchanged a threshold number of messages posts recommendations endorsements etc. with the particular member and so on. Thus the source module may encode the aforementioned data into one or more feature vectors which may be then included in the final assembled feature vector that is passed to the prediction module e.g. see . In a case where features for a single member connection are utilized the source module may generate a feature vector for the data e.g. the member site interaction data for a single member connection for insertion into the assembled feature vector. In a case where features from multiple member connections are utilized the source module may generate a separate feature vector for the data e.g. the member site interaction data of each member connection for insertion into the assembled feature vector or the source module may generate a single feature vector for the data e.g. the member site interaction data of all the member connections e.g. based on average median mean etc. values for insertion into the assembled feature vector. In some embodiments the activity of the member connections may be weighted by the strength of the connection. For example if the source module determines that a given member connected to the particular member has a strong relationship with the particular member e.g. based on the exchange of a threshold number of messages posts recommendations endorsements etc. with the particular member then the source module may weigh the data associated with this member connection more than the data associated with another member connection.

According to various exemplary embodiments the supervised learning model performed by the prediction module may take into account various features related to members of the online social network service that are similar to the particular member. For example the source module may extract various types of data described above e.g. member profile data member e mail interaction data member site interaction data etc. that are associated with similar members. The source module may determine similar members based on similarities in the member profile data of various members e.g. members that have the same similar titles seniority levels etc. or work in the same industry function area etc. as well as similarities based on other member activities e.g. member site interaction data member e mail interaction data etc. or based on similarities in the connections of the members and so on. Thus the source module may encode the features of similar members into one or more feature vectors which may be then included in the final assembled feature vector that is passed to the prediction module e.g. see . In a case where features for a single similar member are utilized the source module may generate a feature vector for the data e.g. the member site interaction data for a single similar member for insertion into the assembled feature vector. In a case where features from multiple similar members are utilized the source module may generate a separate feature vector for the data e.g. the member site interaction data of each similar member for insertion into the assembled feature vector or the source module may generate a single feature vector for the data e.g. the member site interaction data of all the similar members e.g. based on average median mean etc. values for insertion into the assembled feature vector. In some embodiments the activity of the member connections may be weighted by how similar the member is to the particular member. For example if the source module determines that a similar member is very similar to a particular member e.g. based on a close match between the member profile attributes of the similar member and the particular member then the source module may weight the data associated with this similar member more than the data associated with another member that is not as similar to the particular member.

In some embodiments the features associated with one or more similar members or member connections of the particular member consistent with various embodiments described above may replace the features associated with the particular member of themselves. For example the features associated with similar members or member connections may be inserted into the feature vectors .

As described above the source module encodes the data accessed from the external data sources into one or more feature vectors and assembles the one or more feature vectors to thereby generate an assembled feature vector see . As understood by those skilled in pattern recognition and machine learning a feature vector is an n dimensional vector of numerical features that represent some object. According to various exemplary embodiments the source module may access a configuration file e.g. in database specifying raw data encoding rules that describe how the rotator is to be encoded into the feature vectors. An example of a raw data encoding rule is a particular member feature F located at storage location L of the external data source S is to be inserted into position X of a member feature vector M. Accordingly with reference to the configuration file may specify how the source module is to encode member e mail interaction features into a member e mail interaction feature vector member site interaction features into a member site interaction feature vector member profile features into a member profile feature vector and so on.

As described above the prediction module performs a prediction modeling process based on the assembled feature vector and a prediction model to predict a likelihood e.g. the probability of the particular member performing a particular user action e.g. click on the particular email content item e.g. a particular type of e mail .

The prediction module may use any one of various known prediction modeling techniques to perform the prediction modelling process. For example according to various exemplary embodiments the prediction module may perform the prediction modeling process based on a statistics based machine learning model such as a logistic regression model.

As understood by those skilled in the art logistic regression is an example of a statistics based machine learning technique that uses a logistic function. The logistic function is based on a variable referred to as a logit. The logit is defined in terms of a set of regression coefficients of corresponding independent predictor variables. Logistic regression can be used to predict the probability of occurrence of an event given a set of independent predictor variables. A highly simplified example machine learning model using logistic regression may be ln p 1 p a BX e or p 1 p exp a BX e where ln is the natural logarithm log where exp 2.71828 . . . p is the probability that the event Y occurs p Y 1 p 1 p is the odds ratio ln p 1 p is the log odds ratio or logit a is the coefficient on the constant term B is the regression coefficient s on the independent predictor variable s X is the independent predictor variable s and e is the error term.

The independent predictor variables of the logistic regression model are the attributes represented by the assembled feature vectors described throughout. The regression coefficients may be estimated using maximum likelihood or learned through a supervised learning technique from data collected in logs or calculated from log data as described in more detail below. Accordingly once the appropriate regression coefficients e.g. B are determined the features included in the assembled feature vector may be plugged in to the logistic regression model in order to predict the probability that the event Y occurs where the event Y may be for example whether the particular member clicks on the particular email content item in the particular context . In other words provided an assembled feature vector including various features associated with a particular member a particular email content item a member s email activities a member s other activities on an online social network service website and so on the assembled feature vector may be applied to a logistic regression model to determine the probability that the particular member will respond to the particular email content item in a particular way e.g. click . Logistic regression is well understood by those skilled in the art and will not be described in further detail herein in order to avoid occluding various aspects of this disclosure.

The prediction module may use various other prediction modeling techniques understood by those skilled in the art to predict whether a particular member will click on a particular email content item. For example other prediction modeling techniques may include other machine learning models such as a Na ve Bayes model a support vector machines SVM model a decision trees model and a neural network model all of which are understood by those skilled in the art.

According to various exemplary embodiments the email response prediction system may be used for the purposes of both off line training for generating training and refining a prediction model and online inferences for predicting whether a particular member will click on a particular email content item based on a prediction model .

For example if the prediction module is utilizing a logistic regression model as described above then the regression coefficients of the logistic regression model may be learned through a supervised learning technique from data collected in logs or calculated from log data. Accordingly in one embodiment the email response prediction system may operate in an off line training mode by assembling log data into assembled feature vectors. For example whenever a member of a social network service performs a particular user action on a particular email content item various information describing aspects of this interaction e.g. information describing the member information describing the email content item etc. may be stored as entries in an interaction log. Over time the log data may include millions or even billions of entries representing interactions between different members and different email content items. Accordingly the email response prediction system may access for example all the log entries in the past 30 days where various members performed various user actions e.g. a click or a non click on various email content items and the email response prediction system may convert each of these log entries into an assembled feature vector based on the various embodiments described herein. For the purposes of training the system the system generally needs both positive training examples of where users performed an action e.g. click as well as negative training examples of where users did not perform the action e.g. non click . The assembled feature vectors e.g. the assembled feature vector illustrated in may then be passed to the prediction module in order to refine regression coefficients for the logistic regression model. For example statistical learning based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers technique may be utilized for this task.

Thereafter once the regression coefficients are determined the email response prediction system may operate to perform online inferences based on the trained model including the trained model coefficients on a single assembled feature vector. For example according to various exemplary embodiments described herein the email response prediction system is configured to predict the likelihood that a particular member will perform a particular user action for various email content items in order to determine which of the various email content items should be displayed to the particular member in the particular context. For example suppose an online social network service is attempting to determine what type of email or content within an email should be sent to a user John Smith. The email response prediction system may predict the likelihood that the particular member John Smith will click on various email content items such as email content item E E E etc. given the particular context. Thereafter the email response prediction system may rank the email content items E E E etc. based on how likely it is that the user will perform the user action e.g. click on each of the email content items given the particular context. For example if the likelihood that the member will click on E and E is low but the likelihood that the member will click on E is high then email content item E may be ranked higher than E and E. Accordingly the email response prediction system may determine that E should be displayed to the member instead of E or E or that E should be displayed higher or more prominently than E or E since the prediction module has determined that the member is more likely to click on E than E or E. Accordingly this online inference process may be performed whenever an email is to be transmitted to a member and a determination is to be made as to what content should be displayed in the email.

In some embodiments after the prediction module determines the likelihood that a particular member performs a particular user action e.g. clicks opens views etc. on an e mail content item e.g. a particular type of e mail such as a network update e mail jobs update e mail a news update e mail etc. the email management module of the email response prediction system may compare the likelihood with various predetermined thresholds in order to adjust downshift or refine the quantity frequency and type of e mails being transmitted to the particular member.

In some embodiments if the predicted likelihood is lower than a predetermined threshold e.g. indicating that the particular member is not likely to click on that e mail content item then the email management module may reduce the distribution of that type of e mail content item to the particular member. For example in some embodiments the email management module may adjust e mail preference settings associated with the particular member e.g. see to cause the reduction in the distribution of that particular type of e mail content item to the particular member. For example in some embodiments the email management module may reduce the frequency of that particular type of e mail from being transmitted to the member e.g. from daily to weekly or monthly etc. . In some embodiments the email management module may temporarily prevent that e mail type from being transmitted to the member e.g. the email management module may prevent the next X e mails of that type from being transmitted to the member or the email management module may prevent that e mail type from being transmitted to the member for a given time period such as the next week or month or six months etc. . In some embodiments the email management module may automatically unsubscribe the user from that type of e mail. In some embodiments the email management module may reduce a quantity of that e mail content item within an e mail message e.g. only 2 news items per e mail instead of 10 news items per e mail . The may reduce this quantity of e mail content type either temporarily or indefinitely e.g. until the user changes the appropriate settings in their e mail preference settings .

In the case of a digest e mail which may include network updates news updates influencer posts group updates etc. if the prediction module determines that the likelihood that the particular member will perform the user action on that e mail content item is lower than a specific threshold then the email management module may reduce the distribution of that particular e mail content item in the digest e mails. For example the email management module may remove the e mail content type from the digest e mail indefinitely e.g. until the user changes the appropriate settings in their e mail preference settings . As another example the email management module may remove the e mail content type from the digest e mail temporarily e.g. for the next X digest e mails or for a given time period such as the next week or month or six months etc. . As another example the email management module may reduce a quantity of that e mail content item within the digest e mail message e.g. only two news items per digest e mail instead of 10 news items per digest e mail . As another example the email management module may reorder the contents of the digest email placing email content item lower or less prominently in the digest email.

In some embodiments if the likelihood is higher than a predetermined threshold e.g. indicating that the particular member is likely to click on that e mail content item then the email management module may maintain or increase the distribution of that type of e mail content item to the particular member. For example in some embodiments the email management module may adjust e mail preference settings associated with the particular member e.g. see to cause the increase in the distribution of that particular type of e mail content item to the particular member. For example in some embodiments the email management module may maintain or increase the frequency of that particular type of e mail from being transmitted to the member e.g. from monthly to weekly or daily etc. . In some embodiments the email management module may automatically subscribe the user for distribution of that type of e mail e.g. if the user was not already subscribed to that type of e mail . In some embodiments the email management module may increase a quantity of that e mail content item within an e mail message e.g. from 2 news items per e mail instead to 10 news items per e mail . The may increase this quantity of e mail content type either temporarily or indefinitely e.g. until the user changes the appropriate settings in their e mail preference settings .

In the case of a digest e mail which may include network updates news updates influencer posts group updates etc. . In such cases if the prediction module determines that the likelihood that the particular member will perform the user action on that e mail content item is higher than a specific threshold then the email management module may maintain or increase the distribution of that particular e mail content item in the digest e mails. For example the email management module may include that email content item type in the digest emails to the member e.g. if this was not already the case . As another example the email management module may increase a quantity of that e mail content item within the digest e mail message e.g. from two news items per digest e mail to 10 news items per digest e mail . As another example the email management module may reorder the contents of the digest email placing email content item higher or more prominently in the digest email.

In some embodiments the email response prediction system may be utilized for portfolio optimization processes e.g. where the e mail response prediction system adjusts various aspects of e mail distribution to conform to members interests holistically . For example the prediction module may utilize the calculated likelihoods for the purposes of e mail portfolio optimization by placing more or less restrictions on the amounts type characteristics and so on e mails sent to one or more members of an online social network. For example the prediction module may limit the total number of e mails per member and or maintain a global click through rate CTR across all e mails or e mails of a particular type and or limit a number of e mails sent to members per e mail type e.g. job related e mails and so on. Thus the email response prediction system may adjust the frequency of email distribution via thresholds as described elsewhere herein or via a more holistic approach where a number of parameters can be optimized simultaneously or a number of different constraints can be enforced simultaneously. In particular in some embodiments the e mail response prediction system may generate and maintain e mail portfolio optimization information per member. For example based on particular member s interests and inferred intent the system may choose a set of e mails every week to send to a member. As another example the system may make sure that the particular member does not receive more than five e mails per week and based on this constraint the system may either upshift or downshift the number of emails sent to the member but will make sure they receive the most relevant e mails . Another example of a constraint is that whomever receives email type doesn t get e mail type and so on. Thus it is understood that the system may utilize a more holistic approach where different types of constraints may be enforced simultaneously.

In some embodiments when the email management module adjusts the e mail settings of a member e.g. reducing or preventing the distribution of certain e mail type to a member the email management module may display a prompt informing the user that the e mail settings have been changed e.g. see and allowing the user to reject the change. In other embodiments the email management module may automatically adjust e mail settings of the member consistent with various embodiments described herein without displaying the aforementioned prompt or the user. In some embodiments the email management module may request user authorization to adjust the e mail settings of the member e.g. via a query prompt displayed in the user interface before proceeding to adjust e mail settings of the member.

According to various exemplary embodiments the email response prediction system may display the user interface allowing a member to adjust their e mail preferences settings. For example the email management module may display the user interface illustrated in . As illustrated in the email management module may display a prompt indicating that the email management module has automatically adjusted the e mail preferences of the user consistent with various embodiments described herein.

In some embodiments the system may take into account a relevance of the email content considering the member s profile skills past experience seniority level function area etc. . In some embodiments for the representation of the features the system use a number of techniques including computing confidence intervals based on historical actions depending on their distribution e.g. binomial distribution etc. and use the boundary values as features.

As described in various embodiments above some e mails such as personalized digest e mails may include various types of content therein. In some embodiments a particular e mail such as a digest e mail may include a specific portion of content e.g. at the bottom of the e mail that may be referred to as promotion content or sample content that displays information about a particular product or service such as a product or service associated with an online social network service e.g. a people you may know a network update stream product on the LinkedIn social network service . Thus the promotion content may be similar to an advertisement and may be configured to promote or provide a user with a sample of different types of products and services of the online social network service. For example illustrates an exemplary e mail e.g. digest e mail where the e mail includes a main portion with one or more pieces of content as well as a lower portion that includes promotion content . Such promotion content may be included in any type of e mail such as network update e mails content to digest e mails group digest e mails and so on in order to encourage users to become engaged with various products on LinkedIn or another website or service. It is understood that an email may include multiple instances of promotion content anywhere in the email and not necessarily at the bottom of the email .

Accordingly the framework and techniques described in various embodiments herein may be utilized to find what piece of promotion content makes more sense for each e mail and or for each user. More specifically the e mail response prediction system may be utilized to determine the particular type and form of promotion content that is most appropriate to include in a particular e mail having other types of content consistent with various embodiments described herein. For example the e mail content response prediction system may predict that if the member is more likely to be engaged with this type of product the system may determine that promotion content related to that type of product should be included in the e mail. As another example if the email content response prediction system determines that users viewing emails already including content types A B and C are more likely to be interested in content related to D but not content related to E the system may choose promotion content related to D as appropriate. More specifically for a given slot position in given e mail type the e mail response prediction system is configured to rank n number of external sources of content that were not originally part of that e mail and to choose one or more of the external sources of content to be displayed as the promotion content as illustrated in . And depending on the type of e mail or the content included in the email this ranked list will change. For example sometimes a particular piece of promotion content will not make sense a given type of e mail e.g. if other more detailed content related to the same product is already included in the email . Thus it is understood that various embodiments described here may be applied to selecting promotion content to include in an e mail.

As described above various features such as email activities other activities on site e.g. page views searches etc. social network activities context hour of day mobile geo etc. member profile data member connections similar members features and so on may be tied into and defined in feature vectors. In alternative embodiments the system may not necessarily use all of the features as part of a vector and instead may utilize them in a slightly different manner such as to train different models in a segmented model approach. This may be advantageous because it is possible that there are some features that change the model behavior dramatically. For example suppose the behavior of jobseekers may be dramatically different from that of other users on LinkedIn . Accordingly if the system trains a model using examples only from job seekers the model behavior may be highly specialized because the behavior of jobseekers is in this example dramatically different from that of other members. But if the system includes both job seekers and non job seekers together the overall model performance may not be as successful at predicting the responses of job seekers and non job seekers with their own specialized models. Thus the email response prediction system may utilize a segmented model approach where data is split based on some criteria e.g. features of job seekers vs. features of non jobseekers and separate models are trained for different data sets e.g. features of job seekers vs. features of non jobseekers .

Various techniques and embodiments described herein may be applied in the context of a Delivery Time Optimization DTO process or campaign. For example the email response prediction system may identify when would be the best time to deliver send email s to members in accordance with DTO in order to improve the response rate clicks conversions etc. to the email s by sending the email s at the most appropriate time. For example the email response prediction system may predict a personalized delivery time which could be in the form of day of week and or hour of day value etc. for a given member and email pair. The email response prediction system may utilize member s profile data context information geolocation information access time information etc as well as member s historical activities on emails and on the site and any other features as described herein in order to predict the aforementioned personalized delivery time. In a case where there are multiple emails to send in a given time window e.g. emails selected in connection with an email portfolio optimization process as described in various embodiments herein the email response prediction system may predict when exactly to send such emails.

Certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of components modules or mechanisms. Modules may constitute either software modules e.g. code embodied 1 on a non transitory machine readable medium or 2 in a transmission signal or hardware implemented modules. A hardware implemented module is a tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments one or more computer systems e.g. a standalone client or server computer system or one or more processors may be configured by software e.g. an application or application portion as a hardware implemented module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.

In various embodiments a hardware implemented module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example a hardware implemented module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured e.g. as a special purpose processor such as a field programmable gate array FPGA or an application specific integrated circuit ASIC to perform certain operations. A hardware implemented module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry e.g. as encompassed within a general purpose processor or other programmable processor that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware implemented module mechanically in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry or in temporarily configured circuitry e.g. configured by software may be driven by cost and time considerations.

Accordingly the term hardware implemented module should be understood to encompass a tangible entity be that an entity that is physically constructed permanently configured e.g. hardwired or temporarily or transitorily configured e.g. programmed to operate in a certain manner and or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which hardware implemented modules are temporarily configured e.g. programmed each of the hardware implemented modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example where the hardware implemented modules comprise a general purpose processor configured using software the general purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware implemented modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor for example to constitute a particular hardware implemented module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware implemented module at a different instance of time.

Hardware implemented modules can provide information to and receive information from other hardware implemented modules. Accordingly the described hardware implemented modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware implemented modules exist contemporaneously communications may be achieved through signal transmission e.g. over appropriate circuits and buses that connect the hardware implemented modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware implemented modules are configured or instantiated at different times communications between such hardware implemented modules may be achieved for example through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware implemented modules have access. For example one hardware implemented module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware implemented module may then at a later time access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware implemented modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices and can operate on a resource e.g. a collection of information .

The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed at least partially by one or more processors that are temporarily configured e.g. by software or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured such processors may constitute processor implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may in some example embodiments comprise processor implemented modules.

Similarly the methods described herein may be at least partially processor implemented. For example at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or processors or processor implemented modules. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors not only residing within a single machine but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments the processor or processors may be located in a single location e.g. within a home environment an office environment or as a server farm while in other embodiments the processors may be distributed across a number of locations.

The one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a cloud computing environment or as a software as a service SaaS . For example at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers as examples of machines including processors these operations being accessible via a network e.g. the Internet and via one or more appropriate interfaces e.g. Application Program Interfaces APIs . 

Example embodiments may be implemented in digital electronic circuitry or in computer hardware firmware software or in combinations of them. Example embodiments may be implemented using a computer program product e.g. a computer program tangibly embodied in an information carrier e.g. in a machine readable medium for execution by or to control the operation of data processing apparatus e.g. a programmable processor a computer or multiple computers.

A computer program can be written in any form of programming language including compiled or interpreted languages and it can be deployed in any form including as a stand alone program or as a module subroutine or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.

In example embodiments operations may be performed by one or more programmable processors executing a computer program to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. Method operations can also be performed by and apparatus of example embodiments may be implemented as special purpose logic circuitry e.g. a field programmable gate array FPGA or an application specific integrated circuit ASIC .

The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client server relationship to each other. In embodiments deploying a programmable computing system it will be appreciated that that both hardware and software architectures require consideration. Specifically it will be appreciated that the choice of whether to implement certain functionality in permanently configured hardware e.g. an ASIC in temporarily configured hardware e.g. a combination of software and a programmable processor or a combination of permanently and temporarily configured hardware may be a design choice. Below are set out hardware e.g. machine and software architectures that may be deployed in various example embodiments.

The computer system also includes an alphanumeric input device e.g. a keyboard or a touch sensitive display screen a user interface UI navigation device e.g. a mouse a disk drive unit a signal generation device e.g. a speaker and a network interface device .

The disk drive unit includes a machine readable medium on which is stored one or more sets of instructions and data structures e.g. software embodying or utilized by any one or more of the methodologies or functions described herein. The instructions may also reside completely or at least partially within the main memory and or within the processor during execution thereof by the computer system the main memory and the processor also constituting machine readable media.

While the machine readable medium is shown in an example embodiment to be a single medium the term machine readable medium may include a single medium or multiple media e.g. a centralized or distributed database and or associated caches and servers that store the one or more instructions or data structures. The term machine readable medium shall also be taken to include any tangible medium that is capable of storing encoding or carrying instructions for execution by the machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present invention or that is capable of storing encoding or carrying data structures utilized by or associated with such instructions. The term machine readable medium shall accordingly be taken to include but not be limited to solid state memories and optical and magnetic media. Specific examples of machine readable media include non volatile memory including by way of example semiconductor memory devices e.g. Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory EPROM Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory EEPROM and flash memory devices magnetic disks such as internal hard disks and removable disks magneto optical disks and CD ROM and DVD ROM disks.

The instructions may further be transmitted or received over a communications network using a transmission medium. The instructions may be transmitted using the network interface device and any one of a number of well known transfer protocols e.g. HTTP . Examples of communication networks include a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN the Internet mobile telephone networks Plain Old Telephone POTS networks and wireless data networks e.g. WiFi LTE and WiMAX networks . The term transmission medium shall be taken to include any intangible medium that is capable of storing encoding or carrying instructions for execution by the machine and includes digital or analog communications signals or other intangible media to facilitate communication of such software.
