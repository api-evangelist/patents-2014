The United States Government has rights in this invention pursuant to Contract No. DE AC02 06CH11357 between the United States Government and UChicago Argonne LLC representing Argonne National Laboratory.

This invention relates to electrode materials for electrochemical cells and batteries. Such cells and batteries are used widely to power numerous devices for example portable electronic appliances and medical transportation aerospace and defense systems.

This invention relates to positive electrode materials cathodes for electrochemical cells and batteries. More specifically the invention relates to lithium metal oxide electrode materials predominantly those having layered type structures rock salt type structures or spinel type structures or combinations or modifications thereof that contain manganese ions. The invention extends to include lithium metal oxide electrode materials with surface protection for example with metal oxide metal fluoride or metal phosphate layers or coatings to protect the electrodes from highly oxidizing potentials in the cells and from other undesirable effects such as electrolyte oxidation oxygen loss and or dissolution. Such surface protection enhances the surface stability rate capability and cycling stability of the electrodes of this invention. The invention also extends to electrode precursor materials comprising manganese ions and to methods for fabricating lithium metal oxide electrode materials and structures using these precursor materials. The electrodes of this invention can be used either in primary cells and batteries or rechargeable cells and batteries notably for lithium cells and batteries.

In one aspect the present invention provides a positive electrode for an electrochemical cell. The electrode is formed by contacting a hydrogen lithium manganese oxide material with one or more metal ions e.g. in an aqueous or a non aqueous solution or a solid state reaction to insert the one or more metal ions into the hydrogen lithium manganese oxide precursor material heat treating the resulting product e.g. at a temperature in the range of about 300 to about 1000 C. preferably about 400 to about 950 C. to form a powdered metal oxide composition and forming an electrode from the powdered metal oxide composition e.g. by casting a composition comprising the metal oxide powder and a binder onto a substrate such as a metal foil . The hydrogen lithium manganese oxide material preferably has a layered type structure that comprises hydrogen lithium manganese and oxygen ions wherein the oxygen ions are preferably arranged in alternating layers forming octahedra and trigonal prisms in the crystal structure of the material. The powdered metal oxide product composition that results from the hydrogen lithium manganese oxide precursor material can have for example a layered type structure a spinel type structure a rock salt type structure or an integrated composite structure comprising one or more of these structure types.

For this invention layered compounds and structures refer broadly to lithium metal oxides LiMOor substituted derivatives in which M is one or more metal ions the structures of which comprise alternating layers of lithium ions interspersed with layers containing other metal ions M. The layers containing the M metal ions can also contain lithium ions. Typical non limiting examples of layered materials include LiCoOin which layers of lithium ions alternate with layers of cobalt ions in a close packed oxygen array and LiMnOin which layers of lithium alternate with layers of manganese and lithium ions in a close packed oxygen array. Rock salt compounds and structures refer broadly to metal oxides MO in which M is one or more metal ions including lithium that have close packed structures typified for example by NiO or substituted derivatives thereof. Spinel compounds and structures refer broadly to the family of close packed lithium metal oxide spinels LiMO or substituted derivatives thereof in which M is one or more metal ions as typified by the spinel system LiMnO 0 x 0.33 . It is to be understood that in practice deviations from ideal crystallographic behavior of these structure types are commonplace such as variations in composition in atomic positions and coordination sites within crystal structures as well as in the site occupancy of atoms and in the structural disorder of atoms on different sites. Such crystallographic deviations and imperfections are therefore necessarily included within the definitions provided above and within the spirit and scope of this invention.

In one embodiment a positive electrode of the invention is formed from a lithium manganese oxide precursor compound that comprises lithium manganese and oxygen ions in a layered type structure wherein lithium ions occupy octahedral sites in lithium rich layers and lithium and manganese ions occupy octahedral sites in manganese rich layers that alternate with the lithium rich layers within a close packed oxygen array. In this embodiment the precursor compound is contacted with an aqueous or non aqueous solution that contains an acid and the one or more metal ions to be inserted. The formation of the hydrogen lithium manganese oxide material by hydrogen donation from the acid occurs concurrently with the insertion of the one or more metal ions. Next the resulting product is heat treated to form a powdered metal oxide composition and then an electrode is formed from the powdered metal oxide composition. As described above the hydrogen lithium manganese oxide precursor material comprises hydrogen lithium manganese and oxygen ions in which the oxygen ions may be arranged in alternating layers of octahedra and trigonal prisms in the crystal structure of the material or alternatively in some other packing arrangement of the ions. The extent to which a hydrogen lithium manganese oxide material is formed as an intermediate product from the lithium manganese oxide precursor compound during the formation of the powdered metal oxide electrode composition depends on a number of factors such as the extent of hydrogen ion exchange the conditions of the processing treatment and the like. Nevertheless it is believed that an intermediate hydrogen lithium manganese oxide material plays an important role in effecting ion exchange reactions and the subsequent formation of the powdered metal oxide electrode composition and structure during its synthesis.

In a preferred embodiment of the invention the constituents of the coating such as the aluminum and fluoride ions of an AlFcoating the lithium and phosphate ions of a lithium phosphate coating or the lithium nickel and phosphate ions of a lithium nickel phosphate coating can be incorporated in the solution that is contacted with the hydrogen lithium manganese oxide material or the lithium manganese oxide precursor when forming the electrodes of this invention. Alternatively as taught hereinafter the surface may be coated with fluoride ions for example using NHF in which case the fluoride ions may substitute for oxygen at the surface or at least partially within the bulk of the electrode structure.

Optionally the positive electrode can comprise up to about 40 wt carbon e.g. carbon back graphite carbon nanotubes carbon microspheres carbon nanospheres or any other form of particulate carbon .

In one preferred embodiment the present invention designated herein as Embodiment A provides a positive electrode for an electrochemical cell in which the electrode is formed by a method comprising a contacting a hydrogen lithium manganese oxide material with one or more metal ions to insert the one or more metal ions into the hydrogen lithium manganese oxide material b heat treating the resulting product e.g. at a temperature in the range of about 300 to about 1000 C. to form a powdered metal oxide composition and c forming an electrode from the powdered metal oxide composition.

In yet another aspect the present invention provides an electrochemical cell comprising a positive electrode of the invention as described herein a negative electrode and a suitable electrolyte preferably a lithium containing electrolyte therebetween. The negative electrode preferably comprises a metal selected from the group consisting of lithium sodium magnesium zinc and aluminum.

A battery of the present invention comprises a plurality of the electrochemical cells arranged in parallel in series or both.

As used herein the term lithium metal oxide and grammatical variations thereof refers to lithium metal oxide compounds which can optionally include lithium metal oxides in which some oxygen ions predominantly but not exclusively at the surface have been replaced by other anionic species such as fluoride ions.

The term hydrogen lithium manganese oxide refers to materials comprising hydrogen ions lithium ions manganese ions and oxygen ions and optionally one or more other metal ion arranged preferably in layers as described herein.

Conventional lithium ion battery cathodes such as layered LiCoO spinel LiMnO olivine LiFePOand compositional variations thereof do not deliver sufficient electrochemical capacity and power to satisfy the driving range requirements for plug in hybrid electric vehicles PHEVs and all electric vehicles. Moreover there is a growing demand to increase the energy and power of lithium ion batteries for other wide ranging applications such as portable electronic devices medical devices aerospace and defense applications and for stand alone energy storage. Conventional electrode materials such as LiCoO LiMnOand LiFePOtypically deliver capacities of 100 160 mAh g between 4.2 and 3.0 V at moderate to high rates. Layered LiMOcompounds in which M is selected typically from electroactive metal cations such as Mn Co Ni and additional stabilizing cations such as Li and Al provide the best opportunity to increase the electrode capacity and hence the energy of lithium ion cells and batteries because they offer a maximum capacity of up to approximately 280 mAh g at potentials greater than 3.0 V vs. metallic lithium. However the highly oxidizing character and instability of lithium metal oxide electrode structures in particular at low lithium loadings as well as solubility effects have limited the extent to which this high capacity can be realized particularly at high rates.

The loss of oxygen from lithium metal oxide electrodes such as layered LiCoOand LiNiCoOelectrodes can contribute to exothermic reactions with the electrolyte and with the lithiated carbon negative electrode and subsequently to thermal runaway if the temperature of the cell reaches a critical value. Further improvements in the composition and structural stability of the bulk and the surfaces of lithium metal oxide electrodes are therefore still required to protect the intrinsic capacity of the electrode from decay and to improve the overall performance and safety of lithium ion cells without compromising the rate capability of the electrode.

Lithium metal oxides with spinel type structure are particularly attractive lithium ion battery electrodes for high power applications. Of particular significance is the lithium manganese oxide spinel LiMnO and its cation substituted derivatives LiMnMO in which M is one or more metal ions typically a monovalent or a multivalent cation such as Li Mg and Al as reported by Gummow et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5 316 877 and in Solid State Ionics Volume 69 page 59 1994 . It is well known that LiMnOand metal substituted LiMnMOspinel electrodes are chemically unstable in a lithium ion cell environment particularly at high potentials and or when the cell operating temperature is raised above room temperature when manganese ions from the spinel electrodes tend to dissolve in the electrolyte. This process is believed to contribute to the capacity loss of the cells at elevated temperatures. Moreover the removal of all the lithium from LiMnMOspinel electrodes notably LiMnO x 0 yields a MnMO MnO x 0 component which itself is a strong oxidizing agent. The surface of such delithiated spinel electrodes can have a high oxygen activity thereby possibly inducing unwanted oxidation reactions with the electrolyte. Although considerable progress has been made to suppress the solubility and high temperature performance of spinel electrodes and to improve their stability by cation doping as described for example by Gummow et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5 316 877 or by forming oxyfluoride compounds as described by Amatucci et al. in the Journal of the Electrochemical Society Volume 149 page K31 2002 and by Choi et al. in Electrochemical and Solid State Letters Volume 9 page A245 A248 2006 or by surface coatings as described by Kim et al. in the Journal of the Electrochemical Society Volume 151 page A1755 2004 these treatments have not yet entirely overcome the cycling instability of cells containing manganese based spinel electrodes.

Considerable progress has been made over recent years to stabilize cubic close packed layered lithium metal oxide electrode systems by using lithium and manganese rich composite electrode structures xLiMnO. 1 LiMOin which M is for example Mn Ni and or Co as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 677 082 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 680 143 and by Kim et al. in Chemistry of Materials Volume 16 page 1996 2004 and by Thackeray et al. in the Journal of Materials Chemistry Volume 17 page 3112 2007 . These electrodes can deliver essentially all their theoretical capacity 240 250 mAh g at relatively low rate for example C 24 as reported by Johnson et al. in Electrochemistry Communications Volume 6 page 1085 2004 . Composite electrode structures containing cubic close packed layered and spinel components such as xLiMnO. 1 x LiMnMOin which M is a metal cation selected preferably from Li Ni Co Al and Mg have also been disclosed as described for example by Johnson et al. in Electrochemistry Communications Volume 7 page 528 2005 and by Thackeray et al. in the Journal of Materials Chemistry Volume 15 page 2257 2005 . These composite electrodes form because of the structural compatibility of the cubic close packed oxygen arrays of the individual lithium metal oxide components. The integrated structures are highly complex and are often characterized by complicated cation arrangements with short range order.

When the manganese and nickel ions are nearest neighbors in layered and spinel electrode structures and in the composite electrode structures described above they tend to adopt tetravalent and divalent oxidation states respectively. The lithium and transition metal ions are distributed in highly complex arrangements the Li and Mn ions are arranged in small localized regions to give the structure LiMnO like character. Composite layered materials can be represented either in two component notation xLiMnO. 1 x LiMO in which the close packed LiMnOand LiMOcomponents are structurally integrated or alternatively when normalized in standard layered rock salt notation as LiMnMO. Composite layered xLiMnO. 1 x LiMOstructures are commonly referred to as layered layered materials which reflects the layered character of the LiMnOand LiMOcomponents. The LiMnOcomponent that supplies surplus lithium to the layered structure plays a critical role in stabilizing the electrode structure at low lithium loadings on lithium extraction lithium ions in the transition metal layers diffuse into the lithium depleted layers to provide sufficient binding energy to maintain the integrity of the close packed oxygen array.

Electrochemical extraction of lithium from xLiMnO. 1 x LiMOduring the initial charge occurs in two steps. When taken to completion above 4.6 V vs. Li the ideal reactions can be represented LiMO MO Li 1 LiMnO MnO 2Li O 2 2 

Despite the removal of lithium and oxygen from the LiMnOcomponent the layered character of the residual MnOcomponent remains remarkably intact. The highly oxidizing nature of both the MOand MnOcomponents however can result in oxygen loss at the particle surface particularly when M Co and or Ni thereby damaging the electrode surface. Electrolyte oxidation can also occur at these high potentials. These factors limit the rate at which lithium can be reinserted into the charged high capacity xMnO. 1 x MOelectrode. These electrodes also tend to lose capacity on cycling the same holds true for layered spinel composite electrodes xLiMnO. 1 x LiMnMO. Layered layered xLiMnO. 1 x LiMOelectrodes in particular are also known to suffer from a voltage decay phenomenon on cycling that compromises the energy and energy efficiency of a lithium ion cell.

Ion exchange reactions from Na containing precursors to produce Li ion battery electrode materials using non aqueous solvents are well known. For example in a recent development Johnson et al. have reported in Electrochemistry Communications Vol. 12 page 1618 2010 that a lithium rich nickel manganese oxide compound Li NiMn O x 1 can be synthesized by Li ion exchange in hexanol from a layered NaLiNiMnOprecursor following previously described techniques as referenced therein. During this reaction it appears that the layered structure converts from one in which the Na ions in the Na rich layer are in trigonal prismatic coordination to one in which the ion exchanged Li ions are in octahedral coordination and that this transformation appears to generate stacking faults in the oxygen sublattice that contribute to the good cycling stability of the electrode and its ability to discharge at high rates. The X ray diffraction pattern of the ion exchanged product LiNaNiMnOshows a strong peak at approximately 18 2 characteristic of both layered and spinel lithium metal oxide structures as well as broad peaks indicative of imperfections in the structure and a collection of weak peaks in the range 20 23 2 region indicative of Li ordering in the transition metal layer which is characteristic of the basic unit of a LiMnOstructure. Li LiNaNiMnOcells provide a stable reversible capacity of 220 mAh g at a current rate of 15 mA g and 150 mAh g at an extremely high rate of 1500 mA g i.e. a 15 C rate . The voltage profile generated by the LiNaNiMnOelectrode contains features characteristic of layered and spinel components in the electrode structure.

This invention relates to positive electrode materials for lithium cells and batteries. It relates in particular to electrode precursor materials comprising manganese ions and to methods for fabricating lithium metal oxide electrode materials and structures using the precursor materials. More specifically the invention relates to lithium metal oxide electrode materials with layered type structures spinel type structures rock salt type structures or integrated structures or combinations of structures or modifications thereof notably those with imperfections such as cation or anion defects and or stacking faults and dislocations. The invention extends to include lithium metal oxide electrode materials with surface protection for example with metal oxide metal fluoride and or metal phosphate layers or coatings to protect the electrodes from highly oxidizing potentials in the cells and from other undesirable effects such as electrolyte oxidation oxygen loss and or dissolution. Such surface protection enhances the surface stability rate capability and cycling stability of the electrode materials of the invention.

In one embodiment the lithium metal oxide materials of the invention are prepared for example by treating a precursor comprising LiMnO which has a layered type structure and which has an essentially cubic close packed oxygen array with an acid solution. The LiMnOprecursor or a precursor containing a LiMnOcomponent is synthesized typically in the range of about 300 to 1000 C. preferably about 400 to about 900 C. . The acid treatment of the LiMnOprecursor can produce a layered lithium hydrogen manganese oxide product such as H LiMn O i.e. in normalized layered LiMOnotation in which the oxygen ions are arranged in alternating layers of octahedra and trigonal prisms and in which the lithium ions are retained or partially retained in the transition metal layers. The lithium manganese oxide precursor such as LiMnO or lithium hydrogen manganese oxide precursor produced therefrom such as H LiMn O may be stoichiometric or non stoichiometric with anion and or cation defects. In a second embodiment the manganese ions in the LiMnOprecursor and the resulting acid treated product H LiMn O may be partially substituted by one or more multivalent ions such as alkaline earth metal ions and or transition metal ions and or other non transition metal ions. The H LiMn Oproduct or other compositions formed by the reaction can react further in a second step with lithium and other metal ions to produce the lithium metal oxide electrodes of the invention after partial or complete removal of the hydrogen ions by ion exchange and heat treatment. Alternatively the acid treatment of the LiMnOprecursor can occur simultaneously in the presence of lithium ions and other metal ions to produce the substituted lithium metal oxide electrodes in one step which is considered a notable advantage from processing and cost standpoints. This acid treatment process is followed by the heat treatment step typically between 300 and 1000 C. in air to anneal the electrode material and to partially or completely remove the hydrogen ions from the material.

Typical lithium metal oxide products of this invention have layered type structures spinel type structures rock salt type structures or combinations of these structure types such as composite i.e. structurally integrated layered layered structures composite layered spinel structures layered rock salt structures and other complex structurally integrated types. The invention extends specifically to include electrodes that comprise at least as one component of the electrode a composite LiMnO MO rock salt structure in which M is a metal cation selected preferably from the first row transition metal elements such as Ti Mn Fe Co and Ni. In a particular embodiment the composite LiMnO MO rock salt structure may be integrated with other metal oxide components such as a layered LiMOcomponent or a spinel LiMOcomponent or both. In a further embodiment the MO component in the electrode structure can be partially substituted by lithium yielding rock salt components or regions of composition LiM O 0

In a further embodiment the electrode materials of the invention may be surface protected by layers or coatings the layers or coatings comprising for example metal oxides metal fluorides metal phosphates and or metal silicates particularly but not exclusively lithium metal oxides lithium metal fluorides lithium metal phosphates and lithium metal silicates to protect the electrode material surfaces from undesirable reactions at high potentials notably above 4 V. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the constituents of the coating such as the aluminum and fluoride ions of an AlFcoating the lithium and phosphate ions of a lithium phosphate coating or the lithium nickel and phosphate ions of a lithium nickel phosphate coating can be incorporated in the solution that is contacted with the hydrogen lithium manganese oxide or lithium manganese oxide precursors when forming the electrodes of this invention. For example the inventors have demonstrated by X ray absorption spectroscopy that when electrode particles of composition 0.5LiMnO.0.5LiCoOare subjected to surface treatment in an acidic solution containing Li Ni and PO ions it appears that the phosphate ions have a tendency to leach lithium ions from the surface of the 0.5LiMnO.0.5LiCoOparticles and that the nickel ions migrate into the lithium sites of the transition metal layers characteristic of the LiMnO type component in the 0.5LiMnO.0.5LiCoOstructure. Lithium extraction from sites at or near the surface of the 0.5LiMnO.0.5LiCoOstructure is likely compensated by the Ni ions and the formation of vacancies. This unexpected finding has immediate implications for synthesizing a range of bulk electrode materials and structures while simultaneously synthesizing and controlling the surface composition and structure of the final product by contacting for example the precursor materials comprising LiMnOor substituted compounds in an acidic medium or the hydrogen lithium manganese oxide materials in accordance with this invention with one or more metal salts preferably in solution for example salts containing alkali metal cations such as lithium cations alkaline earth metals such as magnesium cations transition metal cations such as those of titanium vanadium manganese iron cobalt nickel and molybdenum other metal or metalloid cations such as those of aluminum silicon gallium and the like and or stabilizing anions such as fluoride ions phosphate ions silicate ions or the like. The stabilizing anions such as fluoride ions or phosphate ions are preferably contained in solution alternatively as a non metal salt such as NHF or the like or ammonium dihydrogen phosphate NHHPO or the like as taught in the Examples hereafter. Layered layered xLiMnO. 1 x LiMOelectrodes in particular are also known to suffer from a voltage decay phenomenon on cycling that compromises the energy and energy efficiency of a lithium ion cell.

It is clear from the principles of the invention described above that numerous materials and compositions can be derived from these reactions with layered LiMnO type precursors as depicted schematically in and particularly with H LiMn O type precursors as depicted schematically in in which the trigonal prismatic arrangement of the oxygen ions is conducive to the introduction of stacking faults dislocations and other structural imperfections during its reaction with lithium and other desirable cationic species to generate close packed lithium metal oxide electrode structures as depicted schematically without the stacking faults and imperfections for convenience in . It is believed that these structural imperfections contribute to enhanced electrochemical performance such as cycling stability improved capacity and power and to providing resistance to phase transformations during cycling such as the transformation of delithiated layered components in the structure to spinel. The lithium and manganese based metal oxide materials produced by these reactions are particularly useful as positive electrodes in lithium batteries notably lithium ion batteries that operate typically between about 4.6 V and 2.0 V. The synthesis reaction conditions and composition of the targeted lithium metal oxide material can be modified to produce a wide range of electrode compositions and structures notably those based on layered and spinel type structures and structurally integrated products.

 1 A significant advantage of using a H LiMn O type precursor that contains oxygen ions in a trigonal prismatic arrangement is that H is lost during the fabrication of the final lithium metal oxide product which provides greater flexibility in controlling the structure and the electrochemical properties of the product by tailoring for example the degree of imperfections stacking faults and disorder whereas the Li ion exchanged products from Na based precursors always contain some Na ions which remain associated with the product during and after fabrication of the electrode.

 2 By using aqueous solutions the approach provides the advantage of avoiding the non aqueous Li ion exchange step required for Na based precursors which although possible is believed to be costly.

 3 The reaction method holds the possibility of making an extremely wide variety of compounds and compositions e.g. spinel and layered compounds composite layered layered type composite layered spinel type and unexpectedly composite layered rock salt type structures as well as other more complex structure types particularly those with structural imperfections such as stacking faults and dislocations and those with various degrees of order and disorder.

 4 A particularly significant advantage of the electrode materials described herein is that unlike the prior art that generally teaches a one step mixing of the lithium and metal cations during the synthesis of lithium metal oxide electrodes for lithium battery applications this invention teaches the advantage of tailoring the amount of stabilizing cations in the lithium rich layers of the product by an ion exchange process with a LiMnOprecursor which acts as a template to control the extent to which the LiMnO based lithium metal oxide electrodes of this invention are structurally integrated with and composed of layered spinel and rocksalt components and more complex disordered derivatives thereof thereby leading to enhanced structural and electrochemical stability over typical state of the art lithium metal oxide electrode materials.

 5 The electrodes can be used in other cell battery types such as those containing aqueous electrolytes e.g. those with lithium anodes in conjunction with a solid electrolyte membrane as well as other non aqueous systems e.g. those with sodium or magnesium anodes depending on the cations and anions that can be introduced into a LiMnOprecursor or a hydrogen lithium manganese oxide precursor derived therefrom as described herein.

In a further embodiment the invention includes lithium metal oxide electrode materials the surface of the individual particles being protected for example with metal oxide metal fluoride and or metal polyanionic layers or coatings to protect the electrodes from highly oxidizing potentials in the cells and from other undesirable effects such as electrolyte oxidation oxygen loss and or dissolution. Such surface protection enhances the surface stability rate capability and cycling stability of the electrodes of this invention. In one embodiment the lithium metal oxide particles of the electrode are protected by and comprised of one or more metal fluorides metal oxides or metal polyanionic materials such as lithium fluoride a lithium metal oxide a lithium metal phosphate a lithium metal silicate or the like in which the polyanion is comprised of a negatively charged species that contains more than one atom type for example WO MoO SO PO SiO. In a preferred embodiment the metal fluorides metal oxides or metal polyanionic materials can act as lithium ion conductors at or above the operating potential of the lithium metal oxide positive electrode to provide access of the lithium ions from the electrolyte to the electrode during discharge and vice versa during charge while simultaneously protecting the surface of the electrode from undesirable effects such as electrolyte oxidation oxygen loss or dissolution. Such surface protection significantly enhances the surface stability rate capability and cycling stability of the lithium metal oxide electrodes particularly when charged to high potentials.

In a further embodiment of this invention the electrodes can be protected by a modified surface surface layer or coating comprising metal fluorides metal oxides or metal polyanionic materials that are stable at and or above the operating electrochemical potential of the lithium metal oxide electrode. The terms modified surface surface layer and coating include all forms of surface modifications that serve to stabilize the electrode surface for example deposited particles deposited films anion and cation substitutions compositional gradients at the surface and the like. It is desirable that the modified surface surface layer or coating should act predominantly or exclusively as a stable lithium ion conductor that operates preferably at or above 4 V more preferably at or above 4.5 V and most preferably at or above 5.0 V versus metallic lithium thereby allowing the electrode to operate repeatedly at high rates without subjecting the modified surface surface layer or coating to potentially damaging redox reactions that might affect the electrochemical properties of the electrode.

The metal fluorides metal oxides or metal polyanionic materials may be comprised of one or more metals and it may be amorphous or alternatively it may be poorly crystalline or strongly crystalline with either stoichiometric structures or cation and or anion defect structures.

The invention extends to electrode precursor materials comprising manganese ions and to methods for fabricating lithium metal oxide electrode materials and structures using these precursor materials. In a particularly preferred embodiment the method involves as a first step the acid treatment of a material comprising LiMnO for example stoichiometric cation deficient or anion deficient LiMnO composite structures and materials such as layered layered xLiMnO. 1 x LiMO layered spinel xLiMnO. 1 x LiMO and xLiMnO. 1 x MO or combinations thereof for example a material or structure consisting of layered layered xLiMnO. 1 x LiMOand MO components in which M is one or more suitable metal cations as known in the art and in which 0

In an additional embodiment it has been discovered from the examples provided in this invention that electrodes with targeted composition 0.5LiMnO.0.5LiMnNiOcan deliver high capacities and can cycle with remarkable stability e.g. as in Example 15 and . X ray absorption data shows that the stability of the electrode can likely be attributed to Mn Ni nearest neighbor interactions and that regions of high manganese concentration are likely responsible for changes to the Mn coordination environment on cycling and a consequent loss of cycling stability consistent with the generation of spinel like regions within the structure. This invention therefore extends to a closely related method for fabricating the stabilized layered layered layered spinel layered layered spinel layered rocksalt layered layered rocksalt layered layered spinel rocksalt structural configurations and more complex configurations of this invention whereby a lithium metal M oxide compound in which M comprises a metal cation such as Mn Ni Co for example LiMnNiOand LiMnNiCoOin which the Mn ions are surrounded predominantly by non Mn ions e.g. Ni and or Co i.e. preferably by more than 50 is used as a solid precursor that can be reacted for example with lithium and manganese ions in solution optionally in the presence of other metal ions or surface stabilizing cations and or anions as described hereinbefore typically in a Li Mn ratio of 2 1 in accordance with the formula of a stabilizing component LiMnO at room temperature and subsequently heated and annealed at higher temperature to dry the product and form a composite electrode structure respectively as previously described.

More specifically therefore this invention extends to include a method for fabricating a positive electrode comprising a contacting a lithium metal oxide material wherein the metal comprises manganese and nickel with lithium ions and optionally one or more metal ions such as manganese ions to insert the lithium ions and one or more metal ions into the lithium metal oxide material b heat treating the resulting product to form a powdered metal oxide composition and c forming an electrode from the powdered metal oxide composition. In a particular embodiment the lithium metal oxide material in step a is formed by contacting a lithium metal oxide precursor compound with a solution comprising an acid with lithium ions and optionally one or more metal ions the lithium ions and one or more metal ions being inserted into the lithium metal oxide material during the formation thereof wherein the precursor compound comprises lithium manganese one or more other metal ions and oxygen ions in a layered type structure. In a preferred embodiment the metal of the lithium metal oxide material comprises manganese nickel and cobalt ions such as LiMnNiOor LiMnNiCoO in which the manganese ions have transition metal nearest neighbors or preferably lithium and transition metal neighbors such as in the flower pattern of an idealized LiMnNiOstructure as described by van der Ven et al. in Electrochemistry Communications 6 Volume 6 pages 1045 1050 2004 and Thackeray et al. in the Journal of Materials Chemistry Volume 17 pages 3112 3125 2007 . The surface of the electrode the individual particles of the powdered metal oxide composition thus formed or both may comprise a coating that includes at least one material selected from the group consisting of a metal oxide a metal fluoride and a metal polyanionic material to provide additional stability to the electrode when operated in an electrochemical cell.

From the principles of the invention described above it will be clear to those skilled in the art that numerous materials compositions and structure types can be derived from LiMnO type precursors H LiMn O type precursors or lithium metal oxide precursors by varying the reaction conditions. The lithium metal oxide materials produced by these reactions are particularly useful as positive electrodes for lithium ion batteries. The principles of this invention extends to include other electrochemical cells and battery types such as those containing aqueous electrolytes for example those with lithium anodes in conjunction with a solid electrolyte membrane as well as other non aqueous systems for example those with sodium or magnesium anodes. The electrochemical cells and batteries of this invention can be primary cells and batteries or secondary rechargeable cells and batteries.

The following examples describe the principles of the invention as contemplated by the inventors but they are not to be construed as limiting examples.

LiMnOcan be synthesized typically at about 400 500 C. and contacted with approximately 2 M sulfuric acid or nitric acid at room temperature to form a precursor of nominal composition H LiMn O which is then filtered and dried. For example shows the X ray diffraction pattern of a typical LiMnOprecursor synthesized at 450 C. and when acid treated with 2 M HNO. The broad peak centered at approximately 15 degrees 2 2 theta is from petroleum jelly on the sample holder and the sharp peak at approximately 51 degrees 2 is from the sample holder. The acid treated sample shows relatively strong peaks at approximately 19 38 and 49 degrees 2 as well as revealing a substantial reduction of the peak at approximately 45 degrees 2 . These results are consistent with a P3 type layered structure with H ions within trigonal prismatic sites of one layer and the remaining Mn and Li ions in octahedral sites of adjacent layers.

The H LiMn Ocan be subsequently reacted with salts of Li Ni Mn such as lithium hydroxides nitrates sulfates or carbonates nickel hydroxides nitrates sulfates or carbonates or manganese hydroxides nitrates sulfates or carbonates either in solution or in the solid state and subsequently heated typically at 400 to 950 C. to form a powdered metal oxide composition used to prepare a positive electrode of the invention. One specific example of such a reaction is summarized in Reaction A below 6H LiMn O 5LiCO 2NiCO 2MnCO O 4 LiMnO.LiMnNiO 9CO 3HO Reaction A In this reaction the conversion from trigonal prismatic configuration of the oxygen ions in the layered H LiMn Oprecursor to octahedral configuration in the LiMnO.LiMnNiOproduct can give rise to stacking faults to stabilize the composite structure to lithium insertion and extraction reactions without significantly impacting rate capability.

Other lithium metal oxide compositions can be synthesized by selectively varying the relative amounts of the H LiMn Oprecursor as well as the lithium and the metal salts in Step 2.

In this example the LiMnOprecursor material as described in Example 1 above is treated typically with acid at the same time that it is reacted with the lithium nickel and manganese nitrates in acid solution after which it is heated to dryness and annealed at higher temperature e.g. about 400 600 C. such that essentially all the lithium in the original precursor remains in the final 4 LiMnO.LiMnNiO product. In this case the ideal reaction can be represented as in Reaction B 2LiMnO 2Li NO Ni NiO Mn NO acid 2 LiMnO.LiMnNiO 6NO O Reaction B Other lithium metal oxide compositions can be synthesized by selectively varying the relative amounts of the H LiMn Oprecursor as well as the lithium and the metal salts in the reaction above. Moreover numerous metal salts can be used to prepare compounds over an extremely wide compositional range. Note that in Reaction B oxygen is generated by the reaction to form the LiMnO.LiMnNiOproduct of the invention whereas in Reaction A oxygen is consumed to form the product. Reaction B is preferred to Reaction A because the product is synthesized in a one step reaction directly from a LiMnOprecursor rather than a two step reaction with the formation of a discrete hydrogen lithium manganese oxide intermediate in Reaction A.

For the electrochemical evaluation of the lithium metal oxide materials produced by the methods described herein coin type cells 2032 Hohsen are typically used. The cells are constructed in an argon filled glove box 

LiMnOwas prepared by the following general procedure MnCOwas added to an aqueous solution of LiOH.HO in the required stoichiometric amount and stirred for about 45 minutes to 1 hour. The liquid from the solution was evaporated at approximately 80 C. and a solid product was collected and ground to a powder. The powder was then annealed at about 450 C. for about 30 hours in air. The X ray diffraction pattern of the annealed LiMnOproduct is shown in trace a . The X ray diffraction pattern of the acid treated LiMnOproduct is shown in trace b .

A LiMnOproduct containing nickel with a targeted composition 0.5LiMnO.0.5LiMnNiOwas prepared as follows the LiMnOprecursor produced by the method described above was reacted with the stoichiometrically required amount of nickel nitrate in a 0.1 M solution of HNOand stirred overnight at room temperature i.e. the Li Mn Ni ratio in the LiMnO nitric acid solution was about 1.50 0.75 0.25. The liquid from the solution was evaporated at approximately 70 C. and the resulting solid product was collected and ground to a powder. The powder was then annealed at about 450 C. for about 6 hours in air. The X ray diffraction pattern of the annealed nickel containing LiMnOproduct labeled LiMnONi 450 is shown in trace c and when annealed at about 850 C. for about 6 hours in air in trace d labeled LiMnONi 850 .

In the X ray diffraction patterns depicted in the broad peak centered at approximately 15 degrees 2 is from petroleum jelly on the sample holder. The sharp peaks centered at approximately 33 and 51 degrees 2 are from the sample holder. The X ray diffraction pattern of the LiMnOproduct is consistent with that expected for its characteristic layered type structure. The X ray diffraction pattern of the LiMnONi 450 product shows additional peaks centered at approximately 44 and 63 degrees 2 consistent with either an integrated structure or a combination of structures comprising LiMnO in accordance with the principles of this invention. These additional peaks correspond closely to those expected for the rock salt phase NiO or possibly a Li substituted LiNiO phase in which x can be small for example less than 0.1. X ray absorption data have demonstrated that the nickel ions appear to exist in this compound predominantly in the divalent state. For LiNiO compositions that contain Ni and Ni ions it is anticipated that lithium will be extracted electrochemically in an electrochemical cell to yield a lithium deficient component LiNiO in which y x.

The X ray diffraction pattern of the LiMnONi 850 product in trace d is typical of a layered layered composite structure with the targeted composition 0.5LiMnO.0.5LiMnNiO. This example therefore demonstrates the general principle and versatility of the approach described herein in that improved and modified LiMnO based lithium metal oxide composite electrode structures and products can be synthesized simply by reacting LiMnOwith an acidic solution containing the metal ions which are required for a particular electrode composition and annealing the dried product at an appropriate temperature to optimize the structural properties and compositional parameters for optimum electrochemical performance. Furthermore the synthesis approach taught herein includes the selection and addition of ions in the acidic solution such as F ions and PO ions which can provide surface protection for the composite electrode structures when cycled in lithium cells. In this respect the advantages of this one step approach to synthesize surface protected composite electrode structures from a LiMnOprecursor are illustrated by the examples provided in this invention.

The corresponding voltage profiles and dQ dV plots for a Li LiMnONi 450 cell of the present invention are shown in the respective top and bottom panels of . It is clear from the top panel of that the LiMnONi 450 electrode of the invention provided a significantly higher capacity than the LiMnOelectrode yielding an initial capacity of approximately 165 mAh g which increased to approximately 225 mAh g over the first five cycles. The dQ dV plot of this cell is surprisingly different to that of the cell containing the LiMnOelectrode in that the cell of the invention unexpectedly afforded only one major reversible reduction peak above about 3 V which strongly suggests that the electrode of the invention has a significant advantage over the comparative LiMnOelectrode by suppressing the formation of a spinel phase on cycling thereby providing superior electrochemical capacity. This finding is significant. Analysis of the X ray diffraction and X ray absorption data of the LiMnONi 450 electrode powder before and after cycling indicated that the electrode is comprised of layered LiMnO like regions and rock salt NiO type regions. Moreover the electrochemical data show a continuously sloping voltage profile that maintains its shape on cycling thereby indicating that there is negligible transformation of the layered component to spinel. This invention therefore extends specifically to include precursor electrodes that comprise at least as one component of the precursor electrode a composite LiMnO MO rock salt structure in which M is a divalent metal cation selected preferably from the first row transition metal elements such as Ti Mn Fe Co and Ni. In a further embodiment the MO component in the precursor electrode structure can be partially substituted by lithium yielding rock salt components or regions LiM O 0

This example therefore emphasizes that the annealing step is crucial in controlling and tailoring the electrode structures of this invention and their electrochemical properties.

Ni containing LiMnOpowder was prepared as described above in Example 4 by adjusting the amount of Ni nitrate in the acidic solution to target a product with composition 0.2LiMnO.8LiMnNiO i.e. the Li Mn Ni ratio in the LiMnO nitric acid solution was about 1.20 0.60 0.40. The product was annealed at about 850 C. prior to electrochemical evaluation in the lithium cell and is labeled LiMnONi 2 850. shows voltage profiles of the Li LiMnONi 2 850 cell cycled between about 2.0 and 4.6 V. The cell delivers about 210 mAh g at a C 14 rate with a first cycle efficiency of about 86 . The relatively high first cycle efficiency of this cell as well as the high initial discharge capacity of the cathode 200 mAh g demonstrates a significant advantage of electrodes of this invention and the method of preparing the electrodes from a LiMnOprecursor or a hydrogen lithium manganese oxide precursor derived therefrom the results from this example indicate that it should be possible to tailor the composition of LiMnO stabilized composite electrode structures and to reduce significantly the first cycle irreversible capacity loss incurred by the electrochemical activation process that typically occurs above 4.4 V.

LiMnTiOwas prepared by the following general procedure TiCHO titanium isopropoxide and MnCOprecursors were added to an aqueous solution of LiOH.HO in the required stoichiometric amount and stirred for about 45 minutes to 1 hour. The liquid from the solution was evaporated at approximately 80 C. and a solid product was collected and ground to a powder. The powder was then annealed at about 450 C. for about 30 hours in air.

The LiMnTiOprecursor was then reacted with nickel nitrate in a 0.1 M solution of HNOto target a product with composition 0.5LiMnTiO.0.5LiMnNiO i.e. the Li Mn Ni Ti ratio in the LiMnO nitric acid solution was about 1.50 0.70 0.25 0.05 and stirred overnight at room temperature. The liquid from the solution was evaporated at approximately 70 C. and the resulting solid product was collected and ground to a powder. The powder was then annealed at about 45 C. for about 6 hours in air and labeled LiMnTiONi.

The voltage profiles of a Li LiMnTiONi cell are shown in . The capacity of the electrode increased from about 170 mAh g to 200 mAh g where it remained stable at greater than 99 efficiency on further cycling.

A Ni and Co containing LiMnOpowder was prepared as described above in Example 4 by adjusting the amount of Ni and Co nitrates in the acidic solution to target a product with composition 0.5LiMnO.0.5LiMnCoO i.e. the Li Mn Ni Co ratio in the LiMnO nitric acid solution was about 1.50 0.70 0.20 0.10. The product was annealed at about 450 C. prior to electrochemical evaluation in the lithium cell and is labeled LiMnONiCo. shows voltage profiles of the Li LiMnONiCo cell cycled between about 2.0 and 4.6 V. The first cycle cycling efficiency was about 85 and more than 98 thereafter. The cell delivers over 220 mAh g at a rate of about 15 mA g for more than 10 cycles demonstrating the utility of the invention.

The LiMnOprecursor of Example 4 was reacted with manganese acetate Mn CHCOO .4HO in a 0.1 M solution of HNOto target a layered spinel product with approximate composition 0.8LiMnO.0.2LiMnOusing a Li Mn ratio in the LiMnO nitric acid solution of about 1.5 1.0 and stirred overnight at room temperature. The liquid from the solution was evaporated at approximately 70 C. and the resulting solid product was collected and ground to a powder. The powder was then annealed at about 450 C. for about 6 hours in air and labeled LiMnOMn.

The voltage profiles of a Li LiMnOMn cell are shown in top and corresponding dQ dV plots in bottom . Cells were cycled between about 2.0 and 4.6 V. The voltage profile and dQ dV plots are both consistent with the electrochemical behavior of a layered spinel composite electrode structure as evident from the electrochemical processes around 4 V and the flat voltage plateau at about 3 V characteristic of the spinel component and the steadily changing discharge voltage between about 3.7 V and about 3 V which is characteristic of a layered component. The first cycle efficiency was about 94 the discharge capacity and coulombic efficiency increasing on cycling from about 147 to 180 mAh g and 94 to 98 respectively over the first 9 cycles thereby demonstrating the utility of the invention.

A CoMnCOprecursor was first prepared by reacting the required amounts of cobalt sulfate heptahydrate and manganese sulfate monohydrate in an aqueous solution of ammonium hydrogen carbonate to yield a CoMnCOprecipitate that was subsequently dried overnight at about 100 C. LiCOwas then mechanically mixed with the dried CoMnCOprecursor using a Li Co Mn ratio of about 1.5 0.5 0.5 before being annealed in air at 550 C. for 24 hours. The sample was subsequently cooled to room temperature before being heated at 850 C. for 12 hours to yield a product with the targeted composition 0.5LiMnO.0.5LiCoO. Thereafter the product was immersed in a coating solution consisting of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate glycolic acid nickel nitrate and lithium nitrate using a Li Ni P ratio of about 1 1 1 and a targeted Li Ni POmass of about 4 to 5 of the 0.5LiMnO.0.5LiCoOproduct and then heated to dryness at approximately 60 to 70 C. The Li Ni POcoated product was finally annealed at about 550 C. prior to electrochemical evaluation in the lithium cell and is labeled LiMnO Co LiNiPO. top shows the initial voltage profile of the Li LiMnOCo LiNiPOcell cycled between about 2.0 and 4.6 V and bottom the capacity vs. cycle number for the initial 80 cycles. The cycling efficiency was about 82 on the first cycle about 100 after 40 cycles and about 99 after 80 cycles. The cell delivered more than 200 mAh g after 40 cycles and more than 190 mAh g after 80 cycles at a rate of about 15 mA g.

Alternatively a LiMnOCo LiNiPOmaterial of this invention can be prepared as follows A Co containing LiMnOpowder is prepared as described in Example 4 by adjusting the amount of cobalt nitrate in the acidic solution to target the composition 0.5LiMnO.0.5LiCoO i.e. the Li Mn Co ratio in the LiMnO nitric acid solution is about 1.50 0.50 0.50. At the same time a small amount of lithium nitrate nickel nitrate and NH H POwith a Li Ni P ratio of about 1 1 1 constituting about 4 to 5 of the mass of the targeted 0.5LiMnO.0.5LiCoOproduct is added to the starting solution to simultaneously participate in the reaction to form the phosphate based coating on the product particles. The product is then annealed at about 550 C. prior to electrochemical evaluation in the lithium cell. Similarly a LiMnOCo LiPOor LiMnOCo LiF electrode material can be prepared by adding the required amounts of Li PO and F ions to the starting solution. These processes demonstrate the utility of this invention and in particular that composite electrode materials with protective coating constituents can be manufactured in a single step by contacting a LiMnOprecursor with additional stabilizing metal cations and or anions in an acidic solution followed by 1 heat treating the resulting product to form the powdered metal oxide composition and 2 forming an electrode from the powdered metal oxide composition.

A LiMnOproduct containing nickel with a targeted composition of 0.5LiMnO.0.5LiMnNiOwas prepared as in Example 4 above with the exception that an amount of NHF was added to the solution simultaneously with the Ni nitrate so that the total amount of F in the final product was about 2.5 mol with respect to all metals i.e. Li Mn Ni . The dried powders were collected ground and annealed at 450 C. and 850 C. for 6 hours in air. Samples are labeled as LiMnONiF 450 and LiMnONiF 850 respectively.

The voltage profiles and corresponding dQ dV plots of a Li LiMnONiF 450 cell for the 1 4and 9cycles are shown in top and bottom panels respectively. Cells were cycled between 2.0 and 4.6 V at a 15 mA g rate. The first cycle efficiency of this cell was about 87 which is significantly higher than typically delivered by cells containing conventional LiMnO based composite electrode structures. The 10 cycle average discharge capacity of the fluorinated LiMnONiF 450 cathode was about 220 mAh g.

The voltage profiles and corresponding dQ dV plots of a Li LiMnONiF 850 cell for the 1 4 and 9th cycles are shown in . Cells were cycled between 2.0 and 4.6 V at a 15 mA g rate. The first cycle efficiency of this cell was about 80 with a first cycle charge capacity of about 296 mAh g and subsequent discharge capacity of about 236 mAh g. The LiMnONiF 850 cathode provided an average discharge capacity of about 248 mAh g.

These observations along with the excellent stability of the discharge process as demonstrated in particular by the dQ dV data in that shows a predominant discharge process slightly above 3 V demonstrate the flexibility of the method of this invention in preparing high capacity and stabilized cathode materials.

A precursor with a nominal composition of LiNaMnOwas prepared by the following general procedure MnCOand NaCOwere added to an aqueous solution of LiOH.HO in the required stoichiometric amount and stirred for about 45 minutes to 1 hour. The liquid from the solution was evaporated at approximately 80 C. and a solid product was collected and ground to a powder. The powder was then annealed at about 450 C. for about 30 hours in air. Subsequently a Ni containing product with a Ni Mn ratio of 1 3 was prepared from the Na containing LiMnOprecursor as described in Example 4 and annealed at 850 C. in air for 6 hours. These samples are labeled as LiMnONaNi.

A precursor with a nominal composition of LiMgMnO x 0.05 was prepared as in Example 11 using stoichiometric amounts of MnCOand Mg NO .6HO in an aqueous solution of LiOH.HO. The dried powder was ground and subsequently annealed at 450 C. in air for about 30 hours. A Ni containing product with a Ni Mn ratio of 1 3 was prepared from the Mg containing LiMnOprecursor as described in Example 4 and annealed at 450 C. in air for 6 hours. Samples are labeled as LiMnOMgNi 5 .

The top and bottom panels in show the voltage profiles and corresponding dQ dV plots respectively for the 1 5and 10cycles of a Li LiMnOMgNi 5 cell. Cells were cycled between 2.0 and 4.6 V at a 15 mA g rate. The first cycle efficiency surprisingly was about 98 with the discharge capacity increasing to about 210 mAh g after 10 cycles. Of additional significance is the stabilization of the discharge process at about 3.2V as indicated by the dashed line in the dQ dV plots of bottom panel .

The LiMnOprecursor prepared as in Example 4 was reacted with stoichiometric amounts of Co nitrate and Ni nitrate to target a lithium rich product having the approximate composition of LiMnNiCoO. The final dried powder was annealed in air at 450 C. for 6 hours and is labeled as LiMnONiCo 2.

This example is particularly noteworthy because it demonstrates a significantly lower first cycle capacity loss 12 compared to state of the art composite electrode structures and compositions such as the 38 first cycle capacity loss of a 0.5LiMnO.0.5LiMnNiCoOelectrode reported by Johnson et al. in Electrochemistry Communications Volume 9 page 787 2007 . This improvement is particularly important because it illustrates that the materials of this invention can significantly minimize the extent of electrochemical activation above 4.5 V thereby reducing surface damage to the electrode particles and enhancing electrochemical performance without compromising the exceptionally high capacities delivered by these composite electrodes relative to state of the art electrode materials such as layered LiCoO spinel LiMnO and olivine LiFePOand their analogues that typically provide capacities of about 160 170 mAh g or lower.

The LiMnOprecursor was prepared as in Example 4 using stoichiometric amounts of MnCOin an aqueous solution of LiOH.HO. The dried powder was ground and subsequently annealed at about 450 C. in air for about 30 hours. An Al containing product with a Ni Mn ratio of 1 3 and total Al content of 2 by weight was prepared from a mixture of Ni nitrate and Al nitrate similar to the procedure described in Example 4 and annealed at about 450 C. in air for about 6 hours the target composition of this product was LiMnNiAlO in standard layered notation . This sample is labeled LiMnONiAl.

Stoichiometrically required amounts of MnCOand LiCOwere thoroughly mixed and annealed in air at about 450 C. for about 72 hours to prepare the LiMnOprecursor this sample is labeled C LiMnO. A LiMnOproduct containing nickel with a targeted composition 0.5LiMnO.0.5LiMnNiO labeled C LiMnONi was prepared by the same procedure described in Example 4. shows the typical voltage profiles of a Li C LiMnONi cell when cycled between 4.6 and 2.0 V for cycles 31 37 and 45. These data are comparable to and are in good agreement with those obtained for the Li LiMnONi 850 cell in top which had been cycled under a wider voltage window 5.0 to 2.0 V . The discharge profiles in represent the last 15 break in cycles before the operating window was narrowed to 4.4 2.5 V. The average capacity delivered by the electrode between 4.6 and 2.0 V is exceptional i.e. about 280 mAh g. shows the voltage profile of the cell when cycled over the narrower range 4.4 2.5 V whereas shows the corresponding dQ dV plots for this cell. In this case the delivered rechargeable capacity is reduced slightly to about 245 mAh g. The data endorse the remarkably high rechargeable capacity and cycling stability of these composite electrode structures when synthesized by the method of this invention. This example therefore reiterates the importance of using LiMnOas a precursor and structural template for the synthesis of improved composite electrode structures and their electrochemical properties. Significant advantages of the invention include minimization of the electrochemical activation process the suppression of the voltage decay phenomenon enhanced cycling stability while delivering exceptionally high electrochemical capacities of about 245 mAh g or more.

A LiMnOprecursor was prepared as in Example 15 with carbonate precursors. A LiMnOproduct 0.5LiMnO.0.5LiMnNiOcontaining about 10 excess lithium with respect to the precursor LiMnO was prepared following the procedure described in Example 4 to give a Li Mn molar ratio in the final composite electrode product of about 2.13 and a Li Mn Ni molar ratio of about 1.6 the targeted composition of this example in two component notation is therefore about 0.476LiMnO.0.524LiMnNiO this sample is labeled LiMnONiLi. shows the typical voltage profiles of a Li LiMnONiLi cell when cycled between 4.6 and 2.0 V for cycles 10 20 and 30 and corresponding dQ dV plots of the cell. The average capacity delivered by the electrode between 4.6 and 2.0 V after an initial 10 formation cycles is approximately 230 mAh g. The data show high rechargeable capacity and cycling stability on continued cycling over a wide voltage window 4.6 2.0 V . This example demonstrates the importance and versatility of using LiMnOas a structural template for the synthesis of unique composite structures with excellent electrochemical properties particularly their cycling stability when charged at high voltages.
