This application claims priority to U.S. application Ser. No. 13 782 513 that was filed on Mar. 1 2013 which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 605 523 that was filed on Mar. 1 2012. The entire content of these applications is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates to compounds that inhibit serine threonine kinases and are useful for treating hyperproliferative and neoplastic diseases by inhibiting signal transduction pathways which are commonly overactive or overexpressed in cancerous tissue. The present compounds are selective inhibitors of ERK extracellular signal regulated kinase . The present invention further relates to methods for treating cancer or hyperproliferative diseases with compounds of the present invention.

The processes involved in tumor growth progression and metastasis are mediated by signaling pathways that are activated in cancer cells. The ERK pathway plays a central role in regulating mammalian cell growth by relaying extracellular signals from ligand bound cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase RTK s such as ErbB family PDGF FGF and VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Activation of an RTK induces a cascade of phosphorylation events that begins with activation of Ras. Activation of Ras leads to the recruitment and activation of Raf a serine threonine kinase. Activated Raf then phosphorylates and activates MEK1 2 which then phosphorylates and activates ERK1 2. When activated ERK1 2 phosphorylates several downstream targets involved in a multitude of cellular events including cytoskeletal changes and transcriptional activation. The ERK MAPK pathway is one of the most important for cell proliferation and it is believed that the ERK MAPK pathway is frequently activated in many tumors. Ras genes which are upstream of ERK1 2 are mutated in several cancers including colorectal melanoma breast and pancreatic tumors. The high Ras activity is accompanied by elevated ERK activity in many human tumors. In addition mutations of BRAF a serine threonine kinase of the Raf family are associated with increased kinase activity. Mutations in BRAF have been identified in melanomas 60 thyroid cancers greater than 40 and colorectal cancers. These observations indicate that the ERK1 2 signaling pathway is an attractive pathway for anti cancer therapies in a broad spectrum of human tumors Kohno M. and J. Pouyssegur. Pharmacological inhibitors of the ERK signaling pathway application as anticancer drugs. . Vol. 5 2003 pp. 219 224 .

The ERK pathway has also been cited as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of pain and inflammation Ma Weiya and Remi Quirion. The ERK MAPK pathway as a target for the treatment of neuropathic pain. 9 4 2005 pp. 699 713 and Sommer Claudia and Frank Birklein. Resolvins and inflammatory pain. 1000 3 19 2011 .

Therefore small molecular inhibitors of ERK activity i.e. ERK1 and or ERK2 activity would be useful for treating a broad spectrum of cancers such as for example melanoma pancreatic cancer thyroid cancer colorectal cancer lung cancer breast cancer and ovarian cancer as well as a treatment for pain and inflammation such as arthritis low back pain inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatism. Such a contribution is provided herein.

There is a continuing need for new and novel therapeutic agents that can be used for cancer and hyperproliferative conditions. The Raf MEK ERK pathway is an important signaling pathway which is frequently overexpressed and or overactive in many cancerous tissues. Design and development of new pharmaceutical compounds is essential.

Reference will now be made in detail to certain embodiments examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying structures and formulas. While enumerated embodiments will be described it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the invention to those embodiments. On the contrary the invention is intended to cover all alternatives modifications and equivalents which may be included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the claims. One skilled in the art will recognize many methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein which could be used in the practice of the present invention. The present invention is in no way limited to the methods and materials described. In the event that one or more of the incorporated literature and similar materials differs from or contradicts this application including but not limited to defined terms term usage described techniques or the like this application controls.

The phrase a or an entity as used herein refers to one or more of that entity for example a compound refers to one or more compounds or at least one compound. As such the terms a or an one or more and at least one can be used interchangeably herein.

The phrase as defined herein refers to the broadest definition for each group as provided in the Detailed Description of the Invention or the broadest claim. In all other embodiments provided below substituents that can be present in each embodiment and which are not explicitly defined retain the broadest definition provided in the Detailed Description of the invention.

As used in this specification whether in a transitional phrase or in the body of the claim the terms comprise s and comprising are to be interpreted as having an open ended meaning. That is the terms are to be interpreted synonymously with the phrases having at least or including at least . When used in the context of a process the term comprising means that the process includes at least the recited steps but may include additional steps. When used in the context of a compound or composition the term comprising means that the compound or composition includes at least the recited features or components but may also include additional features or components. Additionally the words include including and includes when used in this specification and in the following claims are intended to specify the presence of stated features integers components or steps but they do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features integers components steps or groups thereof.

The term independently is used herein to indicate that a variable is applied in any one instance without regard to the presence or absence of a variable having that same or a different definition within the same compound. Thus in a compound in which R appears twice and is defined as independently carbon or nitrogen both R s can be carbon both R s can be nitrogen or one R can be carbon and the other nitrogen.

When any variable e.g. R R Ar Xor Het occurs more than one time in any moiety or formula depicting and describing compounds employed or claimed in the present invention its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Also combinations of substituents and or variables are permissible only if such compounds result in stable compounds.

The term optional or optionally as used herein means that a subsequently described event or circumstance may but need not occur and that the description includes instances where the event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not. For example optionally substituted means that the optionally substituted moiety may incorporate a hydrogen or a substituent.

The term about is used herein to mean approximately in the region of roughly or around. When the term about is used in conjunction with a numerical range it modifies that range by extending the boundaries above and below the numerical values set forth. In general the term about is used herein to modify a numerical value above and below the stated value by a variance of 20 .

As used herein the recitation of a numerical range for a variable is intended to convey that the invention may be practiced with the variable equal to any of the values within that range. Thus for a variable that is inherently discrete the variable can be equal to any integer value of the numerical range including the end points of the range. Similarly for a variable that is inherently continuous the variable can be equal to any real value of the numerical range including the end points of the range. As an example a variable that is described as having values between 0 and 2 can be 0 1 or 2 for variables that are inherently discrete and can be 0.0 0.1 0.01 0.001 or any other real value for variables that are inherently continuous.

Compounds of Formula I exhibit tautomerism. Tautomeric compounds can exist as two or more interconvertable species. Prototropic tautomers result from the migration of a covalently bonded hydrogen atom between two atoms. Tautomers generally exist in equilibrium and attempts to isolate an individual tautomers usually produce a mixture whose chemical and physical properties are consistent with a mixture of compounds. The position of the equilibrium is dependent on chemical features within the molecule. For example in many aliphatic aldehydes and ketones such as acetaldehyde the keto form predominates while in phenols the enol form predominates. Common prototropic tautomers include keto enol C O CH C OH CH amide imidic acid C O NH C OH N and amidine C NR NH C NHR N tautomers. The latter two are particularly common in heteroaryl and heterocyclic rings and the present invention encompasses all tautomeric forms of the compounds.

It will be appreciated by the skilled artisan that some of the compounds of Formula I may contain one or more chiral centers and therefore exist in two or more stereoisomeric forms. The racemates of these isomers the individual isomers and mixtures enriched in one enantiomer as well as diastereomers when there are two chiral centers and mixtures partially enriched with specific diastereomers are within the scope of the present invention. The present invention includes all the individual stereoisomers e.g. enantiomers racemic mixtures or partially resolved mixtures of the compounds of Formula I and where appropriate the individual tautomeric forms thereof.

The compounds of Formula I may contain a basic center and suitable acid addition salts are formed from acids that form non toxic salts. Examples of salts of inorganic acids include the hydrochloride hydrobromide hydroiodide chloride bromide iodide sulfate bisulfate nitrate phosphate and hydrogen phosphate. Examples of salts of organic acids include acetate fumarate pamoate aspartate besylate carbonate bicarbonate camsylate D and L lactate D and L tartrate esylate mesylate malonate orotate gluceptate methylsulfate stearate glucuronate 2 napsylate tosylate hibenzate nicotinate isethionate malate maleate citrate gluconate succinate saccharate benzoate esylate and pamoate salts.

The term alkyl includes linear or branched chain radicals of carbon atoms. Some alkyl moieties have been abbreviated for example methyl Me ethyl Et propyl Pr and butyl Bu and further abbreviations are used to designate specific isomers of compounds for example 1 propyl or n propyl n Pr 2 propyl or isopropyl i Pr 1 butyl or n butyl n Bu 2 methyl 1 propyl or isobutyl i Bu 1 methylpropyl or s butyl s Bu 1 1 dimethylethyl or t butyl t Bu and the like. The abbreviations are sometimes used in conjunction with elemental abbreviations and chemical structures for example methanol MeOH or ethanol EtOH . In certain embodiments alkyl is Calkyl. In certain embodiments alkyl is Calkyl.

Additional abbreviations used throughout the application may include for example benzyl Bn phenyl Ph acetate Ac and mesylate Ms .

The terms heterocycle and heterocyclic include four to seven membered saturated or partially unsaturated rings containing one two or three heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of O N S S O and S O . In certain instances these terms may be specifically further limited such as five to six membered heterocyclic only including five and six membered rings.

The term heteroaryl includes five to six membered aromatic rings containing one two three or four heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of O N and S. In certain instances these terms may be specifically further limited such as five to six membered heteroaryl wherein the heteroaryl contains one or two nitrogen heteroatoms. As well known to those skilled in the art heteroaryl rings have less aromatic character than their all carbon counter parts. Thus for the purposes of the invention a heteroaryl group need only have some degree of aromatic character.

A bond drawn into ring system as opposed to connected at a distinct vertex indicates that the bond may be attached to any of the suitable ring atoms.

The terms treat or treatment refer to therapeutic prophylactic palliative or preventative measures. Beneficial or desired clinical results include but are not limited to alleviation of symptoms diminishment of extent of disease stabilized i.e. not worsening state of disease delay or slowing of disease progression amelioration or palliation of the disease state and remission whether partial or total whether detectable or undetectable. Treatment can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder as well as those prone to have the condition or disorder or those in which the condition or disorder is to be prevented.

The phrases therapeutically effective amount or effective amount mean an amount of a compound described herein that when administered to a mammal in need of such treatment sufficient to i treat or prevent the particular disease condition or disorder ii attenuate ameliorate or eliminate one or more symptoms of the particular disease condition or disorder or iii prevent or delay the onset of one or more symptoms of the particular disease condition or disorder described herein. The amount of a compound that will correspond to such an amount will vary depending upon factors such as the particular compound disease condition and its severity the identity e.g. weight of the mammal in need of treatment but can nevertheless be routinely determined by one skilled in the art.

The terms cancer and cancerous refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by abnormal or unregulated cell growth. A tumor comprises one or more cancerous cells. Examples of cancer include but are not limited to carcinoma lymphoma blastoma sarcoma and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies.

It may be advantageous to separate reaction products from one another and or from starting materials. The desired products of each step or series of steps is separated and or purified hereinafter separated to the desired degree of homogeneity by the techniques common in the art. Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction crystallization from a solvent or solvent mixture distillation sublimation or chromatography. Chromatography can involve any number of methods including for example reverse phase and normal phase size exclusion ion exchange high medium and low pressure liquid chromatography methods and apparatus small scale analytical simulated moving bed SMB and preparative thin or thick layer chromatography as well as techniques of small scale thin layer and flash chromatography. One skilled in the art will apply techniques most likely to achieve the desired separation.

Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art such as by chromatography and or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound e.g. chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher s acid chloride separating the diastereomers and converting e.g. hydrolyzing the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column.

A single stereoisomer e.g. an enantiomer substantially free of its stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents Eliel E. and Wilen S. . New York John Wiley Sons Inc. 1994 Lochmuller C. H. et al. Chromatographic resolution of enantiomers Selective review. . Vol. 113 No. 3 1975 pp. 283 302 . Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds described herein may be separated and isolated by any suitable method including 1 formation of ionic diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods 2 formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents separation of the diastereomers and conversion to the pure stereoisomers and 3 separation of the substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions. See Wainer Irving W. ed. . New York Marcel Dekker Inc. 1993.

Under method 1 diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine quinine ephedrine strychnine methyl phenylethylamine amphetamine and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic functionality such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts may be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids such as camphorsulfonic acid tartaric acid mandelic acid or lactic acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.

Alternatively by method 2 the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair Eliel E. and Wilen S. . New York John Wiley Sons Inc. 1994 p. 322 . Diastereomeric compounds can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents such as menthyl derivatives followed by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer. A method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters such as a menthyl ester e.g. menthyl chloroformate in the presence of base or Mosher ester methoxy trifluoromethyl phenyl acetate Jacob III Peyton. Resolution of 5 Bromonornicotine. Synthesis of R and S Nornicotine of High Enantiomeric Purity. 47 No. 21 1982 pp. 4165 4167 of the racemic mixture and analyzing the H NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric enantiomers or diastereomers. Stable diastereomers of atropisomeric compounds can be separated and isolated by normal and reverse phase chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl isoquinolines WO 96 15111 .

By method 3 a racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by chromatography using a chiral stationary phase Lough W. J. ed. . New York Chapman and Hall 1989 Okamoto Yoshio et al. Optical resolution of dihydropyridine enantiomers by high performance liquid chromatography using phenylcarbamates of polysaccharides as a chiral stationary phase. . Vol. 513 1990 pp. 375 378 . Enriched or purified enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to distinguish other chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms such as optical rotation and circular dichroism.
