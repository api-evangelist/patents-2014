Current marketplace solutions cannot offer a secure solution to control limit printing without the need for client side software. Those solutions which do offer security on the number of prints allowed on a device via client side software either require a software package installation or require pre installed software already on the end users device to be leveraged. There are other companies in the marketplace which allow the printing of coupons and other items without the need for the end user to install software on their device but these companies do not offer the security to limit the number of prints allowed on that device.

The claimed invention circumvents the need for a client side installation or the leveraging of already installed client side software in favor of a passive approach that gathers a truly reliable unique persistent identifier for the device that is not bounded by the restraints imposed by the particular client side hardware operating systems and browsers. The invention allows secure printing of coupons and other items while in embodiments eliminating the need for a client side software installation on the client device. The present invention uses this passive approach for obtaining an identifier ID for the user device coupled with an essential validation element withholding process to obtain security.

With this new process no client side software installation is necessary to gather the ID of the device and therefore maintains the security of the print solution. Once the unique device ID is established the number of prints per device can be controlled by transmitting a secure PDF document to the device printer. The PDF document will include the ability to control the number of times a consumer is allowed to print and may in embodiments include other security features such as geofencing PIN entry etc.

Thus embodiments of this new process no longer require the consumer to download client side software. The process gathers device data from a website access which can then be used to determine the uniqueness of the user s device. Thus the security required by coupon sponsors is obtained without the reliance on client side software.

Referring to embodiments of a basic system consistent with the invention are disclosed. A website server configured in one or more computers may receive a visit via one or more networks from a consumer device e.g. a personal computer a smartphone a personal digital assistant to name a few.

Data from one or more cookies residing on the consumer device may be queried for data on previous accesses to the site and provided to the CMS . The CMS may then provide offer content via line back to the server where the offer content may be made accessible served to the consumer device . In embodiments data for site statistics may be obtained via line and provided to an analytics server for compiling the site statistics. Analytics data may also be provided via line to an analysis server and operation . This analysis may include a risk calculation based on data obtained from the one or more cookies.

Request data may then be received at website server via the one or more networks requesting that a given item be printed. This request data is represented schematically by block . This request data may be generated by the website server detecting data that a print button or other element has been activated on a webpage. In embodiments the content management system may generate metadata for the print request to be sent to a print server to be discussed below. In embodiments a script on the website server may be triggered to execute to generate queries and other communications via the one or more networks with the consumer device to collect data for parameter to be used in generating a unique identifier ID .

The website server may then access via line representing one or more networks a device identity computer and provide the parameter data obtained by the script. The device identity computer will then determine a unique device identity based at least in part on X parameters where X is more than 10 parameters and in embodiments may be at least 30 parameters. In embodiments the access to the device identity computer may be via an application programming interface API . In embodiments over 200 different parameters may be used to determine a device ID based at least in part on the combination of parameters determined from the access data and parameter data. In some embodiments a threshold number of more than 10 parameters may be used to determine a unique ID and in embodiments the threshold may be 30 parameters. As an example parameter data may be obtained from browser attributes plug in attributes TCP IP connection attributes cookie attributes packet fingerprint recognition to name a few contained or derivable from the access data and parameter data.

In embodiments the device identity computer may be controlled by the system. In other embodiments an outside identity service computer may be accessed.

Additionally the device identity server in embodiments may also provide risk data accumulated based at least in part on activity recorded against this ID. In other embodiments risk data may be obtained from a server different from the device identity server or may be obtained by accessing one or more databases. In embodiments the risk data may be generated based at least in part on data compiled by accessing a plurality of databases that contain data on individual types of risk.

In embodiments the print request the ID and the risk data may be provided to a print service computer . In embodiments the print service computer may access a database using the ID as a key to obtain print number data based on a number of copies of the given item that are associated with the ID and or to obtain a total number of copies made of the given item.

In embodiments the print service computer may then determine based at least in part on one or more selected from the group of the risk data the print number data based on the number of copies of the given item associated with ID and the total number of copies made of the given item whether or not to transmit or make accessible basic print image data for a basic print image of the given item. In embodiments the determination may always be based at least in part on the risk data. In embodiments the determination may always be based on all of the items in the group. This determination decision point for the print server computer is represented in the figure by the diamond decision logic block Device Allowed to Print In embodiments this determination may comprise comparing in a comparator the print number data based on the number of copies of the given item associated with the ID to a print number threshold value and or may comprise comparing in a comparator the risk data to a risk threshold value. If either of the thresholds is met or in embodiments if both are met then the print service computer may determine not to allow printing of the given item. In embodiments the risk data may comprise a risk score which risk score may be compared to the risk threshold value. Note that there may be multiple different risk threshold values or ranges of risk threshold values. If the risk score falls within a given range of risk threshold values then in embodiments additional data may be accessed and used in making the determination.

When the determining step performed by the print service computer determines to transmit or make accessible the basic print image data for a basic print image of the given item obtaining it accesses a coupon database or a gift certificate database or a voucher database or other appropriate database for the given item represented for convenience by block to obtain basic print image data for the basic print image for the given item.

In embodiments the print service computer transmits or makes accessible as represented by line via the one or more networks the basic print image data for the basic print image containing a print request element within the basic print image but missing an essential element for validation to the device . In embodiments a print request element may be contained in the image data obtained from the database . In embodiments the print request element may be added by the print service computer to the image data to obtain the basic print image data. In embodiments the print request element may simply comprise a button within the basic print image. The configuration of the print request element may take a variety of different forms and is not limiting on the invention. In embodiments the basic print image data may comprise PDF data.

In embodiments website may be configured to determine based at least in part on this history data whether there is print number data for the given item and to compare via a comparator configured in the one or more computers the print number data for the given item with the print threshold value. In embodiments the determining whether or not to transmit or make accessible the base print image data by the print service computer may be based at least in part on results from the comparing step of the print number data from the tracking cookie.

In embodiments of the system and method the one or more computers may be configured to access the device identity computer and to select by the one or more computers via the one of more networks a plurality of the parameters on the device identity computer and set via the one of more networks respective score values for the respective parameters selected for use by the device identity computer in determining the risk data. The score values for the different parameters may be utilized e.g. added to obtain a risk value. For example geographic scoring may be used with higher risk areas or areas where the coupon or other item is not available or authorized may be given a high risk score e.g. a consumer device from outside the U.S. or Canada be given a top risk score of 10. Other risk parameters may comprise VPN usage evidence of previously deleted cookies browser language software version numbers of browser plug ins etc. If a particular risk parameter selected and given a customized score is not available from the data obtained from the script associated with the web server then a top risk score may be given for this unavailable parameter.
