title: Identity protocol translation gateway
abstract: One or more methods of translating identity protocols and a device and a system implementing such methods are described herein. One such method comprises configuring a gateway to communicate with a first identity protocol and a canonical representation, with the canonical representation being different than the first identity protocol. The method may further comprise: including the first identity protocol in a first communication between a first computing device and the gateway, and translating at least a portion of the first communication from the first identity protocol to a canonical representation. The gateway may then translate the at least a portion of the first communication from the canonical representation to a second identity protocol and sending the first communication to a second computing device, including the first identity information in the second identity protocol in the communication.

The present invention relates to the translation between identity protocols. In particular but not by way of limitation the present invention relates to a gateway device performing real time identity translation between a service provider having a first identity protocol and a service consumer having a second identity protocol different than the first identity protocol.

In order for two or more computer systems to communicate with each other the systems use a language or protocol that is understood by each system. During such communication information comprising the identity of the person device that initiated the transaction is provided via such a protocol as part of the message. When the two or more computer systems process this identity information differently due to differing protocols or otherwise the computer systems may be inoperable leading to organizations being unable to communicate. While several different standard identity communication e.g. single sign on or SSO protocols have been created for varying situations to alleviate this situation the different standards do not interoperate. For example several different standards have emerged to enable single sign on across web applications including SAML Shibboleth OpenID WS Federation and OpenID Connect. Each of these protocols enables an end user to access varying web applications provided by different organizations with a single log in. However the protocols are not interoperable so an organization that has chosen to use the SAML protocol for SSO often cannot provide SSO to another organization that chose a non SAML SSO protocol such as but not limited to OpenID. As shown by this example the result is that many computer systems cannot communicate with each other because they were built to speak disparate SSO protocols and are therefore unable to authenticate the users from each other s system.

In addition to the varying separate SSO protocols used throughout the industry there are often several different incompatible versions of any single SSO protocol. For example an organization may implement version 1.1 of the SAML protocol and not be able to interoperate with other organizations that implemented SAML 2.0 created to enhance that protocol s capability. The result is that it requires a very significant time and money investment for an organization to integrate all of their technology internally and even more of an investment in time and money to set up this kind of SSO integration between organizations. This proliferation of approaches to user and session identity management has made it very difficult to adopt the technology in a way that enables collaboration between enterprises.

In addition to the inability of companies to interact with each other due to the different identity protocols being implemented identity information may also be conveyed in varying ways which are not accepted across protocols during web service calls made between two computer systems. The two current standards used by these web service calls SOAP and REST each have a variety of ways of including the necessary identity information in their requests. This variance makes it very difficult for one organization e.g. a company using SOAP with WS Security to make a web service call in order to obtain data from a second organization s computing infrastructure when the second organization has tools and technology for using REST with OAuthV2 for security. As a result if the organizations are to work together in this technical way one of them will have to make a significant investment to modify their infrastructure to provide consume the identity information the way their partner expects.

In order to overcome the inability for many organizations to operate together due to identity protocol inoperability what is needed is a way for each implementation of various identity protocols to interact seamlessly without the need for implementing a proprietary system having a high cost of time and money. In order to facilitate those interactions an identity translation protocol gateway has been created. One such device is adapted to implement a method of translating identity protocols. In one embodiment the method comprises configuring the gateway to communicate with a first identity protocol and configuring the gateway to communicate with a second identity protocol with the second identity protocol being different than the first identity protocol. A first communication between a first computing device and the gateway may comprise the first identity protocol with the first identity protocol comprising information about the identities of one or more people associated with the request. Upon receiving the first communication the identity information may be translated to a canonical representation of the information. Such a canonical representation may comprise additional information obtained by the gateway or otherwise provided to the gateway. For example additional identification information may be included in the canonical representation such as but not limited to user roles user device location or device related information device type etc. . From the canonical representation the information may be translated to a second identity protocol comprising the information. Through such a manner the contents of the first communication may be sent to a second computing device with the first communication s contents translated to a second identity protocol.

Another embodiment of the invention comprises a non transitory tangible computer readable storage medium encoded with processor readable instructions to perform a method of communicating between computing devices. One such method comprises receiving a first communication that is sent from a first computing device to a second computing device. The first communication may contain a first identity protocol and may be received at a gateway. The method may further comprise translating the information about the identities of one or more people associated with the request in the first communication from the first identity protocol to a canonical representation and subsequently translating the canonical representation of the information to a second identity protocol comprising the information. At such a time the information from the first communication may be sent to the second computing device in a second identity protocol.

Yet another embodiment of the invention comprises an identity protocol translation computing device. One such identity protocol translation computing device comprises a first connector portion adapted to communicate with a first identity protocol. The identity protocol translation computing device may also comprise a second connector portion adapted to communicate with a second identity protocol as well as one or more processing engines and transformation rules adapted to process and translate the information in the first identity protocol communication to a canonical representation of the information and from the canonical representation to information within a second identity protocol message.

The above described embodiments and implementations are for illustration purposes only. Numerous other embodiments implementations and details of the invention are easily recognized by those of skill in the art from the following descriptions and claims.

Turning first to seen is a method of translating identity protocols. Identity protocols may comprise data information related to SSO authentication user account provisioning i.e. creation access control and auditing. Such a method as seen in may be implemented by one or more computing devices such as but not limited to the identity protocol translation gateway IPTG described herein and shown with reference to . The identity protocol translation gateway IPTG may also simply be referred to herein as a gateway and may comprise a device or a plurality of devices. For example one or more portions or features described herein may reside on a plurality of cloud based devices or systems. Such a method and IPTG may enable two systems operating previously incompatible identity protocols to communicate without making any changes to their existing systems. For example as seen in the IPTG device may be communicatively located between two organizations comprising such systems. It is contemplated that the term organization may also be referred to herein as a computing device or a plurality of computing devices such as but not limited to a first computing device and second computing device . The two organizations wish to exchange information including at least one of requesting and receiving information in a response to for example an SSO or a web service call. Through the method and or device the requests and responses sent between the organizations may be modified in such a way that the requests and responses can be natively understood by each organization without requiring them to implement additional hardware and or software at the organization in order to support a new identity or security protocol being run by the other organization. Such an IPTG device may be operated by either of the organizations participating in the request response transaction and or the IPTG device may be operated by a third party.

In one such embodiment the IPTG may comprise a service that receives messages from a consumer such as but not limited to a requesting application on a first computing device . The IPTG may translate the information such as but not limited to identity information in those messages into a common canonical form and then translate the message from the canonical form into a form that the message receiver such as but not limited to a second computing device comprising a service provider understands. Identity information received from a first computing device may comprise first identity information and identity information received from a second computing device may comprise second identity information. Therefore the IPTG may send the request message received from the application to the service provider using the identity protocol that service provider has implemented and also accepts the response from the service provider which may comprise a server in one embodiment in the same protocol. The IPTG may then translate the information provided in the response into a format that can be understood by the original calling application at the first computing device . In one embodiment the IPTG may implement a connector for each protocol supported. Connectors may comprise modules i.e. software modules which translate the messages to and from the protocol implemented in the message such as but not limited to a standard protocol e.g. SAML or proprietary to and from for example a canonical representation of the information in the message.

During such communications seen in the identity information of the communication may be passed between the first computing device and second communication device along with any other information entered into the communication during the canonical representation step. For example additional information related to the first computing device and second communication device may be entered into the communication. Such additional information may comprise a location of the user or device or a desired language etc. Through this identity and additional information the devices may be informed which end user initiated the transaction. Identity information may be provided through the use of a username password combination and or additional information provided from a user and or computing device. The IPTG provides the translation of the identity information.

Seen in is one a method of translating identity protocols. Such a method starts at and at comprises configuring a gateway to communicate with a first identity protocol. For example prior to sending a communication between the first computing device and the second computing device the IPTG may be configured to properly communicate with the first computing device . Such configuration may comprise implementing one or more modules or connectors . The connectors may comprise instructions residing on a non transitory tangible computer readable storage medium in the IPTG informing the IPTG how to properly process the first identity protocol associated with communications sent from and to the first computing device . Configuration may also include implementing one or more modules or connectors at the first computing device such that communications to and or from the first computing device may be routed through the IPTG . Upon such configuration the IPTG may be able to receive communications from the first computing device and construct or otherwise obtain the identity information provided with the communication. Similarly the IPTG may be able to configure and send a communication comprising the identity information in first identity protocol to the first computing device . For example the response from the second computing device may be sent to the first computing device with the first identity protocol comprising identity information related to the second computing device . In a similar manner the IPTG may be configured to communicate with additional computing devices such as but not limited to the second computing device . Communications associated with each additional computing device may comprise a different identity protocol. As such at step the method comprises configuring the gateway via the use of one or more connectors to communicate with a second identity protocol wherein the second identity protocol is different than the first identity protocol.

At step the method comprises including the first identity information in a first identity protocol communication between the first computing device and the gateway. The first communication may comprise a communication set from the first computing device to the second computing device which is routed through the IPTG through the use of the connectors . Additional connectors not shown may be used at the first and second computing devices. The communication may comprise a SSO communication or web service call comprising a first identity protocol. The IPTG device may receive the communication identified as the request in and as seen at step of the method of may then translate the information in the first communication including the identity information from the first identity protocol to a canonical representation of the information. In one embodiment this step may comprise the portion of the communication sent from the first computing device which comprises the identity information being modified from the first identity protocol used by the first computing device into a canonical format.

At step the method comprises translating the identity information in the first communication from the canonical representation to a second identity protocol used by the second computing device. For example similar to step translating the identity information received in the first communication from the canonical representation to a second identity protocol may comprise taking the portion of the first communication comprising the canonical identity data e.g. the canonical identity format and translating that to the second identity protocol where the second identity protocol is the protocol used by the second computing device . At step the method comprises sending the identity information originally received via first communication in the first communication to the second computing device via the second communication with the second communication comprising the second identity protocol accepted by the second computing device . As the second communication comprises the identity protocol that the second computing device is adapted to receive and respond to the second computing device may receive the communication access the identity information therein and provide any desired response .

The method seen in may also comprise additional detail or additional steps not seen in . For example not seen in is that the first communication may be received at the IPTG device by an application operating on the first computing device . It is also contemplated that the first computing device may comprise one or more devices such as but not limited to including an application infrastructure device such as but not limited to a SAML device. As previously stated it is also contemplated that the first communication comprises a communication requesting a web service from a second computing device which may comprise a server hosting the service. Furthermore the first computing device and or the second computing device may be use an identity protocol comprising one or more of SAML Shibboleth OpenID WS Federation OpenID Connect SOAP REST and a proprietary protocol. It is contemplated that the application on the first computing device and or second computing device may comprise information related to the IPTG and may automatically inform the IPTG device of the identity protocol running on the device. The IPTG device may subsequently automatically configure the IPTG to operate with that identity protocol.

One method may comprise the additional step of sending a second communication to the IPTG from the second computing device . One such second communication may comprise the second identity protocol and may also comprise the response seen in . Upon receiving the second communication the IPTG may translate the identity information in the second communication from the second identity protocol to a canonical representation of the identity information in the second communication and then translate the canonical representation of the identity information to the first identity protocol prior to sending the information to the first computing device as shown by the response in . The response comprises the first identity protocol.

Memory may include various components e.g. machine readable media including but not limited to a random access memory component e.g. a static RAM SRAM a dynamic RAM DRAM etc. a read only component and any combinations thereof. In one example a basic input output system BIOS including basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within IPTG such as during start up may be stored in memory . Memory may also include e.g. stored on one or more machine readable media instructions e.g. software which may comprise the various modules connectors with reference to and may also comprise the non transitory tangible computer readable storage medium which are described herein as encoded with processor readable instructions to perform for example a method of communicating between computing devices and or a method of translating identity protocols.

Examples of a network or network segment include but are not limited to a wide area network e.g. the Internet an enterprise network a local area network e.g. a network associated with an office a building a campus or other relatively small geographic space a telephone network a direct connection between two computing devices and any combinations thereof. A network may employ a wired and or a wireless mode of communication. In general any network topology may be used. Information e.g. data software etc. may be communicated to and or from IPTG via network interface device .

IPTG may further include a video display adapter for communicating a displayable image to a display device such as display device . Examples of a display device include but are not limited to a liquid crystal display LCD a cathode ray tube CRT a plasma display and any combinations thereof. In addition to a display device IPTG may include one or more other peripheral output devices including but not limited to an audio speaker a printer and any combinations thereof. Such peripheral output devices may be connected to bus via a peripheral interface . Examples of a peripheral interface include but are not limited to a serial port a USB connection a FIREWIRE connection a parallel connection and any combinations thereof.

A digitizer not shown and an accompanying stylus if needed may be included in order to digitally capture freehand input. A pen digitizer may be separately configured or coextensive with a display area of display device . Accordingly a digitizer may be integrated with display device or may exist as a separate device overlaying or otherwise appended to display device .

In one embodiment one or more medium may comprise a non transitory tangible computer readable storage medium encoded with processor readable instructions to perform a method of communicating between computing devices such as but not limited to the first computing device and the second computing device seen in . One such method may comprise receiving a first communication sent from the first computing device to the second computing device with the first communication comprising a first identity protocol and being received at a third computing device such as but not limited to the device . For example the first communication may be re routed from a first destination comprising a second computing device to a second destination comprising the third computing device. Such a communication may comprise a web service call from an application or an application infrastructure communication. It is also contemplated that the communication may include a token and that the third computing device may use the token in translating the identity information from the first identity protocol to a canonical representation of the information and or translating the canonical representation to information comprising a second identity protocol. A token the same or different may also be provided in a second communication sent from the second computing device .

The method performed by the processor readable instructions may further comprise translating the identity information from the first identity protocol to a canonical representation translating the information from the canonical representation to a second identity protocol and sending the information originally sent in the first communication to the second computing device from the IPTG at which point the identity information from the first communication comprises the second identity protocol.

The non transitory tangible computer readable storage medium may further comprise instructions which are adapted to configure the IPTG device or other gateway so that the gateway may communicate with the first identity protocol and the canonical representation prior to receiving the first communication from the first computing device . Furthermore via the instructions the first connector may be adapted to communicate with the first computing device and the second connector may be adapted to communicate with the second computing device . Additional connectors may also be implemented in order to communicate with additional identity protocols. Furthermore information may be added to the communications at the IPTG by the instructions the information being related to at least one of the first computing device and the second computing device.

Turning now to seen is a representation of one embodiment of an IPTG device . Seen are the various connectors with the first connectors being adapted to enable the IPTG device to communicate with the listed first identity protocol examples shown and the second connectors being adapted to enable the IPTG device to communicate with the listed second identity protocol examples. Although only certain identity protocols are shown it is contemplated that additional identity protocols will be developed in the future for which additional connectors will be created and implemented. Therefore the first connector may receive a request to communicate with a SAML 2.0 identity protocol from the first computing device but may send the request to the second computing device with a SAML 1.1 identity protocol via a second identity connector. Similarly the response from the second computing device may comprise a SAML 1.1 identity protocol but the response sent to the first computing device may comprise the SAML 2.0 identity protocol. As seen such an embodiment may comprise an identity protocol version translation. SSO protocol translation may also occur for example between a SAML SSO request response from to the first computing device and an OpenID SSO request response to from the second computing device . Web service identity protocol translation may also occur for example between a REST OAuth V2 request response communication sent from to the first computing device and a Username Token Secured request response communication sent to from the second computing device . Similarly a web service identity protocol translation may occur. For example the first computing device may issue a request and receive a response comprising a username password in a REST protocol while the second computing device may receive the request and issue a response comprising a REST OAuthV2 communication.

Also seen in are various features of the IPTG device . One such feature comprises the processing engine . In one embodiment the processing engine may be adapted to process the requests and responses and may include caching one or more portions of the information in the requests and or responses . The transformation rules may be adapted to transform the data within various identity protocols into and from a canonical format while the authorization engine may be adapted to enforce varying application access policies for the identity information provided in the request response . The crypto key management portion may be adapted to perform encryption and or decryption of the request and response communications while the user data enhancement portion adds information to the communications through for example the data provider feature described above. Finally the redaction engine may remove information from the communications based upon the identity information received and the context in the communications working together with the authorization engine to do so in one embodiment.

Those skilled in the art can readily recognize that numerous variations and substitutions may be made in the invention its use and its configuration to achieve substantially the same results as achieved by the embodiments described herein. Accordingly there is no intention to limit the invention to the disclosed exemplary forms. Many variations modifications and alternative constructions fall within the scope and spirit of the disclosed invention as expressed in the claims.
