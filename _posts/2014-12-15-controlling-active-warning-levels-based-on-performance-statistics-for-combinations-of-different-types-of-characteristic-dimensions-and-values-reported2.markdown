title: Controlling active warning levels based on performance statistics for combinations of different types of characteristic dimensions and values reported by user terminal applications
abstract: An application analysis computer obtains reports from user terminals containing application performance metrics and dimensions having values characterizing the applications and the user terminals. Statistics for each different type of the performance metrics across the reports are generated. One of the statistics, for one type of the performance metrics, that has changed at least a threshold amount between two time intervals is identified, and that performance metric is selected for analysis. For each combination of a different type of the characteristic dimensions and a different value among the values occurring for the type of the characteristic dimension, a statistic is generated for the selected type of the performance metrics from the reports. Information is communicated based on an active warning ID that was selected based on being associated with a combination of the type of the characteristic dimension and one of the statistics that changed at least a threshold amount.

The present disclosure relates to computing systems and in particular to management of user terminals applications and or application servers.

Increasingly users install a myriad of different types of application programs also commonly referred to as applications and apps on user terminals having widely varying software and hardware characteristics. For example users can select from among several million different applications available on various application servers for downloading to cellular telephones sometimes called smart phones tablet computers laptop computers and other types of user terminals for processing. Over a billion Apple IOS user terminals and Android user terminals are presently being used throughout the world.

Mobile analytics is an emerging technology that seeks to measure performance of applications processed by user terminals. Through mobile analytics processes user terminals can collectively generate millions of performance reports every day for processing by an analysis computer. Analysis of the performance reports can require expensive and complex hardware and software resources and the analysis can be prone to excessive error or reduced usefulness due to the tremendous number of combinations of differing application characteristics and user terminal characteristics from which individual reports are generated.

The approaches described in the Background section could be pursued but are not necessarily approaches that have been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore unless otherwise indicated herein the approaches described in the Background section are not prior art to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in the Background section.

Some embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to a computer program product that includes a non transitory computer readable storage medium including computer readable program code embodied in the medium that when executed by a processor of an application analysis computer causes the processor to perform operations. The operations include obtaining from user terminals reports containing performance metrics for applications processed by user terminals and characteristic dimensions having values characterizing the applications and the user terminals. A statistic is generated separately for each different type of the performance metrics across the reports. One of the statistics is identified for one type of the performance metrics that has changed at least a threshold amount between two time intervals. The one type of the performance metrics is selected for analysis. For each combination of a different type of the characteristic dimensions and a different value among the values occurring for the type of the characteristic dimension the operations include generating a statistic for the selected type of the performance metrics from the reports within a time interval having the combination of the type of the characteristic dimension and the value and incrementing a counter that tracks a number of occurrences of the combination of the type of the characteristic dimension and the value among the reports. One of the statistics is identified for the selected type of the performance metrics from the reports within the time interval having the combination of the type of the characteristic dimension and the value that has changed at least a threshold amount between the time interval and a previous time interval. Searching is performed in a list of active warning IDs to identify one of the active warning IDs associated with the combination of the type of the characteristic dimension and the value for the identified statistic. Information is communicated based on the identified one of the active warning IDs.

Other computer program products methods and systems according to embodiments of the present disclosure will be or become apparent to one with skill in the art upon review of the following drawings and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional computer program products methods and systems be included within this description be within the scope of the present disclosure and be protected by the accompanying claims. Moreover it is intended that all embodiments disclosed herein can be implemented separately or combined in any way and or combination.

In the following detailed description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the present disclosure. However it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known methods procedures components and circuits have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the present invention. It is intended that all embodiments disclosed herein can be implemented separately or combined in any way and or combination.

Some embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to improved processes for analyzing performance metrics reported by user terminals. Although the reports can be received from a tremendous number of combinations of differing application characteristics and user terminal characteristics various embodiments disclosed herein may operate to generate and organize the performance metrics from the reports in ways that facilitate use of less expensive and or reduced complexity hardware and software resources.

The user terminals can download application programs from the application server . The application server may for example include an Apple application store server e.g. iTunes an Android application store server e.g. Google Play and or Amazon Appstore and or a Window application store server e.g. Microsoft Windows Store . Although the application analysis computer has been illustrated as being separate from the application server some or all of the functionality of the application analysis computer disclosed herein may be combined with the application server or another computer node network node communicatively connected to the network .

The application programs may include gaming programs spreadsheet programs multimedia programs word processing programs database programs presentation programs etc. The application programs may be selected from among several million different applications available from application servers for downloading to many different types of user terminals. The user terminals may include cellular telephones sometimes called smart phones tablet computers laptop computers and other types of electronic communication devices configured for processing applications.

Although illustrates a certain number of system components for ease of illustration and explanation it is to be understood that embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited to the illustrated configuration but instead are intended to encompass any configuration capable of carrying out at least some of the operations described herein.

Each of the user terminals individually referred to as user terminal may include an instrument encapsulation module that operates to generate reports containing performance metrics for an application program application processed by a processor of the user terminal and characteristic dimensions having values characterizing the application and the user terminal . The instrument encapsulation module may wrap around the application program to intercept or otherwise observe application programming interface API calls from the application program to other application programs processed by the user terminal an operating system processed by the user terminal and or other software hardware resources of the user terminal .

As used herein an API request can be any signaling occurring from one to another software application that may be performed using a defined syntax and one or more parameters e.g. data structure object classes and or variables to obtain data therefrom and or to provide data thereto. For example SOAP and REST service requests can be performed using a defined API library of remote calls or other types of API requests.

Referring to reports are obtained block from user terminals. The reports may be reported to the application analysis computer by encapsulation modules that encapsulate applications processed by the user terminals . In the example of reports may be generated by the reporting encapsulation module that encapsulates application program . The reporting encapsulation module may generate reports at different time intervals such as every minute hour day week month or year and the reporting time intervals may vary over time responsive to one or more defined conditions being satisfied and or responsive to a command message from the application analysis computer and or the application server .

A report contains a performance metric for the application processed by the user terminal and characteristic dimensions having values characterizing the application and the user terminal .

The characteristic dimensions and corresponding values bracketed may include but are not limited to any one or more of the following types 

Raw data contained in the reports can be stored in a memory such as in a structured database residing across an array of networked data servers. Statistics are separately generated block for each different type of the performance metrics across the reports. A statistic may be generated by numerically combining e.g. averaging values of one type of performance metrics in all reports received during a time interval another statistic may be generated by numerically combining e.g. averaging values of another type of performance metrics in all reports received during a time interval etc.

The application analysis computer may generate a separate statistic for each different one of the types of the performance metrics contained in the report. For example one statistic can be generated for the application program utilization of user terminal processor resources another statistic can be generated for the application program utilization of user terminal memory resources another statistic can be generated for the application program utilization of user terminal network interface resources another statistic can be generated for purchases made by users through the application program and so on with other statistics being separately generated for each of the other 19 above enumerated other types of performance metrics received as information within one or more of the reports. A statistic may be generated by numerically combining e.g. averaging values of one of types of the performance metrics in all of the reports e.g. block or in only reports having a defined combination of the characteristic value and the value e.g. block which are received during one of the time intervals. Resource utilization may be reported in one or more of the reports as a numerical value e.g. a percentage value as an indicated resource level among a plurality of defined resource levels etc. or as a textual string.

A determination block is made whether there is at least a threshold change in one of the statistics between two time intervals for one type of the performance metrics. If so that statistic is identified and that one type of the performance metrics is selected for analysis. Although the operations of are described for ease of explanation in the context of a single type of the performance metrics being selected block in some other embodiments more than one type of the performance metrics is selected based on observing changes with those types of performance metrics.

For each combination of a different type of the characteristic dimensions operational loop indicated by block and a different value among the values occurring for the type of the characteristic dimension operational loop indicated by block a statistic is generated block for the selected type of the performance metrics from the reports within a time interval having the combination of the type of the characteristic dimension and the value and a counter is incremented block that tracks a number of occurrences of the combination of the type of the characteristic dimension and the value among the reports. The statistic may be generated block based on numerically combining values for the selected type of the performance metrics from the reports within the time interval which have contain the combination of the type of the characteristic dimension and the value.

In the operational loops indicated by blocks and for each combination of a different type of the characteristic dimensions and a different value among the values occurring for the type of the characteristic dimension a statistic can be generated for the selected type of the performance metrics from the reports within a time interval having the combination of the type of the characteristic dimension and the value operations that include selecting a combination of one of the types of the characteristic dimensions from among the different types of the characteristic dimensions and one of the values from among the different values occurring for the one of the types of the characteristic dimension. The operations further include generating a combined statistic based on numerically combining the selected type of the performance metrics associated from the reports within the time interval having the selected combination and repeating the selecting a combination and the generating a combined statistic for other combinations of the types of the characteristic dimensions and the values among the reports within the time interval wherein each of the combined statistics is associated with a different one of the combinations.

In one particular illustrative example a statistic may be generated block for application program utilization of a user terminal processor resources e.g. the selected block performance metrics for analysis from all of the reports by the user terminals within a defined timeframe containing dimensions and values for iPad 2 e.g. dimension terminal type and value corresponding to iPad 2 Wi Fi cellular e.g. dimension user terminal communication capability and value corresponding to Wi Fi cellular 16 MByte memory e.g. dimension user terminal memory capacity and value corresponding to 16 MByte IOS 8 e.g. dimension user terminal operating system type and value corresponding to IOS 8 application ID e.g. dimension application identifier and value for ID application version X e.g. dimension application version and value for X AT T cellular service e.g. dimension wireless carrier registered with user terminal and value for AT T and LTE air interface service e.g. dimension wireless communication standard and value for LTE . Another statistic may be generated block for the application program utilization of user terminal processor resources e.g. the selected block performance metrics for analysis from all of the reports by the user terminals within a defined timeframe containing dimensions and values as disclosed above in this paragraph except for having application version Y e.g. dimension application version and value for Y instead of application version X. Accordingly two statistics will be separately determined for the particular combination of application programs utilization of user terminals processor resources with the underlying difference in statistics being attributable to whether the reported utilization was from application version X one statistic or from application version Y the other statistic .

It is noted that the statistics may be generated block and the counters can be incremented block from a single analysis pass through all of the report that were obtained block such as by processing the raw data from all of the reports that are associated with a particular time interval. The single pass approach may allow the application analysis computer to process a tremendous number of reports from a tremendous number of combinations of differing application characteristics and user terminal characteristics using less expensive and or reduced complexity hardware and software resources. Moreover the operations can be run in real time as reports are received from the user terminals 

Referring to the continuing operational flowchart shown in an operation identifies block one of the statistics for the selected type of the performance metrics from the reports within the time interval having the combination of the type of the characteristic dimension and the value that has changed at least a threshold amount between the time interval and a previous time interval.

Further to the particular illustrative example above the application analysis computer may identify that the statistic for the application program utilization of user terminal processor resources for the characteristic dimensions and the values as described above with application version Y has changed at least a threshold amount between a present time interval and an immediately preceding time interval. The application analysis computer can compare the combination of characteristic dimensions and the values associated with the statistic that did not change the threshold amount to the combination of the characteristic dimensions and the values associated with the statistic that did change the threshold amount to identify that both statistics have the same characteristic dimensions and the values for the following iPad 2 e.g. dimension terminal type and value corresponding to iPad 2 Wi Fi cellular e.g. dimension user terminal communication capability and value corresponding to Wi Fi cellular 16 MByte memory e.g. dimension user terminal memory capacity and value corresponding to 16 MByte IOS 8 e.g. dimension user terminal operating system type and value corresponding to IOS 8 application ID e.g. dimension application identifier and value for ID AT T cellular service e.g. dimension wireless carrier registered with user terminal and value for AT T and LTE air interface service e.g. dimension wireless communication standard and value for LTE . The application analysis computer can furthermore determine through the comparison of the combination of characteristic dimensions and the values associated with the statistic that did not change the threshold amount to the combination of the characteristic dimensions and the values associated with the statistic that did change the threshold amount that the two statistics are associated with different application versions version X versus version Y . The application analysis computer can determine therefrom that version Y of application ID being processed on the user terminal having the defined characteristics and serviced by the identified service provider and air interface service may have problematic operation because of its excessive utilization of processor resources such as when compared to operation of version X of application ID.

A list of active warning IDs is searched block to identify one of the active warning IDs associated with the combination of the type of the characteristic dimension and the value for the identified statistic. A determination operation determines block whether an active warning ID was identified.

Based on identifying block an active warning ID a warning level for that active warning ID is adjusted block based on an amount of change in the identified statistic between the time interval and another time interval and or based on the counter associated with the combination of the type of the characteristic dimension and the value for the identified statistic. The other time interval may immediately precede the time interval so that warning levels are adjusted in real time responsive to threshold changes in the identified statistic. The warning level may be adjusted block by increasing or decreasing the warning level. The operations determine block whether the warning level is below a defined threshold level and if so the active warning ID is removed block from the list of active warning IDs.

Further to the particular illustrative example above the application analysis computer may identify an active warning ID associated with the version Y of application ID and increase its warning level responsive to continued observe of reported excessive processor utilization in a series of time intervals. One of the counters can be used to track how many reports excessive processor utilization for the particular combination of the characteristic dimension and values for the version Y of application ID have occurred within a time interval and or across a series of time intervals.

If no active warning ID is identified block a new active warning ID is added block to the list of active warning IDs with a recorded logical association to the combination of the type of the characteristic dimension and the value for the identified statistic. A warning level for the active warning ID is set block to a defined initial warning level e.g. zero warning level .

Although the operations of blocks are described for ease of explanation in the context of a single one of the statistics being identified block and a corresponding active warning ID being identified block or created block in some other embodiments the operations of blocks can be used to identify a plurality of statistics for selected types of the performance metrics from the reports within the time interval having defined combinations of types of the characteristic dimension and values that have changed at least by various defined threshold amounts between the time interval and a previous time interval. Similarly a plurality of active warning IDs may be identified block within the list which are associated with the combinations of the types of the characteristic dimensions and the values for the identified statistics.

The application analysis computer can operate to communicate information based on the identified one of the active warning IDs. For example the warning level for the active warning ID may be displayed block on a display device communicatively connected to the application analysis computer . In the above particular illustrative example a warning ID may be associated with version Y of application ID which may cause a notification to be displayed and the associated warning level e.g. alert version Y of application ID has warning level urgent 5 .

An alert message containing information defined based on presence of the active warning ID and or the warning level of active warning ID may be communicated block to a network node of the system . For example the alert message may be communicated block to an application retailer associated with an application server collectively referred to as the application server and or to an application developer responsible for developing the application via the data network . The alert message may contain information defined based on one of the dimensions and one of the values associated with the combination of the type of the characteristic dimension and the value that has been determined block to have changed at least the threshold amount.

The alert message may alternatively or additionally contain information based on the combination of the type of the characteristic dimension and the value for the identified statistic and the alert message can be communicated to ones of the user terminals from which reports were obtained having the combination of the type of the characteristic dimension and the value for the identified statistic. Generation of the alert message may be selectively carried out based on the counter associated with the combination of the type of the characteristic dimension and the value for the identified statistic. For example when the counter indicates that a threshold number of different user terminals have provided reports containing the type of the characteristic dimension and the value associated with the identified statistic the application analysis computer can respond by generating the alert message which can be communicated to the application server selected ones of the user terminals e.g. particular ones of the user terminals from which reports were obtained having the combination of the type of the characteristic dimension and the value for the identified statistic and or to another network node of the system .

The application server may respond to the alert message by disabling further download of a particular application program to particular ones of the user terminals that are identified based on information contained in the alert message e.g. based on the characteristic dimension and the value and or by generating a message to the particular ones of the user terminals offering an alternative version of the particular application program and or a substitute application program for replacing the particular application program. The application analysis computer may report the counter s in the alert message for use by the application server to determine whether for example a sufficient number of instances of the identified application operations e.g. problems have been identified such that a remedial action or other action should be initiated.

In the above particular illustrative example the alert message may warn the application server to cease downloading version Y of application ID and instead substitute version X of application ID. The application server may use other information within the alert message which identifies other characteristic dimensions and values identified above to cease downloading version Y or application ID only with respect to user terminals having characteristics defined by one or more of the following that may be selected by the application server and or by the application analysis computer and identified within the alert message iPad 2 Wi Fi cellular 16 MByte memory IOS 8 and AT T cellular service.

Still alternatively or additionally the application analysis computer may control block operation of selected ones of the user terminals and or selected ones of the applications responsive to the warning level for the active warning ID satisfying a control rule. For example the application analysis computer may identify particular ones of the user terminals and or a particular application based on the combination of the type of the characteristic dimensions in the value for the identified statistic. The application analysis computer can then communicate a command message s that is addressed to the identified ones of the user terminals and containing information that identifies the particular application and may further identify a problematic operation associated with the particular application and or a notification that is to be displayed to users. When the application analysis computer communicates a command message s to selected ones of the user terminals the instrument encapsulation module can responsively adapt operation of the application program based on the command such as to disable operation of the application program and or to display a message on a display device of the selected user terminals to warn users of problematic operation of the identified application.

In the above particular illustrative example the application analysis computer may select to send a command message to only ones of the user terminals having characteristics defined by one or more of the following that may be selected by the application server iPad 2 Wi Fi cellular 16 MByte memory IOS 8 application ID application version Y and AT T cellular service. The application analysis computer may use the counter associated with this combination of characteristic dimensions and values to determine when a threshold number of user terminals having this combination of characteristics has reported excessive processor utilization so that an action should be taken to control those user terminals e.g. cause the user terminals to display a notification and or to disable operation of version Y of application ID .

As explained above each report can contain a performance metric for the application program being processed by the user terminal and characteristic dimensions having values characterizing the application program and or the user terminal . The performance metrics may be generated by the reporting encapsulation module which encapsulates the application program to monitor operation of a present instance of the application program processed by the user terminal and related utilization of resources of the user terminal . The characteristic dimensions may characterize features and other characteristics of the application program and the user terminal which may be separate or independent from how a present instance of the application program is presently operating while processed by the user terminal .

Referring to the application program performs an API call block to the other application program . The reporting encapsulation module intercepts block the API call. The reporting encapsulation module forwards block the API call to the other application program which receives and processes block the API call. The other application program may communicate a response message which is intercepted and forwarded block through the reporting encapsulation module to the application program .

The reporting encapsulation module measures block performance metrics based on monitoring the API calls hardware resource utilization etc and generates block a report containing performance metrics and characteristic dimensions having values such as those described above. The report is communicated block toward the application analysis computer . The operations for measuring may be performed continuously and the operations for generating reports and communicating reports may be performed repetitively according to a defined time interval. The defined time interval may vary over time responsive to occurrence of a condition defined by a rule and or responsive to a message from the application analysis computer and or from the application server .

The application analysis computer performs operations block shown in in accordance with some embodiments. The application analysis computer may communicate an alert message to the user terminal and the user terminal may display block a notification on a display device of the user terminal based on content of the alert message and or may control operation of the application program and or the application program responsive to content of the alert message. The application analysis computer may alternatively or additionally communicate an alert message to the application server which may display block the notification on display device of the application server and or control block downloading of the application program control which version of the application program is available for downloading etc such as described above.
