Radio frequency identification RFID tags are used in various applications such as item location and or identification theft prevention data gathering etc. In some cases RF identification tags electronically store information. An RF identification tag may be powered by electromagnetic induction from an electromagnetic field produced by a tag reader or from a battery for example. Generally when excited by an electromagnetic field an RF identification tag may reply with a unique identifier and or other data from the tag.

According to the embodiments described herein RF identification tags i.e. identification tag s or tag s may be affixed to incorporated with provided on or otherwise used with product packages to sense or gather information about the packages and products associated with the packages. This information may identify whether the products or packages have been opened tampered with damaged exposed to relatively extreme environmental conditions e.g. extreme temperatures levels of humidity levels of atmospheric pressure etc. or handling e.g. sudden impact or change in velocity or acceleration weight shear or torsion stress etc. for example among other types of information. This information may be useful as an indicator of the quality state or safety of the products stored within the packages. In the context of a food supermarket for example if a tag provides an indication at the checkout that a product package for a certain product has been opened before it is purchased the purchaser may be alerted to this information and provided the opportunity to select a different product with an intact e.g. unopened sealed un tampered etc. package.

In this context illustrates a product package . In the product package is embodied as a bottle including tags and . One or both of the tags and may be integrated with or provided on the product package as a product label a product labeling wrap a tamper seal an anti theft tag etc. Among other data both tags and may store a unique identifier associated with the product package . It should be appreciated that the tags and and others described herein may be used with other types of product packages such as cartons boxes re sealable bags etc. without limitation. Further the systems and processes for tag based monitoring and evaluation described herein may be conducted with packages for any type of product including but not limited to food cleaning cosmetic electronic apparel consumer industrial manufacturing or other products without limitation. Generally while certain product packages are described and illustrated the manner of use application and incorporation of tags with such product packages is not intended to be limiting of the scope of the embodiments.

The tags and may be configured to sense or gather information related to the state of the product package and or the contents or product within the product package e.g. water milk juice etc. . The information may be sensed or gathered at one or more predetermined times periodically over time or continuously over time. The information may be stored in memory of the tags and and or communicated to another computing environment for processing. As illustrated in and described in further detail below the tag reader may read the unique identifier of the product package along with other information from one or both of the tags and . Particularly the tag reader may transmit an electromagnetic signal or field to excite actuate or direct one or both of the tags and . In turn the tags and may reply with an electromagnetic signal or field including their unique identifiers and or other information associated with the product package . In various embodiments the tags and may be excited respectively by electromagnetic fields having the same or different frequencies.

As further described below the electromagnetic signal or field from the tag reader may also direct one or both of the tags and to survey test evaluate or otherwise monitor one or more conditions of the product package and or the contents within the product package . Additionally the tag reader may transmit an electromagnetic signal to direct one or both of the tags and to reply with information related to the state of the product package and or the contents within the product package . This information may be provided to a computing environment for further processing as described below with reference to .

In the tag may be relied upon to determine whether a cap of the product package has been opened or removed. The cap is provided as one example of an access covering of the bottle . In the illustrated embodiment an antenna of the tag extends from the bottle to the cap . In other embodiments the tag may be provided on the cap and the antenna may extend from the cap to the bottle . After the bottle is filled with a product and the cap is secured to the bottle the antenna of the tag is placed to extend from the bottle to the cap . The tag and antenna may be affixed on or around the cap using adhesive tape shrink wrap a sticker etc. Additionally or alternatively the tag and antenna may be affixed on or around the cap as part of a product label a product wrap a tamper seal etc.

If the cap is removed from the bottle then the antenna may be broken away from the tag rendering the tag incapable of operation. That is if the antenna is electrically disconnected from the tag the tag can no longer be excited or actuated by electromagnetic signals or fields from the tag reader . As such the tag cannot respond to the tag reader . However even if the tag cannot respond to the tag reader the tag may still respond to the tag reader . Thus if the tag reader receives a response including the unique identifier associated with the product package from the tag but not from the tag the tag reader or another computing environment may conclude that the cap has been removed and or that the product package has been tampered with. This difference in whether both the tags and or only the tag responds to the tag reader may be considered to determine whether there is a confluence of signals from the tags and . That is if signals are confluent e.g. substantially overlapping or both occurring substantially simultaneously from both the tags and it may indicate that the cap has not been removed. On the other hand if signals are not confluent from both the tags and it may indicate that the cap has been removed.

As another example illustrates a product package . In the product package is embodied as a tub including a tag . The tag may be integrated with or provided on the product package as a product label a product labeling wrap a tamper seal an anti theft tag etc. Among other data the tag may store a unique identifier associated with the product package and product detail data associated with a product contained in the product package . The tag may be configured to sense or gather information related to the state of the product package and or the product contained in the product package e.g. butter yogurt etc. . The information may be stored in a memory of the tag and or communicated to another computing environment for processing. For example the tag reader may transmit an electromagnetic signal or field to excite the tag through the antenna . In turn the tag may reply with the unique identifier and or other information associated with the product package .

The tag may be relied upon to determine whether a lid of the product package has been opened or removed. The lid is provided as one example of an access covering of the tub . In this embodiment a continuity trace of the tag extends from the tub to the lid . The continuity trace may be affixed on or around lid using adhesive tape shrink wrap a sticker etc. Additionally or alternatively the continuity trace may be affixed on or around the lid as part of a product label a product wrap a tamper seal etc. In this case if the lid is removed from the tub then the continuity trace may be broken away from the tag .

In response to an electromagnetic signal or field from the tag reader the tag may be configured to detect or evaluate the continuity of the continuity trace or changes in the continuity of the continuity trace identify whether the lid has been opened or tampered with based on the continuity and reply to the tag reader with information i.e. data related to whether the lid has been opened or tampered with. Here the evaluation may amount to a true false determination of continuity in the continuity trace . In other words if an electrical coupling provided by the continuity trace is broken or interrupted the tag may identify that the lid has been opened or tampered with. Alternatively the tag may be configured to evaluate whether the lid has been opened or tampered with based on changes in one or more electrical characteristics of the continuity trace such as changes in continuity resistance and or capacitance for example. In contrast to the embodiment in the product package includes one tag rather than two and the tag includes the continuity trace to identify whether the lid has been removed from the tub . In this embodiment even after the lid has been removed and the continuity trace broken the tag may still respond when excited by an electromagnetic signal or field from the tag reader because the tag can reply by transmitting a signal using the antenna . Thus in response to an electromagnetic signal or field transmitted from the tag reader the tag may reply with a unique identifier and or other information associated with the product package e.g. information related to whether the lid has been opened . In turn another computing device or system in addition to or other than the tag may gather and process this information to provide various types of feedback as further described below. In certain embodiments the tag may be configured to evaluate the continuity of the continuity trace or changes in such continuity before the tag is excited by an electromagnetic signal from the tag reader . In this case the tag may store the result of the evaluation in a memory of the tag and relay the result once excited by the electromagnetic signal.

In other aspects of the embodiments described herein a tag may be configured to identify a date or timing e.g. absolute or relative timing time of day calendar day month year etc. at which a product or product package was first opened. The tag may use this timing information to calculate a use by or expiration date associated with the product based on when the product was first opened. In this context the tag may be further configured to provide a display of this use by or expiration date so that an individual can decide when to discard the product. Further a tag may include one or more sensors such as temperature humidity and or movement sensors and the tag may rely upon the sensors to monitor and evaluate the status or characteristics of a product package or product over time. Such information may be displayed by the tag or sensed or gathered by a tag reader evaluated by a computing environment and used to provide certain feedback. These and other aspects are described in further detail below.

Similar to the embodiments described above with reference to the tag may be relied upon to determine whether the product package has been opened. In this embodiment a continuity trace of the tag extends out and across a perforated access edge of the product package . If the perforated access edge is removed e.g. torn off or away from the product package then the continuity trace may be broken away from the tag . In response to an electromagnetic signal or field from the tag reader the tag may be configured to evaluate the continuity of the continuity trace and identify whether the perforated access edge has been wholly or partly removed or tampered with. In other words if an electrical coupling provided by the continuity trace is broken or interrupted the tag may identify that the perforated access edge has been opened or tampered with. In response to an electromagnetic signal or field from the tag reader tag may reply to the tag reader with information i.e. data related to whether the perforated access edge has been removed from the product package . In turn another computing device or system in addition to or other than the tag may gather and process this information to provide various types of feedback as further described below.

The tag also includes a continuity trace incorporated with a re sealable strip of the product package . When the re sealable strip is opened then the continuity trace is also opened i.e. continuity is broken . In other words if an electrical coupling provided by the continuity trace is open broken or interrupted the tag may identify that the re sealable strip has been opened. When the re sealable strip is closed then the continuity trace is also closed i.e. continuity is re established and the tag may identify that the re sealable strip has been re closed. Thus the tag may be configured to evaluate changes in the continuity of the continuity trace over time to identify a number of times in which the re sealable strip has been opened and or closed the length of time during which the re sealable strip has been left open etc. In response to an electromagnetic signal or field from the tag reader tag may reply to the tag reader with information i.e. data related to whether the re sealable strip is or has been opened or a number of times the re sealable strip has been opened for example. In turn another computing device or system in addition to or other than the tag may gather and process this information to provide various types of feedback as further described below.

Here it is noted that the ways in which the tags and are incorporated with the product packages and in are provided by way of example. Among embodiments tags may be incorporated with product packages in various ways. That is depending upon the type of the product package the number of access openings to the product package the type size and orientation of the access openings etc. tags may be incorporated with provided on or applied to product packages in various ways to reliably detect opening or tampering. For example various lengths and orientations of continuity traces may be relied upon depending upon the type of product package. Similarly the number and type of sensors in a tag may vary depending upon the type of product package the type of product contained in the product package the type of information that is to be sensed or gathered about the product and or the product package etc.

The tag processor may be embodied as a state machine general or specific purpose processor or processing circuit configured to direct the operations of the tag . In some embodiments the tag processor includes a clock . The clock may be relied upon by the tag processor to track and identify a time and or date at which certain events occur. The charge store may be embodied as any suitable electric charge storage element such as a capacitor or battery for example. The charge store may provide power for the operation of the tag over time.

The RF front end may be embodied as any suitable combination of front end circuitry elements for RF communications including but not limited to one or more amplifiers phase locked loops mixers filters slicers etc. The RF front end may be configured and or tuned to operate at one or more frequencies or frequency ranges such as 125 kHz 134.2 kHz 13.56 MHz 860 MHz 960 MHz or 2.45 GHz for example. Thus the RF front end may be excited and configured to receive data from transmit data to or receive and transmit data with the tag reader at such frequencies or frequency ranges using the antenna . Further the tag reader may excite the tag by an electromagnetic signal or field and in turn induce a potential difference in the antenna . The RF front end may capture electric charge associated with this potential difference and provide it to the charge store . In this way the charge store may be recharged through the RF front end by the tag reader . In embodiments of the tag which omit the charge store electric charge captured by the RF front end may directly provide power for the operation of the tag . In this case the tag may operate only when excited by the tag reader .

The sensors may include sensors and or related circuitry configured to detect temperature humidity movement acceleration orientation location etc. In this context the sensors may include one or more thermometers hygrometers accelerometers gyroscopes global positioning system GPS sensors etc. embodied in one or more nano or micro electromechanical system NEMS or MEMS devices and or circuitry.

The sensors may also include the continuity trace or multiple continuity traces . It should be appreciated however that the continuity trace may be incorporated with the tag as a component distinct from the sensors . For example the continuity trace may be electrically coupled to the tag processor or integrated as part of the antenna . The continuity trace may be incorporated into a product package in order to identity whether the product package has been opened or tampered with. In the continuity trace extends across an example access opening of a product package. The continuity trace may be embodied as a fine or thin conductive trace or filament which may be broken relatively easily under mechanical stress. The continuity trace may be formed from any suitable conductive or semi conductive material including metals semiconductor materials etc. In some embodiments the continuity trace may be formed from a material which exhibits a piezoresistive effect i.e. change in resistance due to changes in mechanical stress. The tag may test for continuity lack of continuity or other changes in electrical characteristics e.g. changes in continuity resistance capacitance inductance etc. in the continuity trace to identity whether a product package has been opened or tampered with. For example the lack of continuity in the continuity trace may indicate some likelihood that it has been broken due to opening the access opening . In contrast continuity in the continuity trace may indicate that the access opening has not been opened.

In some embodiments the tag may be also configured to evaluate the electrical characteristics of the antenna as a measure or indicator of the manipulation of a product package. For example the antenna may be provided over a vacuum sealed cap of a bottle or other container. Once the vacuum sealed cap has been removed the vacuum within the container may be broken and the vacuum sealed cap may pop or deform partly in shape. This deformation or change in shape may cause the electrical characteristics of the antenna to change because of varied mechanical stress on the antenna for example. In turn the tag may detect this change in electrical characteristics to identify that the bottle has been opened.

The display may be embodied as any suitable type of display device including associated circuitry. In preferred embodiments the display may be embodied as an electronic ink type display for reduced power consumption. In other embodiments the display may be embodied as a liquid crystal display LCD light emitting diode LED or organic light emitting diode OLED display for example. As further described below the tag may direct the display to visually present information such as a timing or date upon which a product package was opened or a use by date associated with a product within the product package among other information. In various embodiments the display may be integrated with or separate from the tag .

The tag memory may be embodied as any suitable type of memory device or circuitry. The tag memory may store data for the tag including but not limited to a unique identifier product detail data and product usage data . The unique identifier may be embodied as any type of unique data identifier that provides a one to one correspondence between the tag and an associated product package. The unique identifier may be globally unique such as a serial number of the tag or may correspond to a stock keeping unit SKU number for a product or product package a universal product code UPC number for a product or other identifier. The product detail data may include information related to a product or product package such as a product name or type product trade name or mark or product characteristics. The product characteristics may include nutritional information product disposal or usage information recommended or required storage condition information e.g. temperature humidity etc. current storage condition information volume or weight information etc. In some embodiments the product characteristics may include use by sell by or other product expiration information. The product usage data may include information related to whether a product package has been opened the number of times the product package has been opened a remaining amount of product within the product package a timing associated with an expiration of the product etc. Additional examples of the unique identifier the product detail data the product usage data and the manner in which such information is used for tag based monitoring and evaluation is described below.

As described above the unique identifier may include any type of unique data identifier that provides a one to one correspondence between the tag and the product package or the product within the product package . The unique identifier may be globally unique such as a serial number of the tag or may correspond to a stock keeping unit SKU number for the product package a universal product code UPC number for a product within the product package or other identifier.

The product detail data may include information related to the product package or a product within the product package such as a product name or type product trade name or mark or product characteristics. The product characteristics may include nutritional information product disposal or usage information recommended or required storage condition information e.g. temperature humidity etc. current storage condition information volume or weight information etc. In some embodiments the product characteristics may include use by sell by or other product expiration information. The product usage data may include information related to whether the product package has been opened the number of times the product package has been opened a remaining amount of product within the product package a timing associated with an expiration of the product etc. For example the product usage data may include a continuity status indicator as to whether the continuity trace has been broken. That is the product usage data may include a status indicator as to whether the lid of the product package has been opened or tampered with based on the continuity lack of continuity or other electrical characteristic of the continuity trace . Further the product usage data may include a timing at which the continuity of the trace was been broken.

It should be appreciated that the diagram in is provided by way of example. In other embodiments the type order and or timing of signals and data may vary from that illustrated. For example one or more of the unique identifier the product detail data or the product usage data may be omitted from the signals communicated by the tag to the tag reader . Further one or more of the unique identifier the product detail data or the product usage data may be repeated over time while the electromagnetic field is provided by the tag reader .

In some embodiments one or more tags such as those illustrated in C and may be used in a larger system for tag based product monitoring and evaluation. In such a system information about products and or product packages may be sensed gathered monitored and evaluated over time. For example in the setting of a retail store or fulfillment center where tags have been incorporated into product packages as described herein the tags may be interrogated using a tag reader to identify whether the product packages have been opened or tampered with whether the associated products have expired or whether the products have or may have spoiled been damaged or used. In this context a description of a system for tag based product monitoring and evaluation is provided below followed by a discussion of the operation of the same.

The computing environment may be geographically located together with or apart from the electronic commerce platform the client device and the product packages and . In other words in various embodiments the product packages and may be located at a fulfillment center a brick and mortar store a residence e.g. in a pantry refrigerator etc. at other locations or distributed among various locations and the computing environment may be located apart from the product packages and . In this case so long as one or more tag readers similar to the tag reader are located proximate to the product packages and information may be collected from the tags and and relayed to the computing environment via the network . Thus it should be appreciated that in one embodiment the tag reader may be coupled to the computing environment by way of the network .

The computing environment may be embodied as a computer computing device or computing system. In certain embodiments the computing environment may include one or more computing devices arranged for example in one or more server or computer banks. The computing device or devices may be located at a single installation site or distributed among different geographical locations. As further described below in connection with the computing environment may include a plurality of computing devices that together embody a hosted computing resource a grid computing resource and or other distributed computing arrangement. In some cases the computing environment may be embodied as an elastic computing resource where an allotted capacity of processing network storage or other computing related resources varies over time. The computing environment may also be embodied in part as various functional e.g. computer readable instruction and or logic e.g. device circuit or processing circuit elements that direct the computing environment to perform aspects of the embodiments described herein.

The computing environment may be configured to instruct the tag reader to transmit an electromagnetic signal or field to excite activate and or interrogate the tags and among other tags. As discussed above tags and may reply with information stored on the tags and such as unique identifiers product detail and product usage data for example. Based on the reply from the tags and the computing environment may be configured to identify products associated with the tags and . According to other aspects of the embodiments the computing environment may identify whether one or both of the product packages and have been opened with reference to the unique identifiers and or product usage data received from the tags and .

The tag audit logic of the computing environment may be configured to direct the tag reader to interrogate the tags and at one or more predetermined times periodically over time or continuously over time. Referring to data returned from the tags and in response to the interrogation see e.g. the tag audit logic may be configured to evaluate various aspects of the product packages and and or the products contained within the product packages and . For example the tag audit logic may be configured to identify the tags and the product packages and and or products associated with the product packages and and store this information in the product data store . Further the tamper identifier may be configured to determine whether one or both of the product packages and have been opened or tampered with and store this information in the product detail data store . In this context the tamper identifier may review certain product detail or usage data returned from the tags and in response to an interrogation. One or more data fields within the product detail or usage data may identify that a product package has been opened or tampered with along with a timing at which the product package was opened or tampered with.

The expiration monitor may be configured to identify or calculate one or more dates or timings upon which the products in the product packages and are set to expire. In this context the expiration monitor may identify an expiration date based on product detail data returned from the tags and in response to an interrogation. The product detail data may include an absolute e.g. expiration on Jan. 1 2014 or relative expiration date e.g. expiration 10 days after opening for one or both of the products in the product packages and and the expiration monitor may be configured to identify and store such information in the product detail data store . In other aspects of the embodiments the expiration monitor may calculate timings at which the products in the product packages and will expire based on product detail data for the products and timings at which the product packages and were opened. In this case with reference to product detail data received from the tag the expiration monitor may identify that the product in the product package expires 10 days after opening and calculate an expiration date for the product based on a timing at which the product package was opened. In other aspects the expiration monitor may identify that the product in the product package has expired because a temperature data field in the product detail data indicates that the temperature of the product or the product package has remained outside its recommended storage temperature for an extended period of time.

The product usage monitor may be configured to evaluate the product detail and or usage data received from the tags and to determine product usage information such as a number of times the product packages and have been accessed moved etc. This product usage information may be stored in the product usage data store .

The feedback generator may be configured to review and process the data stored in the data store to prepare feedback for review by individuals. The feedback may be presented in various forms such as one or more lists reports charts etc. As one type of feedback the feedback generator may be configured to generate a list of products that are expired and forward the list to an individual. The individual may access such list in the form of a network page or e mail using the client device for example. As other types of feedback the feedback generator may generate a list of products within a certain area such as a refrigerator or pantry a list of products that will expire within a certain period of time a list of products that have been opened or tampered with a list of products that have not been opened a list of products that are relatively old a list of products that are close to being used up etc.

In some embodiments the feedback generator may reference information stored by the electronic commerce platform when generating feedback. For example the electronic commerce platform may store a list of items regularly purchased by one or more individuals. The feedback generator may compare a list of items identified using the tags and and others with those items commonly purchased by the one or more individuals to make suggestions on items to purchase. Additionally or alternatively the feedback generator may automatically place an order for one or more products when it identifies that certain products are expired or are about to expire. In this way the computing environment may save time and effort.

The network may include the Internet intranets extranets wide area networks WANs local area networks LANs wired networks wireless networks cable networks satellite networks other suitable networks or any combinations thereof. It is noted that the computing environment may communicate with the client device over various protocols such as hypertext transfer protocol HTTP simple object access protocol SOAP representational state transfer REST real time transport protocol RTP real time streaming protocol RTSP real time messaging protocol RTMP user datagram protocol UDP internet protocol IP transmission control protocol TCP and or other protocols for communicating data over the network without limitation.

The electronic commerce platform may be embodied as a computer computing device or computing system that operates as one or more electronic commerce platforms for selling goods or services. In certain embodiments the electronic commerce platform may be similar in composition to the computing environment including one or more computing devices arranged for example in one or more server or computer banks. In various embodiments the computing environment may access the electronic commerce platform by way of the network or the electronic commerce platform may be integrated with the computing environment .

The client device is representative of one or a plurality of client devices of one or more users. The client device may be embodied as any computing device or system including but not limited to those embodied in the form of a desktop computer a laptop computer a personal digital assistant a wearable computing device a cellular telephone a set top box a music or media player or a tablet computer among other example computing devices and systems. The client device may also include various peripheral devices for example. In this context the peripheral devices may include input devices such as for example a keyboard keypad touch pad touch screen microphone scanner mouse joystick camera or one or more buttons etc. The peripheral devices may also include a display indicator lights speakers etc. depending upon the primary use of the client device .

In one embodiment the client application may be embodied as a browser application that interacts with the computing environment via the network . To this end the client application may be embodied as for example a commercially available hypertext based internet browser such as Internet Explorer Firefox Chrome Silk or other browser or variant thereof without limitation. Alternatively the client application may be embodied as one or more other applications that interact with the computing environment using a suitable protocol via the network . Generally when executed in the client device the client application renders a webpage or similar user interface on a display of the client device .

As illustrated in the process includes evaluating access to a covering or access opening of the product package at reference numeral . In this context as described above with reference to the tag may be configured to evaluate the continuity of the continuity trace and identify whether the lid has been opened or tampered with based on the continuity. In other words if an electrical coupling provided by the continuity trace is broken or interrupted the tag may identify that the lid has been opened or tampered with. At reference numeral the process includes evaluating a condition of the product in the product package . In this context as described above the tag may include one or more sensors such as temperature humidity and or movement sensors for example and the tag may use these sensors to evaluate the status or characteristics of the product and or the product package .

At reference numerals and the process includes storing the product usage and or detail data sensed or gathered at reference numerals and in a memory of the tag . For example based on the evaluation performed at reference numeral the process may include storing a status indicator as to whether the lid has been opened or tampered with as product usage data. A timing at which the lid was opened or tampered with may also be stored by referencing clock for example. Further based on the evaluation performed at reference numeral the process may include storing various characteristics of the product in the product package such as the temperature of the product or the product package along with a timing at which the temperature was taken for example.

At reference numerals and the process includes calculating and storing an expiration and or use by date for the product in the product package . In this context a processor of the tag e.g. similar to the tag processor in may identify the expiration or use by date based on product detail data stored in the tag and a timing at which the lid was opened. The product detail data may include a relative expiration date e.g. 10 days after opening for the product in the product package and the processor of the tag may be configured to calculate a timing at which the product in the product package will expire based on the product detail data and the timing at which the product package was opened. In this case with reference to product detail data received from the tag the expiration monitor may identify that the product in the product package expires 10 days after opening and calculate an expiration date for the product based on a timing at which the product package was opened. Similarly the tag may be configured to calculate use by date based the on product detail data and the timing at which the product package was opened.

At reference numeral the process includes displaying certain product detail or usage information on a display of the tag . For example as described above with reference to . The tag may include a display which is electrically coupled to the tag . Thus the tag may provide product detail or usage information on the display at reference numeral . The information may include the expiration date information calculated at reference numeral sell by date information as illustrated in or opened on and or use by date information as illustrated in for example.

At reference numeral the process includes the computing environment interrogating the tag . As noted above the computing environment may direct the tag reader to interrogate the tag and or any other tags at one or more predetermined times periodically over time or continuously over time. In response at reference numeral the process includes the tag transmitting a unique identifier for the product package product detail data associated with the product in the product package and or product usage data associated with the product in the product package . In this product usage and detail data among other data fields the tag may transmit a status indicator as to whether the lid of the product package has been opened a timing at which the lid was opened a temperature of the product or the product package etc. At reference numeral the process includes the computing environment evaluating the data transmitted by the tag .

As described above the product package includes the tags and . The antenna of the tag extends from the bottle to the cap . At reference numeral the process includes the computing environment interrogating the tags and . As noted above the computing environment may direct the tag reader to interrogate the tags and at one or more predetermined times periodically over time or continuously over time. At reference numeral the process includes the tag transmitting a unique identifier for the product package to the tag reader . Further at reference numeral the process includes the tag transmitting a unique identifier for the product package product detail data associated with the product in the product package and or product usage data associated with the product in the product package . At reference numeral the process includes the computing environment evaluating the data transmitted by the tags and at reference numerals and .

At some time after reference numeral the product package is opened. For example the cap may be removed from the bottle . In the case that the cap is removed from the bottle then the antenna of the tag may be broken away from the tag as described above rendering the tag incapable of operation. That is if the antenna is electrically disconnected from the tag the tag can no longer be interrogated or excited by electromagnetic signals or fields from the tag reader . As such the tag cannot respond to the tag reader .

Later in time at reference numeral the process includes the computing environment interrogating the tags and again. However at reference numeral the tag responds but the tag does not. At reference numeral the process includes the computing environment evaluating the data transmitted by the tag at reference numeral . At reference numeral the tamper identifier of the computing environment may determine that the cap of the bottle has been removed because the tag did not respond to the interrogation at reference numeral . In other words the tamper identifier may be configured to conclude that the cap has been removed and or that the product package has been tampered with if the tag reader receives a unique identifier from the tag but not from the tag .

At reference numeral the process includes the computing environment interrogating the tags and . As noted above the computing environment may direct the tag reader to interrogate the tags and at one or more predetermined times periodically over time or continuously over time. At reference numeral the process includes one or both of the tags and transmitting unique identifiers for the product packages and product detail data associated with the products in the product packages and and or product usage data associated with the products in the product packages and . It should be appreciated that the product detail and usage data transmitted at reference numeral may have been previously sensed or gathered by the tags and during a process similar to the process described above with reference to . Finally at reference numeral the process includes evaluating the data transmitted by the tags and at reference numeral . More particularly at reference numeral the computing environment may evaluate the data during the process described below with reference to .

In it may be assumed that the computing environment has received from one or more tags one or more unique identifiers product detail data associated with products in product packages and or product usage data associated with the products in the product packages. At reference numeral the process includes evaluating the product packages with reference to the unique identifiers the product detail data and or the product usage data. For example with reference to the unique identifiers the product detail data and or the product usage data the computing environment may be configured to identify one or more products or product packages. Additionally the computing environment may identify whether one or more of the product packages have been opened with reference to confluence in unique identifiers or other signals from tags and or based on status indicator fields in product usage data as described herein.

The product usage data may include information related to whether a product package has been opened the number of times the product package has been opened a remaining amount of product within the product package a timing associated with an expiration of the product etc. For example the product usage data may include a continuity status indicator which identifies whether a continuity trace of a tag associated with a product package has been broken. Further the product usage data may include a timing at which the continuity of the trace was been broken. All of these aspects and others may be evaluated by the computing environment at reference numeral .

At reference numeral the process includes evaluating the products in the product packages with reference to the product detail data and or the product usage data. For example the computing environment may evaluate the product detail data to identify information related to a product within a product package such as a product name or type product trade name or mark or product characteristics. The product characteristics may include nutritional information product disposal or usage information recommended or required storage condition information e.g. temperature humidity etc. current storage condition information volume or weight information etc. In some embodiments the product characteristics may include use by sell by or other product expiration information. All of these aspects and others may be evaluated by the computing environment at reference numeral .

At reference numerals and the process includes storing in the data store the evaluations generated and data collected at reference numerals and . For example based on the evaluation performed at reference numeral the process may include storing a status indicator as to whether access openings of one or more packages have been opened or tampered with. A timing at which individual ones of the access openings were opened or tampered with may also be stored. Further based on the evaluation performed at reference numeral the process may include storing various characteristics of products such as product temperatures etc.

At reference numerals and the process includes calculating and storing one or more expiration and or use by dates for various products. That is based on the product detail and or usage data received by the computing environment the expiration monitor and or the product usage monitor may be configured to identify or calculate one or more dates or timings upon which products are set to expire at reference numeral . The expiration monitor and or the product usage monitor may identify an expiration date based on the product detail data received from one or more tags. The product detail data may include an absolute e.g. expiration on Jan. 1 2014 or relative expiration date e.g. expiration 10 days after opening for certain products. The expiration monitor and or the product usage monitor may also be configured to calculate one or more timings at which products will expire based on the product detail data for the products and the timings at which the product packages for the products were opened. In this case with reference to product detail data the expiration monitor and or the product usage monitor may identify that a product expires 10 days after it was opened and calculate an expiration date for the product based on the timing at which it was opened. Similarly the expiration monitor and or the product usage monitor may be configured to calculate one or more use by dates for various products based the on product detail data and the timing at which product packages were opened. In other aspects the expiration monitor and or the product usage monitor may identify that a product has expired because a temperature data field associated with the product indicates that the temperature of the product or product package has remained outside its recommended storage temperature for an extended period of time.

At reference numeral the process includes generating feedback related to the product packages and or products evaluated at reference numerals and and the calculations performed at reference numerals and . As one example the feedback may identify whether product packages have been opened a timing at which the product packages have been opened and an indication as to whether products are expired. In this context the feedback generator of the computing environment may be configured to review and process the data stored in the data store to prepare feedback for review by individuals. The feedback may be presented in various forms such as one or more lists reports charts etc. As one type of feedback the feedback generator may be configured to generate a list of products that are expired and forward the list to an individual. The individual may access such list in the form of a network page or e mail using the client device for example. As other types of feedback the feedback generator may generate a list of products within a certain area such as a refrigerator or pantry a list of products that will expire within a certain period of time a list of products that have been opened or tampered with a list of products that have not been opened a list of products that are relatively old a list of products that are close to being used up etc.
