To change the security level the first electronic device can also apply the security function of one or more secondary electronic devices connected through the network communication. When changing the security level at the point of an active mode e.g. the turn on of the display module the first electronic device receives security level from the one or more connected secondary electronic devices . The secondary electronic device can be a wearable electronic device. When the secondary electronic device is worn the first electronic device checks the wearing status and determines whether the wearing status information satisfies the condition which defines the security level. The first electronic device obtains the wearing status information of the secondary electronic device through one or more sensors attached. The first electronic device receives the wearing status information from the secondary electronic device and determine whether the use of the first electronic device is authorized based on the wearing status information. When the display module is turned on and the wearing status information received from the secondary electronic device is the status information approving the use of the first electronic device the first electronic device provides the menu for changing its security level such as password input region.

When the password corresponding to the first user is input correctly the first electronic device may change the first user profile security level.

When the password of the second user or an incorrect password is input to the password input region while the secondary electronic device is worn by the first user the first electronic device does not allow a change of the security level by the user and changes the security level to the highest level for limiting the first electronic device . When the wearing status information received from the secondary electronic device indicates that the secondary electronic device is not being worn or the user profile is not designated e.g. incorrect wearing the first electronic device does not provide a password input region for changing the security level and changes the security level to the highest level which may be done automatically.

While the first electronic device can determine the user profile based on the wearing status information received from the secondary electronic device the first electronic device may receive the user profile determined based on the wearing status information from the secondary electronic device and set the user environment based on the user profile. When the secondary electronic device sends the user profile to the first electronic device and shares the same user information with the first electronic device the secondary electronic device may send an identification code indicative of the user profile as the user profile. When the secondary electronic device sends the user profile including additional information which is not included in the first electronic device the user profile can include a preset protocol data for the first electronic device and the first electronic device applies the received information.

Referring to the secondary electronic device can be a device attached to a strap such as wrist watch.

To determine the wearing status of the secondary electronic device when the secondary electronic device is the wrist watch the buckle tongue and the holes can be connected to a main body of the secondary electronic device using a conducting wire mounted at a preset location of the strap. When the hole or of the strap of the secondary electronic device is fastened to the tongue it can be designed to flow a preset current quantity a preset resistance of the hole through the hole or to generate a preset connection signal e.g. an electromagnetic signal and detect the fastened buckle through a module e.g. a module for detecting the connection through resistance or a ground GND component for detecting whether the buckle is correctly fastened. After determining the connection through the module a dual structure may determine the connection status of the tongue and the hole. When the tongue is fastened to one hole the secondary electronic device obtains the wearing status information from the current quantity or the connection signal of the hole. The secondary electronic device sends the wearing status information to the first electronic device and the first electronic device determines the user of the secondary electronic device based on the obtained wearing status information. The secondary electronic device determines the user profile based on the obtained wearing status information. For example when the tongue is fastened to the hole of the strap the secondary electronic device retrieves the preset user information from its database based on the acquired current quantity or connection signal. When the obtained current quantity or connection signal satisfies first user information the secondary electronic device sends the first user profile to the first electronic device . Further the secondary electronic device may retrieve the preset user information with the obtained current quantity or connection signal or sensor information obtained by one or more sensors. Even when the tongue and the hole of the strap are fastened the secondary electronic device can obtain its temperature or an object temperature through a temperature sensor. When the obtained temperature corresponds to a preset temperature range of an external electronic device the secondary electronic device determines the user information corresponding to the obtained current quantity or connection signal.

The first electronic device receives the wearing status information or the user profile determined based on the wearing status information from the secondary electronic device . Upon receiving the wearing status information the first electronic device determines the user profile including the wearing status information in its database based on the wearing status information. The first electronic device determines its security level according to the user profile and provides a function according to the security level. For example for the first user profile the first electronic device provides a menu for inputting a password when the display module is turned on and may lower the security level when the correct password is input. When the preset user information is not input the first electronic device detects the input for turning on the display module at the security level which locks the first electronic device and receives the first user profile from the connected secondary electronic device when the display module is turned on. The first electronic device provides a menu for inputting the password according to the first user profile received. When the correct password is input the first electronic device releases the lock function and provides the security level function e.g. change the security level corresponding to the first user profile. When an incorrect password is input the first electronic device stays in the lock mode and prevents access by the first user.

When the correct password is input and the wearing status of the secondary electronic device is changed or the network communication remains connected to the first electronic device at the security level corresponding to the user information the first electronic device maintain the current security level though the display module is turned off.

When the network communication is disconnected from the secondary electronic device the data transmission falls below a preset level or the correct buckle connection is not detected due to the damaged strap of the secondary electronic device or the damaged secondary electronic device the first electronic device changes its security level to the original security level or a higher security level through the password input.

Referring to the secondary electronic device can include a module or for detecting a tongue of the buckle fitting into a hole or of the strap at a preset location based on the hole. For example when the buckle tongue is fastened to one e.g. the hole connected to the module of the one or more holes of the strap the module sends a preset signal of the hole to the main body of the secondary electronic device through a preset conducting wire of the strap. The secondary electronic device determines the security level corresponding to the preset signal obtained by the module and sends the security level to the first electronic device connected via the network communication. The first electronic device controls its content security level based on the obtained security level.

Referring to besides the information obtained from the connection of the buckle tongue and the hole the secondary electronic device can obtain its wearing status information through one or more sensors connected.

That is when the hat including the secondary electronic device is worn the first electronic device determines the user profile corresponding to the connection of the preset region of the first band and the first region the second region or the third region of the second band and based on the wearing status information. Alternatively when the hat is worn the secondary electronic device sends to the first electronic device the determined user profile corresponding to the connection of the preset region of the first band and the first region the second region or the third region of the second band and based on the wearing status information.

Based on the wearing status information of the secondary electronic device connected via the network communication the first electronic device is able to control its security level change. When the wearing status information of the secondary electronic device corresponds to the user authorized to control the security level of the first electronic device the first electronic device is able to change its security level according to a security level change command input. When changing the security level according to the input command the first electronic device is able to limit the change of the security level based on the security level corresponding to the user profile determined by the wearing status information of the secondary electronic device .

Referring to the secondary electronic device can be a wearable device including a band for adjusting the size according to the tension or a device attached to wearable clothes shoes hats gloves or accessories. When the secondary electronic device is attached to clothes a wristband of the clothes can adjust its size using the tension from the part of the body passing through the wristband . In the secondary electronic device attached to the clothes including the wristband size adjusted by the tension the secondary electronic device can be designed to flow the current or to issue the connection signal so as to measure a value corresponding to the preset tension of the wristband . The secondary electronic device obtains the wearing status information from the current quantity or the connection signal corresponding to the tension of the wristband and one or more sensors attached to the clothes. The secondary electronic device obtains the wearing status information from one or more sensors for checking the wearing status of the clothes such as a proximity sensor a touch sensor and a temperature sensor.

When the secondary electronic device is attached to the eyeglasses the secondary electronic device obtains the wearing status information of the eyeglasses from a tension sensor for measuring the tension applied to a frame of the eyeglasses being worn and a temperature sensor attached to a preset location e.g. at the temples or a bridge or of the eyeglass frame.

The first electronic device or the secondary electronic device determines the user profile based on the obtained wearing status information. For example the first electronic device determines the user profile satisfying the tension value obtained by the tension sensor and the temperature measured by the temperature sensor by referring to the wearing status information of the secondary electronic device . For example the secondary electronic device provides the determined user profile to the first electronic device and reinforces the security of the first electronic device .

The first electronic device provides a security environment corresponding to the determined user profile. The first electronic device can display a service based on the security level corresponding to the user profile determined based on the wearing status information when the display module is turned on. For example the first electronic device can display a lock screen of the determined security level on the display module and release the lock screen according to a user s input. The first electronic device is able to change the security level by releasing the lock screen. When the wearing status information of the secondary electronic device stays below a preset value or an error range the security level of the first electronic device is maintained. For example the first electronic device provides a menu for inputting a password or a pattern to change the security level on the screen when the display module is turned on and changes the security environment at the preset security level by receiving an input of the correct password or pattern. When the display module of the first electronic device is turned off the first electronic device returns to the original security level prior to input of the password or pattern. In this case at the security level of the user profile determined based on the wearing status information of the connected secondary electronic device the first electronic device changes its security level according to the authority based on the wearing status information of the secondary electronic device . When the wearing status of the secondary electronic device does not change and the display module of the first electronic device is turned off the first electronic device maintains the lock release e.g. the changed security level without changing the security level according to the setting.

At the security level of the user profile determined based on the wearing status information of the secondary electronic device connected when the wearing status information of the secondary electronic device is switched to the wear release or the wearing status of the secondary electronic device is changed for example when the first electronic device and the secondary electronic device are disconnected e.g. the disconnection of the network communication the security level of the first electronic device can be changed to the security level before the lock release or to the preset security level e.g. the highest security level .

Alternatively the first electronic device can notify a user of the wearing status information of the secondary electronic device by displaying the wearing status change information of the secondary electronic device through the display module outputting the sound indicative of the wearing status change through a speaker or vibrating in a preset pattern.

The first electronic device is able to control its security level based on the wearing status information or the user profile received from the secondary electronic device .

In step the first electronic device determines whether the wearing status information obtained by the wearable secondary electronic device connected via the network communication satisfies a preset condition. For example the secondary electronic device obtains the wearing status information through one or more sensors. The first electronic device or the secondary electronic device determines whether the obtained wearing status information satisfies one or more preset conditions for controlling the security level in the security environment of the first electronic device . If the obtained wearing status information satisfies one or more preset conditions for controlling the security level then the electronic device proceeds to step . If one or more preset conditions for controlling the security level is not satisfied then the process ends.

In step the first electronic device determines the security level according to the condition satisfied by the wearing status information of the secondary electronic device . The first electronic device determines whether the wearing status information of the secondary electronic device satisfies one or more security levels of the first electronic device and provides the user environment at the determined security level.

The first electronic device checks the authority for providing the user environment at the security level determined by the secondary electronic device . For example the first electronic device receives an identification code such as a password or pattern for accessing the user environment at the security level. When the input identification code is correct the first electronic device provides the authorized user environment at the security level.

In step the first electronic device or the secondary electronic device determines whether the wearing status of the secondary electronic device is changed during the operation of the first electronic device according to the authorized security level. For example when the preset condition is or is not satisfied at the preset location such as buckle pin or hole or tension sensor the secondary electronic device sends to the first electronic device the changed wearing status information or the security level determined based on the wearing status information. Alternatively the first electronic device detects an error e.g. disconnection of the data transmission reception of the network communication with the secondary electronic device during its operation according to the granted authority of the determined security level.

When detecting a change of the wearing status information or the network communication of the secondary electronic device the first electronic device proceeds to step . Otherwise the first electronic device proceeds to step .

In step when the wearing status of the secondary electronic device does not change the first electronic device maintains the current security level and security environment during the operation at the determined security level. For example when the display module is turned off the first electronic device maintains the security release according to the setting which controls to change the security level of the security release the security status of the first electronic device with the granted authority to the security level of the lock without locking the security level.

In step the first electronic device resets the security level. When detecting the changed wearing status of the secondary electronic device at the current security level e.g. the security level of the first electronic device with the authority authorized according to the identification code the first electronic device changes its security level. For example when the secondary electronic device is taken off while at a low security level according to the identification code the first electronic device changes the security level to the highest security level. When changing the security level to the highest security level the first electronic device may output information indicating that the secondary electronic device has been taken off.

The first electronic device is able to control its security level based on the wearing status information or the user profile received from the secondary electronic device .

In step the first electronic device determines whether the wearing status information obtained by the wearable secondary electronic device connected via the network communication satisfies the preset condition. For example the secondary electronic device obtains its wearing status information through one or more sensors. The first electronic device or the secondary electronic device determines whether the obtained wearing status information satisfies one or more preset conditions for controlling the security level in the security environment of the first electronic device . The preset condition can be satisfied by determining the user profile meeting the obtained wearing status information among one or more user profiles recorded to the first electronic device or the secondary electronic device . If the obtained wearing status information satisfies one or more preset conditions for controlling the security level then the electronic device proceeds to step . If one or more preset conditions for controlling the security level is not satisfied then the process ends.

In step the first electronic device provides an operation according to the security level of the determined user profile. The first electronic device and the secondary electronic device can share one or more same user profiles. When the user profile determined by the wearing status information of the secondary electronic device is absent in the first electronic device the secondary electronic device sends to the first electronic device the security level of the determined user profile and the information for providing the security environment corresponding to the user profile via an instruction prearranged with the first electronic device . The first electronic device confirms the user profile determined by the secondary electronic device . For example the first electronic device receives an identification code such as a password or pattern for accessing the user environment of the first electronic device provided at the security level of the user profile. Alternatively the first electronic device receives information for automatically controlling the security level according to the user profile determined by the secondary electronic device .

In step when the input identification code is correct the first electronic device changes the security level according to the granted authority of the user profile. For example when receiving the user profile from the secondary electronic device the first electronic device provides the user environment at the security level according to the received user profile.

In step the first electronic device or the secondary electronic device determines whether the wearing status of the secondary electronic device is changed during the operation of the first electronic device according to the authorized user profile. For example when the connection of the sensor or the device providing the information to determine the user profile according to the preset location such as buckle pin or hole or tension sensor the secondary electronic device sends the change information to the first electronic device . Alternatively the first electronic device detects an error e.g. disconnection of the data transmission reception of the network communication with the secondary electronic device during its operation of the first electronic device according to the granted authority of the determined security level.

When detecting a change of the wearing status information or the network communication of the secondary electronic device the first electronic device proceeds to step . Otherwise the first electronic device proceeds to step .

In step the first electronic device resets the security level. When detecting the changed wearing status of the secondary electronic device at the current security level e.g. the security level of the first electronic device with the authority granted based on the identification code the first electronic device changes its security level. For example when the secondary electronic device is taken off while at a low security level according to the identification code the first electronic device changes the security level to the highest security level. When changing the security level to the highest security level the first electronic device may output the information indicating that the secondary electronic device has been taken off. When the first electronic device outputs the information indicating that the secondary electronic device is taken off and the secondary electronic device is put on again according to the wearing status information within a preset time the first electronic device operates under the granted authority of the user profile with the identification code input at a lower security level than the security level of the user profile determination.

When the secondary electronic device is taken off or the connection of the network communication with the first electronic device has an error the first electronic device releases the current user profile.

In step the first electronic device maintains the current security level and security environment during an operation of the authorized user. For example when the display module is turned off the first electronic device maintains the security release according to the setting which controls to change the security level of the security release the security status of the first electronic device with the granted authority to the security level of the lock status of the corresponding user without locking the security level.
