The present invention relates generally to munitions and more particularly to a projectile for use with a tapered bore gun.

Guns having a tapered bore barrel have been used in combat since WWII and their popularity has waxed and waned since that time primarily because projectiles designed to be tired from these guns often exhibited compliant flanges that proved to have marginal structural integrity due to significant deformation while traversing the tapered section of the gun as well as unreliable aerodynamic stability due to the projectile s flanges inability to adequately engage with the rifling resulting in inconsistent gyroscopic stabilization. Modern tapered bore gun typically include a first constant diameter bore extending from the firing chamber of the bore to an intermediate point of the gun barrel and a smaller caliber bore extending a short distance from a front end of the barrel. A tapered bore section then connects the larger diameter first bore with the smaller diameter second bore. Alternatively the tapered bore may extend continuously from the chamber to adjacent the muzzle. Rifling is present in the initial bore section of the tapered bore gun to impart spin to the projectile about its longitudinal axis. The spin acts to gyroscopically stabilize the projectile improving its aerodynamic stability during flight.

When a projectile is fired from the tapered bore gun the larger initial caliber bore of the gun barrel provides for enhanced acceleration of the projectile during gun launch which results in a higher muzzle exit velocity compared to a constant diameter gun of the same caliber as the tapered gun s emergent caliber. The projectile is compressed radially inward by the tapered bore to a smaller diameter that is more aerodynamic due to its smaller frontal area and more streamlined geometry enabling the projectile to achieve greater velocities at extended ranges. However as the projectile is radially compressed it elongates due to the metallic projectile material being incompressible i.e. the volume of the projectile is conserved as it plastically deforms. However the ability of a projectile to be gyroscopically stabilized decreases with increasing projectile length. Therefore the radial compression of the projectile by the tapered bore must be such that it the emergent geometry projectile is aerodynamically stable during flight.

The present invention provides a projectile for use with a tapered bore gun which overcomes the above mentioned disadvantages of the previously known projectiles.

In brief the projectile of the present invention comprises an elongated body having a cylindrical bulkhead with a diameter substantially the same or slightly greater than the large caliber section of the gun bore. A roundly tapered ogive then extends from the cylindrical bulkhead and to a front end of the projectile. A tapered tail section extends from the cylindrical bulkhead to a rear end of the projectile.

A plurality of circumferentially spaced and axially oriented grooves extend forward from the cylindrical bulkhead and to a point short of the front end. These grooves comprise the set of forward grooves. Similarly a plurality of circumferentially spaced and axially oriented grooves extend rearward from the cylindrical bulkhead and to a point short of the rear end of the projectile. These grooves comprise the set of rearward grooves. The projectile also preferably includes a cylindrical bore which extends from the rear end of the projectile and to a point between the front end of the projectile and the cylindrical bulkhead.

Upon firing the cylindrical bulkhead obturates the high pressure launch gases. When the projectile passes through the tapered section of the pin bore the gun bore radially inwardly compresses the projectile. Consequently as the projectile passes through the small caliber section of the gun bore and exits the muzzle the projectile is cylindrical in shape.

The use of the grooves and the axially extending bore operate to perform a number of beneficial functions. The grooves and the axial bore result in the projectile being more easily compressible in the radial direction yet sufficiently stiff and strong in the axial direction. This results in reduced energy losses due to plastic deformation and frictional effects as the projectile traverses the tapered bore section of the gun leading to improved acceleration and muzzle velocity compared to a projectile without the grooves or the bore. Additionally the grooves and the axial bore reduce the volume of material that is compressed and provide a void for it to deform into respectively. Consequently the emergent geometry projectile has a greater margin of aerodynamically stability because it does not grow in length nearly as much as a projectile without grooves or without a bore. Additionally if the projectile is designed such that the axial bore surface terminates forward of the projectile bulkhead the pressure acting on the bore s axial surface will necessarily be a restoring force and will act to reduce projectile balloting and improve accuracy. Lastly the reduced diameter emergent geometry projectile is a aerodynamic low drag high sectional density projectile that is able to be gyroscopically stabilized by the gun s rifling.

With reference to a preferred embodiment of a projectile according to the present invention is shown for use with a tapered bore gun. Such tapered bore guns include a tapered bore section which reduces in diameter or caliber from the breech end of the bore and the muzzle.

The projectile includes an elongated body having a curved surface ogive that is forwardly adjacent to the bulkhead and terminates at a point forward of the elongated body . The projectile has a rear tapered section located rearwardly adjacent to the bulkhead and ends at the rear end . The body is made of a malleable material such as brass and or copper or alloys thereof.

A cylindrical bulkhead of the body has a diameter substantially the same or slightly greater than the caliber of the first or larger caliber section of the tapered gun bore. Consequently when the projectile is loaded into the chamber end of the gun bore the cylindrical bulkhead of the projectile obturates the launch gases for maximum acceleration.

A plurality of axially oriented and circumferentially spaced forward grooves extend forwardly from the cylindrical bulkhead of the body and towards a forward end of the body and thus along the ogive . These grooves however terminate short of the forward end of the body .

Similarly another plurality of axially oriented and circumferentially spaced rearward grooves extend rearwardly from the central bulkhead and toward the rear end of the body . These grooves furthermore terminate short of the rear end of the body so that a tail end of the body is free of rearward grooves . Furthermore the un grooved portion of the rear taper section of the body tapers radially inwardly for a reason to be subsequently described.

As best shown in each of the forward grooves and rearward have a cross sectional area that is generally triangular in shape. The two straight sides of the triangular shaped groove intersect at a point which corresponds to the groove minor diameter. The forward grooves have a groove minor diameter and the and rearward grooves have a groove minor diameter and in this embodiment the forward and rearward grooves have equivalent groove minor diameters. In addition the groove minor diameters and are the distance between diametrically opposed grooves which are substantially equal to or slightly less than the caliber or diameter of the second or smaller caliber bore of the gun.

As best shown in an elongated axially extending bore extends from the rear end to a point forwardly of the cylindrical bulkhead of the body .

The body is preferably a one piece construction and constructed of a ductile material such as brass copper alloys thereof and or the like.

In operation upon firing the projectile initially travels through the initial bore section of the gun bore. As the projectile travels through the tapered section of the gun bore the gun bore compresses the projectile radially inward which simultaneously elongates the projectile to the shape illustrated in . Consequently the projectile is generally elongated and cylindrical in shape upon exit from the muzzle but retains the inwardly tapered section at the rear end of the projectile. This inwardly tapered section often denoted as the projectile s boat tail improves the aerodynamic characteristics of the projectile and reduces aerodynamic drag during flight. Further the grooves are compressed to the extent that the compressed grooves appear as lines in the emergent geometry projectile.

The forward grooves and the rearward on the projectile body achieve several advantages over the previously known ungrooved projectiles for tapered bore guns. The grooves and reduce the material volume of the projectile that is radially compressed while traversing the tapered section of the gun bore. Due to this reduced volume the projectile undergoes less elongation than the previously known projectiles without the grooves.

In addition because the grooves and reduce the volume of compressed material the contact pressure between the projectile and the gun bore is significantly less as the projectile travels through the tapered bore section of the gun bore. This in turn results in less frictional losses for the projectile and therefore greater projectile muzzle velocity.

The grooves and also provide sufficient projectile material to engage the rifling in order to reliably provide spin for the purpose of gyroscopically stabilizing the projectile during flight.

The inwardly tapered section creates a boat tail . This boat tail reduces the aerodynamic drag of the projectile after muzzle exit for increased accuracy.

In addition the bore in the projectile body achieves several advantages. First the bore increases the case of compression of the overall projectile as it travels through the tapered bore section of the gun bore thus reducing friction forces between the projectile and the gun barrel thereby enabling greater muzzle velocity. In addition since the gases during launch act on the entire inner surface of the bore as well as the exterior surfaces of the rear tapered section the pressure acting on the inner surface of the bore prevents deformation of the projectile body during the initial launch. Lastly the bore terminates forward of the bulkhead which when acted upon by the high pressure gases during gun launch also helps maintain the body axially aligned with the gun bore.

Having described my invention many modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art to which it pertains without deviation from the spirit of the invention as defined by the scope of the appended claims.
