title: Presenting messages associated with locations
abstract: A user may express an interest in a set of individuals represented in a set of individual stores (e.g., friends in a social network and colleagues in an academic directory). Such individuals may send to the individual stores messages that are associated with a location, and the user may request, from respective individual stores, a presentation of the locations. According to the techniques presented herein, the messages from the individual stores may be aggregated, and the locations associated with the aggregated messages may be presented in a map, thereby presenting to the user the locations of the messages of the individuals irrespective of from which individual store each message was received. Additionally, the map may present the messages to the user, and upon receiving form the user a reply to a message, may send the message to the individual store from which the message was received.

The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 104 351 filed May 10 2011 and also entitled Presenting Messages Associated With Locations the entirety of which is incorporated by reference as if fully rewritten herein.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve a user who is associated with a set of individuals represented in an individual store such as acquaintances with whom the user has established a relationship in a social academic or professional network and individuals associated with an organization including the user and represented within an organization contact store. In such scenarios respective individuals may author and send the user specifically or as part of a group including the user one or more messages. Moreover such messages may be associated with a location such as a location of the individual upon sending the message a location that the individual has visited in the past or intends to visit in the future or a location associated with the content of the message authored by the individual.

The user may present to a device a request to view the messages presented by such individuals within an individual store. For example in a social network the user may request to view the messages generated by the individuals of the social network with whom the individual has a relationship. The device may therefore contact an individual store receive the messages sent by such individuals and present the messages to the user. Moreover the device may indicate to the user the location of the message e.g. presenting a text identifier picture or map of the location .

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

A user may have relationships with or interest in individuals represented in several individual stores. For example the user may be part of one or more organizations respectively featuring an organization directory including the individuals of the organization a professional networking service comprising a set of individuals having professional relationships with the user an academic networking service comprising a set of individuals having academic relationships with the user and a social networking service comprising a set of individuals having social relationships with the user. Individuals represented within these various individual stores may write messages to the user that are associated with a location e.g. a location where the individual is located while writing the message a location mentioned by the individual in the message or a location that the individual has visited in the past or intends to visit in the future . However in order to view all of these messages the user may have to visit each individual store and request the messages from the individuals represented in the individual store.

Presented herein are techniques for improving the experience of a user while viewing a set of messages posted by individuals on two or more individual stores. In accordance with these techniques a device operated by the user may request and receive the messages from all of the individual stores and may aggregate the messages for presentation to the user. The device may then identify a location associated with each message and present the messages to the user in the form of a map indicating the locations associated with the messages. Moreover the map may be restricted to messages associated with a location within a vicinity of the user location of the user and or to messages posted within a range of a particular date. Many variations in the generation of the map and presentation to the user may be devised by those having ordinary skill in the art while implementing the techniques presented herein.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve a user who wishes to receive a set of messages from a specific set of individuals who are represented in an individual store. As a first example the individual store may comprise a social network the individuals may comprise family members friends and acquaintances with whom the individual has established a social relationship and the messages may comprise public or semi public status messages. As a second example the individual store may comprise a professional or academic directory the individuals may comprise professional or academic colleagues with whom the individual has interacted in a business or school and the messages may comprise private messages send to the user through the network messaging system. As a third example the individual store may comprise a public or semi public status service the individuals may comprise public figures e.g. celebrities or cultural leaders in whom the user has expressed an interest e.g. by requesting to follow the status messages submitted by the individuals and the messages may comprise the status updates presented by such individuals for consumption by the followers of the individual. Additionally the user may wish to view messages submitted by individuals to a plurality of individual stores e.g. a social network a professional network and a company directory .

In these and other scenarios individuals may write messages either impersonal or specifically addressed to the individual that the individual store may deliver to the user. In particular many of these messages may reference a location such as the location of the individual at the time of writing the message a location that is referenced within the content of the message or a location that the individual has visited in the past or intends to visit in the future. Accordingly the location associated with a message may be presented to the user within the body of the message e.g. I visited the park today may be presented to the user with the message e.g. the following message was sent by the individual from the park or may be extracted from the message and presented apart from the message e.g. this individual has sent messages from or referenced the following locations . . . . An individual store may also facilitate the presentation of the location to the user for example if the individual store may identify a location associated with a message in an unambiguous manner e.g. a set of global positioning system GPS coordinates the individual store may supplement the presentation of the message with additional information about the location such as a map or aerial photograph of the location.

However the exemplary scenario of presents some disadvantages. For example the presentations are isolated to the messages stored by a particular individual store and in order to view the messages of all individuals the user may have to request receive and review separate presentations generated by the separate individual stores . There is no synergy or aggregation of the messages even if messages presented in different individual stores reference the same location or if the same individual presents the same message referencing the same location within separate individual stores . Additionally the individual stores simply present the messages associated with locations but do not facilitate the user by providing any further information about the locations such as a map of the locations.

In view of these disadvantages presented herein are exemplary techniques for presenting messages associated with locations that are written by individuals and stored in two or more individual stores . In accordance with these techniques instead of being presented in separate presentations based on the individual store wherein each message is stored the messages presented by such individuals may be aggregated into a joint presentation . For example an embodiment of these techniques may be configured to contact several individual stores to receive all of the messages stored therein aggregate all of the messages and generate the aggregated presentation of the messages for the user . Moreover the locations associated with such messages may be received and evaluated and the aggregated presentation may present all of the referenced locations as a map. The aggregated presentation may therefore enable the user to view the entire set of locations referenced in messages by individuals e.g. a map of an area illustrating the locations that the individuals have referenced such as where such individuals are located when authoring the messages or where such individuals intend or suggest to visit .

Still another embodiment involves a computer readable medium comprising processor executable instructions configured to apply the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may include e.g. computer readable storage media involving a tangible device such as a memory semiconductor e.g. a semiconductor utilizing static random access memory SRAM dynamic random access memory DRAM and or synchronous dynamic random access memory SDRAM technologies a platter of a hard disk drive a flash memory device or a magnetic or optical disc such as a CD R DVD R or floppy disc encoding a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may also include as a class of technologies that are distinct from computer readable storage media various types of communications media such as a signal that may be propagated through various physical phenomena e.g. an electromagnetic signal a sound wave signal or an optical signal and in various wired scenarios e.g. via an Ethernet or fiber optic cable and or wireless scenarios e.g. a wireless local area network WLAN such as WiFi a personal area network PAN such as Bluetooth or a cellular or radio network and which encodes a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein.

An exemplary computer readable medium that may be devised in these ways is illustrated in wherein the implementation comprises a computer readable medium e.g. a CD R DVD R or a platter of a hard disk drive on which is encoded computer readable data . This computer readable data in turn comprises a set of computer instructions configured to operate according to the principles set forth herein. In one such embodiment the processor executable instructions may be configured to perform a method of presenting to a user messages written by individuals and associated with locations such as the exemplary method of or the exemplary method of . Some embodiments of this computer readable medium may comprise a nontransitory computer readable storage medium e.g. a hard disk drive an optical disc or a flash memory device that is configured to store processor executable instructions configured in this manner. Many such computer readable media may be devised by those of ordinary skill in the art that are configured to operate in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects and some variations may present additional advantages and or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover some variations may be implemented in combination and some combinations may feature additional advantages and or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments e.g. the exemplary method of and the exemplary method of to confer individual and or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.

A first aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques related to the scenarios wherein such techniques may be utilized. As a first example many types of individuals may write and send messages to many types of individual stores such as family members friends or acquaintances having a profile in a social network colleagues who are listed in a professional or academic directory and public figures such as celebrities or cultural leaders who post public messages to weblogs. As a second example of this first aspect these techniques may be utilized to present many types of messages including text messages audio messages such as voice messages and picture or video messages including pictures or video of a particular location and various types of data files including a message written by an individual e.g. an extensible markup language XML file including a list of locations that the individual has visited or intends to visit . As a third example of this first aspect locations may be associated with messages in many ways such as a location where a message was written by the individual a location referenced in the content of the message or a location associated with the message e.g. a report of a location visited by the individual in the past or a location that the individual intends to visit in the future . Additionally the location may be associated with the message in various ways e.g. an explicit reference to a location by name address or latitude longitude coordinates or an implicit reference to a location such as a comment that the individual is at home where a home address of the individual may be retrieved . As a fourth example many types of maps may be presented to the user including road maps topographical maps stylized maps featuring stylized depictions of the locations pictorial maps featuring photographic images of the locations . Such maps may be two or three dimensional and may be static moving and or interactive. As a fifth example the map may be presented on many types of devices operated by the user such as a desktop or portable computer a television or a handheld device such as a smartphone or global positioning system GPS receiver. Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many such scenarios wherein the techniques presented herein may be utilized.

A second aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the manner of receiving messages from the respective individual stores . As a first example an embodiment of these techniques may contact each individual store to request and retrieve the messages stored therein that are accessible to the user . This request may involve e.g. sending a web request to a website receiving a web page including a presentation of the messages and utilizing various techniques e.g. web scraping to extract the messages and locations associated therewith. Alternatively one or more individual stores may present an individual store interface such as a web service a database interface or an application programming interface API through which the messages may be received in an automated manner and an embodiment may invoke the individual store interface to request the messages . Alternatively one or more individual stores may be configured to send messages to a user automatically upon receiving the message from an individual e.g. a push architecture . For example a device operated by the user may contact the individual store to provide an address e.g. an internet protocol IP address or an email address where the individual store is to send messages and may monitor the address to receive messages spontaneously sent by the individual store .

As a second example of this second aspect an individual store may be configured to present messages publicly to any user even unknown and or anonymous users . Alternatively an individual store may only provide messages to particular users and before sending messages to any user may endeavor to authenticate the user according to at least one credential e.g. a login username and password a security certificate a cryptographic signature or a detected biometric . Accordingly an embodiment of these techniques may be configured to upon receiving a credential authenticating the user store the credential and to while requesting a message from an individual store authenticate the user with the individual store according to at least one credential.

As a third example of this second aspect the user may have a particular user location such as a location where the user is currently located. The user location of the user may be specified by the user or may be automatically detected and or inferred e.g. by invoking a global positioning system GPS receiver interfacing with a device implementing an embodiment of these techniques or by triangulating with nearly location sources such as wireless networks or cellular towers having a known location . In such scenarios the embodiment of these techniques may be configured to request messages associated with locations within a range of the user location e.g. locations in the vicinity of the user . If the user is only interested in messages relating to nearly locations this embodiment may conserve the computing resources and improve the performance of the device and or the information stores by only requesting receiving and presenting the messages within the vicinity of the user location that are of interest to the user . Moreover the device may be generally configured to request messages from the individual store at a message query frequency but may request messages from an individual store that are associated with a location at a location message query frequency that is higher than the message query frequency e.g. pinging or querying the individual store once every five minutes for updates to the messages but also pinging or querying the individual store once every thirty seconds for updates to messages associated with locations . This variation may be advantageous e.g. for presenting messages associated with locations with lower latency since such messages may be more time sensitive and or ephemeral e.g. messages indicating a current location of an individual than other messages .

As a fourth example of this second aspect an embodiment of these techniques may request messages from one or more individual stores upon receiving the request from the user to present the messages e.g. an ad hoc retrieval of messages . Alternatively an embodiment may frequently and or continuously retrieve and store the messages e.g. through either a push mechanism or a pull mechanism at a first time point even in the absence of such a request. A later time a second time point after the first time point the embodiment may receive such a request from the user and may generate the map using the previously received and stored messages . This variation may be advantageous e.g. for presenting the messages more rapidly than the alternative embodiment which has to contact the individual stores and request and receive the messages . Moreover frequently or continuously storing messages may enable other features. For example the request may upon receiving a message store a time point with the message e.g. the time when the message was written by an individual and or received from the individual store . The request received from the user may specify a selected time point and an embodiment may retrieve from the message store and generate a map from only the messages having a time point within a range of the selected time point e.g. within one hour of the selected time point . This variation may enable the user to view a past or historical set of locations visited by the individuals e.g. show a map of locations that my contacts within a social network visited yesterday .

A third aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the generation of the map presenting to the user the locations associated with the messages . As a first example if a user location of the user may be identified e.g. provided by a global positioning system GPS receiver communicating with a device including an embodiment of these techniques the map may be localized to the user location of the user such as restricting the map to a particular range within the vicinity of the user location.

As a second example of this third aspect the map may indicate among the locations depicted on the map one or more popular locations that are frequently associated with messages written by the individuals . For example an embodiment may identify for respective locations a message count of messages that are associated with the location and may identify on the map the locations having a high message count e.g. by highlighting the indicators of such locations or using a distinctive indicator therefor .

As a third example of this third aspect the map may use different visual indicators to indicate different properties of the locations depicted on the map . As one such example respective individual stores may be associated with a visual identifier distinguishing the individual store from other individual stores and the map may depict the locations with the distinctive visual identifier of the individual store from which the message associated with the location was received. Similarly distinguishing visual identifiers may be used to identify e.g. which individual posted messages associated with the locations or the types of locations depicted on the map .

As a fourth example of this third aspect various techniques may be utilized to filter the locations presented on the map . For example respective messages may have at least one message property such as a message type e.g. a brief text message such as a status posted in a social network a narrative message such as an anecdote or document an audio recording captured at a location or a photo or video recording that depicts the location . The request received from the user may specify at least one selected message property and the map may be generated from the messages having the at least one selected message property e.g. only depicting locations depicted in photo messages .

As a fifth example of this third aspect an embodiment of these techniques may be configured to update the map with information received after initially generating the map . For example while presenting a map to a user an embodiment may receive from an individual store a new message having a location and may update the map with the new message. This variation may be advantageous e.g. where a user is referring to the map for up to date information about the individuals such as the current locations of the individuals in an area . Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many ways of presenting the map while implementing the techniques presented herein.

A fourth aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to additional features that may be implemented in such techniques. As a first example the map may also present the messages associated with respective locations to the user e.g. upon receiving from the user a selection of a location an embodiment of these techniques may present the messages associated with the selected location . Alternatively or additionally an embodiment may be configured to upon receiving a reply from a user to a message associated with a location presented on the map send the reply to an individual store including the individual store from which the message referenced by the reply was received .

As a second example of this fourth aspect the presentation of a map restricted to a vicinity of a user location of a user may include offers associated with businesses located in the vicinity of the user location. For example an embodiment of these techniques may receive a set of offers from respective businesses having a location e.g. opportunistic discounts on goods or services and if the user views a map of an area including the location of a business the associated offers may be presented on the map .

As a third example of this fourth aspect the device configured to present maps according to these techniques may also have one or more capabilities. For example the device may comprise a mobile phone presenting a voice capability a mobile texting device with a software or hardware keyboard presenting a texting capability or a camera presenting an image sending capability. Accordingly the embodiment of these techniques may be configured to while presenting messages associated with locations presented on the map identify one or more message options that are associated with respective messages and may present the message options in relation to the messages on the map . For example if a user operating a text capable device selects a location identified in a text message from an individual the map may include a message option to send a text message to the individual . In this manner the embodiment of these techniques may utilize the capabilities of the device in the presentation of the map of the locations .
