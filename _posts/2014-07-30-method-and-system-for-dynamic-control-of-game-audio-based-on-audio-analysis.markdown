title: Method and system for dynamic control of game audio based on audio analysis
abstract: A gaming device, during play of a particular game, receives a plurality of audio channels carrying game sounds and determines whether a first of the game sounds overwhelms a second of the game sounds. In response to the determination, the gaming device adjusts a level of one or more of the audio channels such that perceptibility of the second game sound is improved relative to perceptibility of the first game sound prior to the adjustment, wherein for the adjustment, a level of one or more of the audio channels carrying the first game sound is decreased while a level of one or more of the audio channels carrying the second game sound is maintained or increased. The audio channels include three or more audio channels and the adjustment of the level of the audio channels is performed while the three or more audio channels are combined into two stereo channels.

This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. provisional patent application 61 887 526 titled Method and System for Dynamic Control of Game Audio Based on Audio Analysis which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 040 144 titled Gaming Headset with Programmable Audio and published as US2012 0014553 is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Aspects of the present application relate to electronic gaming. More specifically to methods and systems for dynamic control of game audio based on audio analysis.

Limitations and disadvantages of conventional approaches to audio processing for gaming will become apparent to one of skill in the art through comparison of such approaches with some aspects of the present method and system set forth in the remainder of this disclosure with reference to the drawings.

Methods and systems are provided for dynamic control of game audio based on audio analysis substantially as illustrated by and or described in connection with at least one of the figures as set forth more completely in the claims.

Certain embodiments of the disclosure may be found in a method and system for dynamic control of game audio based on audio analysis. In accordance with various embodiments of the disclosure a gaming device such as a gaming headset during play of a particular game may receive a plurality of audio channels carrying game sounds and determine whether a first of the game sounds overwhelms a second of the game sounds. In response to the determination the gaming device may adjust a level of one or more of the audio channels such that perceptibility of the second game sound is improved relative to perceptibility of the first game sound prior to the adjustment. For the adjustment a level of one or more of the audio channels carrying the first game sound is decreased while a level of one or more of the audio channels carrying the second game sound is maintained or increased. The audio channels include three or more audio channels and the adjustment of the level of the audio channels may be performed while the three or more audio channels are combined into two stereo channels. When the first game sound ceases to overwhelm the second game sound the gaming device is increases the level of the one or more audio channels that carries the first game sound while the level of the one or more audio channels carrying the second game sound is maintained or decreased. The determination is done dynamically based on signal analysis of the plurality of audio channels and or acquired audio information for the particular game. The gaming device stores the audio information for the particular game a first time the particular game is played on the gaming device. The decreasing of the level of the one or more of the audio channels may comprise muting. The gaming device unmutes the audio channel that carries the first game sound when the first game sound ceases to overwhelm the second game sound. The gaming device acquires the audio information for the particular game from a source within the gaming device and or from a source external to the gaming device. The audio information may be acquired when the play of the particular game is started on the gaming device. The one of the plurality of audio channels that carries the first game sound may comprise a center audio channel.

Sometimes during game play loud sounds may distract a player and this may hinder the player s game play experience rather than provide a more fulfilling game experience. For example sound indicative of a first player s own actions within the game may drown out or overwhelm the sound of another second player within the game. In this regard the first player may not adequately hear the sound of an approaching second player or the sound of the second player s vehicle approaching. In a more specific example in a racing game the sound of a first driver s own car engine may drown out or overwhelm the sound of a fast approaching competitor s car engine. Various embodiments of the disclosure may be operable to detect the sound of the approaching second player and the sound of the approaching competitor s car engine and mute a sound on a channel that is drowning out or overwhelming the sound of the approaching second player and the sound of the approaching competitor s car engine. In this regard the sound indicative of a player s actions within the game may be decreased or muted so that the sound of another approaching player may be heard by the player that has a role involving loud noises. Similarly the sound of the first driver s own car engine may be decreased or muted so that the sound of the approaching competitor s car engine may be heard by the player that has the role of the first driver.

Throughout this disclosure the use of the terms dynamically and or adaptively with respect to an operation means that for example parameters for configurations for and or execution of the operation may be configured or reconfigured during run time e.g. in or near real time based on newly received or updated information or data. For example an operation within a transmitter and or a receiver may be configured or reconfigured based on for example current recently received and or updated signals information and or data.

The present method and or system may be realized in hardware software or a combination of hardware and software. The present methods and or systems may be realized in a centralized fashion in at least one computing system or in a distributed fashion where different elements are spread across several interconnected computing systems. Any kind of computing system or other apparatus adapted for carrying out the methods described herein is suited. A typical combination of hardware and software may be a general purpose computing system with a program or other code that when being loaded and executed controls the computing system such that it carries out the methods described herein. Another typical implementation may comprise an application specific integrated circuit or chip. Some implementations may comprise a non transitory machine readable e.g. computer readable medium e.g. FLASH drive optical disk magnetic storage disk or the like having stored thereon one or more lines of code executable by a machine thereby causing the machine to perform processes as described herein.

While the present method and or system has been described with reference to certain implementations it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted without departing from the scope of the present method and or system. In addition many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the present disclosure without departing from its scope. Therefore it is intended that the present method and or system not be limited to the particular implementations disclosed but that the present method and or system will include all implementations falling within the scope of the appended claims.
