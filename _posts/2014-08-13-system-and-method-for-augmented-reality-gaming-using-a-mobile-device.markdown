This disclosure is directed to wagering games gaming machines networked gaming systems and methods and in particular to the maintenance of these wagering games gaming machines networked gaming systems and methods.

Previously various types of gaming machines have been developed with different features to captivate and maintain player interest. In general a gaming machine allows a player to play a game in exchange for a wager. Depending on the outcome of the game the player may be entitled to an award which is paid to the player by the gaming machine normally in the form of currency or game credits. Gaming machines may include flashing displays lighted displays or sound effects to capture a player s interest in a gaming device.

Another important feature of maintaining player interest in a gaming machine includes providing the player with many opportunities to win awards such as cash or prizes. For example in some slot machines the display windows show more than one adjacent symbol on each reel thereby allowing for multiple line betting.

In the past manufacturers have developed systems for control of gaming machines. Specifically these have included applications for denying self excluded gamblers from playing slot machines bonusing of anonymous players and allowing a player to participate in a casino loyalty scheme without the need to insert a physical card into the gaming machine.

While gaming machines including feature games have been successful there remains a need for feature games that provide players with enhanced excitement and an increased opportunity of winning.

Briefly and in general terms the method is disclosed for enabling a user in an augmented reality gaming venue to use an augmented reality gaming venue component and a mobile device to find a particular game or gaming machine. The method includes controlling a camera on the mobile device using the augmented reality gaming venue component once the component is activated determining the location of the mobile device determining the orientation of the mobile device querying a casino management system to retrieve data for the augmented reality gaming venue generating a list of gaming machines and other objects currently visible to the camera rendering a camera captured image on a display of the mobile device and overlaying icons on the image for each visible object to display additional visual information to a user on the display of the mobile device in response to the user aiming the mobile device at gaming machines or other objects of interest in the augmented reality gaming venue.

In another embodiment another gaming method is disclosed for enabling a user in an augmented reality gaming venue to use an augmented reality gaming assistance component and a mobile device to find additional gaming options or information for a game displayed on a gaming machine. This method includes controlling a camera on the mobile device using the augmented reality gaming assistance component once the component is activated enabling a user to capture the output from the gaming machine via the camera wherein the output includes an image of a pay table of the game or the game title and an image of a current game state sending the images via a network to a server determining transmitting and displaying possible strategies for use by a player of the game title in the current game state and overlaying virtual graphics on a display of the mobile device that either appear to be on a display of the gaming machine when viewed via the mobile phone or augment the display of the gaming machine with elements that indicate points of interest on the gaming machine.

Continuing in another aspect of some embodiments a gaming method is disclosed that includes controlling a camera on the mobile device using the augmented reality gaming assistance component once the component is activated enabling a user to capture the output from the gaming machine via the camera wherein the output includes an image of a pay table of the game or the game title and an image of a current game state sending the images via a network to a server determining transmitting and displaying possible strategies for use by a player of the game title in the current game state and overlaying virtual graphics on a display of the mobile device that either appear to be on a display of the gaming machine when viewed via the mobile phone augment the display of the gaming machine with elements that indicate points of interest on the gaming machine. In some embodiments an object recognition system of the augmented reality gaming assistance component extracts data marks from the display of the gaming machine which transmit varying intensive light and wherein the data marks are used as a one way communication method from the gaming machine to the augmented reality gaming assistance component.

Features and advantages will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example the features of the various embodiments.

Various embodiments are directed to a game gaming machine gaming systems and method for playing a game wherein the gaming system includes biometrically controlled door locks. The embodiments are illustrated and described herein by way of example only and not by way of limitation. Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to there are shown illustrative examples of games gaming machines gaming systems and methods for playing a game in accordance with various aspects of the gaming system which includes biometrically controlled door locks.

An example in accordance with one or more aspects of a disclosed embodiment is shown in . A preferred embodiment of a gaming system includes a biometrically controlled door lock . The biometrically controlled door lock enables a technician to open a gaming machine door without needing a master key. Instead the technicians present themselves to a camera built into the gaming machine and a picture is taken of them. This picture is transmitted to the casino management system CMS and if the facial recognition software running on the CMS identifies the technician as being authorized a message is sent to the EGM electronic gaming machine to unlock the door. The gaming machine has a solenoid attached to the door lock and is able to unlock the door under software control. The advantage of such a system is that it removes the need for a casino to issue master keys to technicians.

A preferred embodiment of a gaming system which includes biometrically controlled door locks enables a technician to open a gaming machine without using a key. Traditional key and lock systems are difficult to change. Moreover the disclosed gaming system offers better security than either the existing key or biometric systems. Additionally a preferred embodiment of a gaming system which includes biometrically controlled door locks is also much cheaper to deploy requiring only a software controlled solenoid to be installed in each gaming machine.

A preferred embodiment of this gaming system which includes biometrically controlled door locks leverages existing mobile smart phones. By way of example only and not by way of limitation such smart phones include Apple s iPhone series Google s Droid and Nexus One series Palm s Pre series and RIM s Blackberry series of smart phones. Most if not all of these smart phones include a built in camera that can be controlled by software applications. Accordingly preferred embodiments of this gaming system move the camera from the gaming machine to a smart phone carried by the technician. In more detail the components that make up the gaming system having biometrically controlled door locks may be seen in . In this regard a preferred embodiment of a locking system should employ 1 something you are e.g. a biometric 2 something you know e.g. a PIN and 3 something you possess e.g. a physical token such as a key .

As part of one aspect of a disclosed embodiment a technician is equipped with a smart phone. Additionally a manufacturer develops a specific biometric lock application for this embodiment that is deployed by casino IT staff. For security purposes this application is not widely distributed and it is not downloadable by the public. The biometric lock application is capable of taking photographs using the camera built into the phone and passing these photographs over an encrypted internet Secure Socket Layer connection to a web server connected to the CMS. In some embodiments the web server also provides context sensitive help documents to the mobile phone in addition to being able to take photographs.

In a preferred embodiment of a gaming system having biometrically controlled door locks each gaming machine is equipped with a solenoid to control the opening of the cabinet door. The gaming machine also includes software to enable commands to be sent from the CMS to enable the door to be opened by triggering the solenoid. In addition the gaming machine preferably has a sticker or placard attached that uniquely identifies the machine. This may be achieved by a barcode printed on the sticker.

Referring now to the process in a technician is tasked to perform some maintenance on a gaming machine. In practice he or she approaches the gaming machine in question and starts the technician biometric lock application on the smart phone. The technician is prompted to scan the gaming machine s barcode and then the biometric lock application presents the current image being read by the camera on the phone s LCD screen. Once the technician positions the camera at a suitable distance from the barcode the image is captured and sent via the encrypted link over the internet to the web server. At the web server the image analysis software decodes the image and determines that it is a barcode. The barcode decoding module determines an identifier which is used by the Machine ID database to determine which gaming machine has been scanned.

In some preferred embodiments the CMS then responds back to the mobile phone with information about the gaming machine so that the technician may confirm that the barcode is correct. This information may consist of the name of the game currently loaded on the gaming machine and other identifying information.

After confirming that the gaming machine is correct for security purposes at this point the technician must enter a PIN Personal Identification Number or a user identifier password combination. These credentials are transmitted to the CMS via the internet. The mobile phone application then tells the technician to take a self portrait using the camera on the mobile phone. For some phones equipped with dual cameras such as most Nokia models the iPhone 4 and the HTC EVO this simply means holding the phone up to get a good view of the face. In the case where the phone has only one camera the technician turns the phone around so that the camera faces him or her and presses the button on the user interface of the phone to take a picture.

The captured image is also sent up to the CMS via the secure cellular internet connection. As an alternative to the use of secure connections over the internet a WiFi local network may also be used if it is present in the casino. At the CMS the image analysis software passes the self portrait to the facial recognition system which determines the employee identifier associated with the face presented.

In addition to the credentials described above in another aspect of some embodiments the smart phone itself may be married to a particular employee. In such embodiments in every transaction a unique identifier for the phone may also be transmitted. This identifier is set at install time and cannot be changed by the technician. Alternatively the phone s IMEI International Mobile Equipment Identity number or other cellular identifier may be used.

In some preferred embodiments of the gaming system having biometrically controlled door locks all four credentials are passed to the unlock application at the CMS including 1 the employee ID 2 the phone identifier 3 the machine ID and 4 the PIN. If all credentials are valid i.e. if the employee is currently allowed to unlock the gaming machine an unlock signal is sent over the CMS network to the gaming machine. Once the gaming machine receives this signal the controller associated with the door solenoid causes it to be tripped. In other embodiments only three of the four credentials are passed to the unlock application at the CMS.

Once opened a specific set of help pages are retrieved by the CMS from a gaming machine instruction manual server to aid the technician in his tasks. These pages are made available on the smart phone for the technician to peruse and are specific to the game and cabinet combination in question.

To further assist the technician at any time he or she may take a photograph of the gaming machine s LCD display. Any error messages lockup messages or menus displayed may be read by the image analysis module at the CMS and by OCR Optical character recognition may be used to index into context sensitive help for the particular problem.

In addition to a barcode on the exterior of the gaming machine each peripheral within the machine may also have a barcode. By scanning the barcode with the camera on the mobile phone using the mobile phone application context sensitive help may also be retrieved for maintaining the peripheral or for determining the asset status or configuration of a peripheral.

Some preferred implementations of the disclosed embodiments use a smart phone with two cameras and OpenCV image analysis software. Additionally some embodiments 1 provide a cheaper solution than installing cameras in each gaming machine 2 enable a casino to update software keys without needing to replace thousands of locks 3 enable technicians to carry a physical token i.e. the smart phone that is very difficult to copy 4 employs facial recognition and PIN security measures that prevent casual theft of a smart phone causing security issues and 5 technicians can receive context sensitive help to fix a particular gaming machine. In other aspects some embodiments provide 1 use of the combination of phone camera facial recognition barcode and network controlled solenoid to open a gaming machine door and 2 context sensitive help for maintenance of the gaming machine delivered by phone to authorized personnel. In this manner a technician points his phone s camera at an error message and receives help to fix the specific problem associated with the error message.

In another aspect of some embodiments gaming systems are utilized that include augmented reality viewing capabilities . In such embodiments of the disclosed gaming system smart phones are utilized that include a built in gyroscope as well as location tracking technology such as a digital compass and a GPS system Global Positioning System . These features enable the accurate position and orientation of the smart phones and its user to be derived. Additionally some other embodiments of the disclosed gaming system use object recognition and OCR Optical character recognition techniques combined with location orientation derivation to provide players in casinos easy ways of finding games progressive jackpots particular machines and other players of their choice.

The overall arrangement of the gaming systems that include augmented reality viewing capabilities may be seen in . In broad terms gaming systems that include augmented reality viewing capabilities include an application loaded onto a camera enabled smart phone a back end system for assisting the application and integration modules for connecting to an existing Business Intelligence System BIS .

In some embodiments the Business Intelligence System provides a database or other structure that includes a table of the position and orientation of every gaming machine in a venue. Continuing in such embodiments each position orientation is associated with a unique identifier that enables this system to query the Casino Management System CMS to retrieve data for the gaming machine in question such as current occupancy historical performance current denomination and other relevant attributes.

The basic operation of one embodiment of a gaming system that includes augmented reality viewing capabilities is shown in . A player installs an augmented reality venue application on his phone and activates the application when he enters the venue. Preferably the application may be automatically activated by a Bluetooth or wireless message that is received by the phone when it passes through a portal such as a casino entrance. Alternatively the application may be automatically activated by a locale condition programmed into the smart phone tied to the venue s GPS location. In the simplest implementation the application is manually activated by the player.

Once activated the application of the gaming system having augmented reality viewing capabilities begins to control the inbuilt primary camera of the smart phone. In one such embodiment a message is displayed on the smart phone display asking the user to aim the camera at gaming machines or other objects of interest in the venue.

Once aimed the augmented reality application determines the location of the phone by means such as GPS Bluetooth or cell tower triangulation. In another embodiment the augmented reality application determines the location of the phone by analysis of the image being captured by the camera. In this regard physical reference points may be placed in the casino for the camera to find. Next the orientation of the phone is determined. This may be accomplished by accessing the internal digital gyroscope embedded within the smart phone.

Once the location orientation of the smart phone is known the objects of interest such as gaming machines that may be seen by the smart phone s camera may be computed. This may be achieved by placing the camera position orientation within a virtual 3D representation of the venue. This virtual representation may be built up offline by parsing the Business Intelligence System table of position orientations of gaming machines and other objects. From time to time this representation may be updated to take into account the moving of gaming machines and signage around the venue.

In one embodiment of the gaming system having augmented reality viewing capabilities a list of gaming machines and other objects currently visible to the camera are built up. For each object visible a virtual position on the smart phone display may be derived by performing an inverse projection matrix on the co ordinates of the gaming machine. The camera captured image is rendered on the smart phone display and an icon is overlaid on the image for each visible object. An example of this output is shown in .

As shown in in another aspect of the gaming system having augmented reality viewing capabilities some different types of icons may be shown depending upon the type of object or some meta data associated with an object. In the example shown in a standard gaming machine is shown with a green icon a gaming machine that is being played and thus unavailable is shown with a blue icon and the gaming machine with the highest payout over a recent period of time i.e. the hottest gaming machine is shown with a red icon.

Another type of icon shown in the embodiment of is a user icon. This user icon represents another player such as a player that the current user has an affinity with e.g. a spouse or relative . In some embodiments of the gaming system having augmented reality viewing capabilities the player may register affinities in the CMS or via the augmented reality venue application. By employing such an embodiment the player is able to find their spouse by simply panning their camera around until the user icon is straight ahead.

Notably icons such as the user icon need not represent an object directly visible by the player. In some embodiments of the augmented reality venue system signage and banks of gaming machines may be between the player and their spouse but do not affect the operation of this system.

As shown in once an icon is shown the player may touch the touchscreen on their smart phone at the location of the icon to bring up information about the object in question. shows an example of such information. In this example the user has selected the red icon near a Hot Shots game on the image displayed on his phone. This selection causes a pop up window with information about the game including the detail that this is the Hottest Slot by some measure e.g. perhaps this gaming machine has paid out the most money over the last 24 hours .

In some embodiments the pop up window also lets the player know that this gaming machine is available to play which might not be apparent if there are any obstructions between the gaming machine and the user. In one such embodiment this availability information is obtained by the back end systems by querying the CMS to see if any credits or player tracking card are inserted.

Referring now of in another aspect of a gaming system having augmented reality viewing capabilities the pop up window also enables a player to reserve a gaming machine. Reserving gaming machines is popular in some markets and this novel feature extends the reserving feature. If a player chooses to reserve the gaming machine by selecting the button on their smart phone a message is sent up from the phone to the back end system and onto the CMS to reserve the gaming machine. Preferably the CMS generates a PIN and transmits this PIN to the gaming machine and back to the phone. This PIN is displayed on the phone as shown in . The gaming machine then locks up for a period of time to give the player time to walk over. When the player reaches the gaming machine he or she enters the matching PIN and the game is unlocked. Once the time limit is reached the gaming machine automatically unlocks to prevent the gaming machine from being held out of service.

Referring now to an embodiment of a gaming system having augmented reality viewing capabilities is shown in which a user has selected an augmented reality venue with the signage highlighted. This type of reservation may be restricted to users of a certain standing for example Platinum Level players to ensure they have priority for popular games.

Once the list is formed the list is sorted by distance from the user based upon the gaming machine location table in the Business Intelligence System. The nearest gaming machine matching is then presented on the screen if it is visible by a vertical arrow icon pointing at the gaming machine. In some embodiments the arrow icon is flashing. In another aspect of one embodiment if the nearest matching gaming machine is off of the screen a horizontal arrow is displayed that indicates which way the player should rotate themselves to bring the matching gaming machine into view. As the player rotates himself holding the phone in front of him the arrow position is updated and eventually replaced by a vertical arrow pointing directly at the gaming machine.

In one embodiment of a gaming system having augmented reality viewing capabilities Platinum players or other selected players are presented with another option when all gaming machines of a particular type are in use or the player has a particular favorite machine. These players may be given the option to pre reserve a gaming machine or game such that they will be informed by the augmented reality application the moment that their game or favorite machine becomes free. At this point the gaming machine in question will be reserved for a period of time using the PIN method described above.

Referring now to an embodiment of a gaming system having augmented reality viewing capabilities shows yet another feature. As mentioned above players may register affinities to other players. In this example as well as being able to find their friends or spouse the player may choose to find the same game at a different gaming machine they are playing or possibly sending an instant message IM to their friend to be displayed on the friend s gaming machine. In the case of community games the Find Available option may also allow a player to find a free seat in the same community game as their friend.

Some preferred implementations of the disclosed embodiments use 1 a smart phone for the client that has a GPS or other positioning system as well as a gyroscope for accurate orientation detection 2 any suitable web server for communication with the smart phone and registration of players and 3 OpenCV image analysis software. Additionally some embodiments provide features that include by way of example only 1 enabling players to quickly find objects of interest 2 increasing casino revenue by helping players find their favorite games quicker 3 enabling players to reserve games from their phone 4 leveraging technology that players already have and 5 utilizing a system that is inexpensive to deploy since it does not require any new infrastructure. In other aspects some embodiments provide 1 the use of the phone as a way of finding objects in a casino 2 the ability to reserve games from the phone and unlock the games with a PIN 3 notification when games become available and 4 the ability to find other players and the games that they are playing.

In another aspect of some embodiments gaming systems are utilized that include augmented reality gaming capabilities . In such embodiments of the disclosed gaming system smart phones are utilized that include built in object recognition technologies and OCR Optical character recognition techniques combined with location orientation derivation to provide players in casinos with additional gaming options and opportunities. In one embodiment of a gaming system that includes augmented reality gaming capabilities such object recognition technologies and OCR capabilities are similar to those provided by Google s Goggles application.

The overall arrangement of the modules that make up an embodiment of a gaming system that includes augmented reality gaming capabilities may be seen in . In some embodiments the gaming system having augmented reality gaming capabilities consists of an augmented reality gaming application loaded onto a camera enabled mobile smart phone a back end system for assisting the application and in some scenarios additional software modules as part of the gaming machine software.

In one implementation of a gaming system that includes augmented reality gaming capabilities the gaming process proceeds in the following manner. A player approaches a game machine to play a game e.g. Joker Poker . Joker Poker is a video poker game in which a player makes a decision about which cards to hold or draw. During the game the player may reach a point where the player is unsure of the correct strategy with which to proceed. When this point of uncertainty occurs the player may take out his mobile phone and select the augmented reality gaming assistance application. Next the player is prompted to point his smart phone s camera to the gaming machine screen. Once the camera is aimed at the screen the player presses the camera shutter button and an image is captured as seen in .

The augmented reality gaming assistance application transmits the image to the backend server via a 3G third generation or GPRS General Packet Radio Service encrypted SSL secure socket layer session to a public web service and awaits a response. The backend server using object recognition and OCR technology determines the following from analyzing the image 1 the paytable of the game and thus the game title 2 the current game state and 3 the player s credit bet information. From the first two of these items all possible strategies are determined by the system. This information along with the game name and state is transmitted back to the augmented reality gaming assistance application on the mobile phone over the 3G connection.

In one embodiment the augmented reality gaming assistance application may present the information to the player in a number of ways as shown in . In the example of the theoretical best choice for the player is presented for the game of Joker Poker along with information concerning the possible outcomes to the game. Notably the player is free to experiment on the assistance application of the player s smart phone selecting and de selecting potential cards to hold. During this process the odds are presented below the cards as the cards are being updated to reflect the current scenario e.g. after each selection de selection .

While the augmented reality gaming assistance application is clearly useful for beginner players the application is also useful for more expert players by taking into account progressive jackpots which may cause strategy to vary depending upon the current progressive amount. Furthermore the augmented reality gaming assistance application provides additional benefits whenever variables are added to games such as a wild card or when more complex odds are associated with the outcome of a game.

In some embodiments of the gaming system having augmented reality gaming capabilities once the game title is determined other information can also be made available by the phone application. For example links to tutorials discussion forums and social networking sites specific to the game may be offered. Such tutorials may take into account the current state of the game and offer context sensitive help.

In other more sophisticated embodiments of the gaming system that include augmented reality gaming capabilities the gaming process proceeds in the following manner. While the video poker example presented above provides the content on the player s smart phone related to the game these above described embodiments do not augment the output of the gaming machine directly. However in more sophisticated embodiments of the gaming system that includes augmented reality gaming capabilities an augmented display captures the output from the gaming machine via the camera in the phone and overlays virtual graphics on the smart phone s display that either 1 appear to be on the gaming machine display when viewed via the mobile phone or 2 augment the gaming machine display with elements that indicate points of interest on the gaming machine.

Referring now to one embodiment of a gaming system having augmented reality gaming capabilities that illustrates how an augmented feature may be deployed is shown. Firstly a player associates the gaming machine being played with the phone he is holding. This association may be accomplished in a number of ways two of which are described below. In the first association technique the gaming machine begins displaying calibration marks at the corner of the LCD display or in other unobtrusive positions once the augmented session has begun. An example of these calibration marks is shown in . Continuing as the player holds the camera of the smart phone up in front of the gaming machine the application controlled camera captures the image of the gaming machine including the game LCD output. Since it is unlikely that the player will be holding the camera directly parallel to the LCD the image of the LCD will likely be slightly trapezoidal as shown in .

Referring now to the object recognition system takes this image and extracts the calibration marks. In some embodiments the object recognition system uses a standard object recognition algorithm. Notably this amount of computation is well within the real time capability of today s modern smart phone. If more advanced computational processing is required for some reason the object recognition algorithm may be run by transmitting the image to the backend server where the image may be processed. This is not the preferred solution due to the time taken to transmit the image would likely interfere with real time overlay by producing significant lag. In a more preferred embodiment once the calibration marks are decoded the mobile phone application overlays images at suitable points on the camera derived image. The techniques for achieving this image overlay are described above with respect to the gaming system having an augmented reality venue .

Referring now to an example of potential context sensitive help being overlaid at the correct position on the camera image is shown. In such an embodiment of the gaming system having augmented reality gaming capabilities a player is assigned a lucky symbol for a feature. In some embodiments the determination of this symbol is based upon past performance by the player of this game past performance of the machine a hashing algorithm based upon the player s name or telephone number or combinations thereof. Continuing when the player reaches the selection stage of the feature the player uses the augmented reality application on his smart phone to take a photo or video and receive the image overlay as shown in .

Referring now to an embodiment of a gaming system having augmented reality gaming capabilities is shown that includes data marks in the captured image. These data marks may be displayed at similar locations to calibration marks or ideally as in they may be embedded within a suitable graphic. In the embodiment shown in the data marks are the Dragon s eyes. In one aspect of a disclosed embodiment a data mark performs by temporally varying the intensity of the pixel s that compose it. From the player s perspective this varying of intensity appears as though the dragon s eyes are flickering. In contrast an actual flicker typically requires an encoded stream of data. A simple implementation uses a high intensity pixel to indicate a binary 1 and a low intensity pixel to indicate a binary 0. In some embodiments multiple data marks are used to increase data throughput.

By using calibration marks the overall geometry of the game LCD is known with respect to the camera image. From this geometry the expected position of the data marks may be derived. In some embodiments the data marks are utilized as a one way method of the game communicating with the augmented reality gaming application. In this manner the data marks may be used for the following purposes 1 The state of the game may be efficiently communicated e.g. during free spins the data marks may cause the phone to augment the display with extra graphical FX . 2 The game may provide secret hints to the player via their mobile phone with regard to choices to make during a game. Such features may be constructed such that the hints do not affect the overall hold over time or simply decrease the hold by a known amount. In one embodiment players may be targeted who have a consistent record of betting larger. 3 Game play statistics may be encrypted and sent via the data mark and augmented reality gaming application to a secure web service. These statistics may be collected by the manufacturer as an alternative means of collecting marketing data. Notably in most embodiments the phone application does not affect the outcome or operation of the underlying game since the communication is only one way.

In another embodiment of the gaming system having augmented reality gaming capabilities particular data marks provide a means for a gaming machine manufacturer to potentially track the deployment of games. Historically there have been problems in some markets of games and machines being resold without the manufacturer s consent. This may potentially result in copy protection methods being breached. Through the implementation of the disclosed gaming system a manufacturer may make use of the location awareness of a modern smart phone which then transmits the location of the phone along with data from the data mark which is capable of uniquely identifying the gaming machine. If the location of the gaming machine is found to be incorrect based upon sales records corrective action may be taken.

As noted above there are a number of methods for establishing an augmented reality gaming session using an embodiment of the disclosed gaming system. As shown in Bluetooth wireless technology may be used by installing a Bluetooth radio in the gaming machine and leveraging the existing Bluetooth capabilities of a standard smart phone. In this manner the selected gaming machine continually broadcasts to suitable Bluetooth devices using known Bluetooth discovery processes. When a handshake is made the gaming machine determines if the handshake is from the augmented reality gaming application or from another source. If the handshake is from another source the gaming machine sends a Bluetooth text message giving instructions on how to download the augmented reality gaming application.

Referring now to once the gaming system is in communication with the augmented reality gaming application the game information and state is sent to the application. This enables the augmented reality gaming application to display a menu such as shown in . In some embodiments updated state information may be continually sent by Bluetooth rather than by the use of data marks or OCR throughout the session. This configuration provides the advantage of using Bluetooth. However this benefit must be balanced against the potential downside of the communication being theoretically two way and thus harder to be approved by certain gaming regulators.

As described in an alternative to Bluetooth may be implemented using object recognition from a camera image. Specifically in such an embodiment the augmented reality gaming application which is loaded onto the player s smart phone asks the user to take a photo of the gaming machine. Through the use of known object recognition algorithms the name of the game may be extracted. Further information may also be obtained by OCR analysis of the camera image. Specifically the arrangement of symbols and the values of meters and other states are extracted from the camera image. Moreover for marketing purposes this data may be sent by the backend server or by the augmented reality gaming application via an SSL secure socket layer session to a secure manufacturer s web service.

Continuing in this embodiment once the state of the game is known an augmented state may be presented to the player via the display screen of the smart phone. For example in some embodiments where a player is given the choice of three boxes to open an arrow may appear on the mobile phone display pointing to the box that the player should favor. An example of an image capture from the process of is shown in . In this embodiment a player is playing a game called Burger Run. Referring now to a successful determination of the state results is shown in the content of the smart phone s display screen.

In this embodiment the smart phone s display screen presents a number of features to the player including by way of example only Game Rules Games Like This Progressive Info Secret Strategy and Download App. The Game Rules feature includes a standard pay table videos demonstrating the features present in the game and other general information. Selecting the Games Like This feature presents a list of games that were similar to a previously played game based upon denomination volatility and or other factors. The Progressive Info feature is described in further detail below. In some embodiments the Secret Strategy feature refers a player to one or more social networking sites where players may debate and propose strategies for the current game. The Secret Strategy feature may also provide context sensitive help that is overlaid at the correct position on the camera image as described above in to give the player the feeling that he may have an edge on the game. The Secret Strategy feature may also present time limited bonuses that are currently available at this gaming machine e.g. Power Winners promotions that are currently near the location of the smart phone .

In another aspect of some embodiments the Download App feature enables a player to download a fun version i.e. non gambling version of the game onto their phone. Otherwise stated in such an embodiment the gaming system having augmented reality gaming capabilities enables players to simply take a photo of games they wish to have on their smart phone and have them automatically downloaded for continued future use.

Referring again to the Progressive Info feature this feature is further illustrated in . Specifically illustrates a logic flow diagram of a process to present progressive rating. In one embodiment illustrates a smart phone in the process of acquiring progressive information for progressive value decoding. As with video poker the gaming system having augmented reality gaming capabilities enables a player to take a photo of a progressive game. Continuing as shown in the mobile phone application or the backend server analyzes the current state of the meters to determine the current favorability of playing the game. This analysis is done by using the known meter positions within the captured LCD image which may be derived by looking up the meter positions for a particular game once the game title itself has been derived using the processes in or .

In some embodiments the images at the meter positions are passed to an OCR Optical Character Recognition algorithm to determine the current progressive values. These values are then checked for sanity i.e. if the values read are out of range for what may be expected there may likely by either a problem with the image capture or with the installed progressive game . The values are then compared against their associated range and a rating is determined Otherwise stated a progressive may have a range with a maximum expected value of 100 and a minimum of 90. If the current value read is 99.50 one would expect this progressive to be likely triggered comparatively soon. This result would also cause a high rating to be given.

In another embodiment of the gaming system having augmented reality gaming capabilities if the progressive is open ended and does not have a maximum value then the rating may be determined based upon the theoretical hold of the game based upon its current progressive states. In this manner higher progressive values lead to a higher theoretical hold. In the case of multiple progressives each rating may be shown individually or combined into either an average or maximum rating. A maximum rating shows the rating of only the likeliest progressive to hit. Once determined the rating is shown to the player an example of which is shown in . In such an embodiment progressive games are given a rating equivalent to the widely known Homeland Security warning system. Like its security counterpart the rating may be configured such that the low rating is never chosen.

Notably the use of calibration marks or a Bluetooth for determining the gaming machine screen position and orientation in a captured image is not necessary. In some embodiments of the gaming system having augmented reality gaming capabilities the game title may be determined by OCR or object recognition. In this manner the fixed geometry and small set of possible images in a game may be used to quickly and accurately determine which game is present. Once the game title is determined the known structure of the game display may be used in place of calibration marks. For example in one embodiment the game shown in has touch screen buttons in the lower corners marked Cash Out and Spin which may be detected by object recognition and used as fixed points in the same way that the calibration marks would be used. Finally in still another embodiment techniques disclosed with respect to augmented reality gaming may be used as a way of augmenting a conventional stepper based game in the way that LCD overlays have been used. In this manner a complex winning line arrangement may be shown on the mobile phone screen.

Some preferred implementations of the disclosed embodiments use 1 a smart phone for the client 2 any suitable web server for communication with the smart phone and for the registration of players and 3 OpenCV image analysis software. Additionally some embodiments provide features that include by way of example only 1 new bonus concepts 2 quick intuitive processes for players to obtain help downloadable games or other enhancements 3 scale ability from no interaction with the game to full interaction with the game 4 delivering content to augment a regulated game with a comparatively unregulated mobile phone application which cannot affect the regulated game 5 leveraging existing technology and 6 requiring no new infrastructure. In other aspects some embodiments provide 1 the use of object recognition and OCR to deliver augmented content overlay of an existing game 2 the ability to overlay content based upon one way communication from gaming machine data marks and 3 a unique method of tracking potential license violations by casino users.

In another aspect of some embodiments gaming systems are utilized that include mobile gaming capabilities . In such embodiments of the disclosed gaming system smart phones are utilized that include built in object recognition technologies and OCR Optical character recognition techniques combined with location orientation derivation to provide players in casinos with additional gaming options and opportunities. In one embodiment of a gaming system that includes mobile gaming capabilities the gaming system leverages the possession by players of smart phones to enable the manufacturer to build profiles of players and target valuable players for promotions of key products of the manufacturer.

Referring now to the overall arrangement of the modules that make up an embodiment of a gaming system having mobile gaming capabilities is shown. In some embodiments of the gaming system having augmented reality gaming capabilities the gaming process proceeds in the following manner. A player downloads the iBonus application from an Application Store e.g. a gaming manufacturer s application store the Apple Application store the Goggle Application Store or the like onto their smart phone. The player uses the iBonus application to enroll in the iBonus system. The iBonus application then displays a list of targeted promotions.

In one embodiment a promotion may be Hit 3 Cash Spin symbols to win a free Cash Spin t shirt. The player then goes to the casino and plays Cash Spin. Once the player meets the requirements of the promotion such as by hitting a combination that includes three Cash Spin symbols the player takes out their phone selects the iBonus application and uses the builtin camera controlled by the iBonus application to take a photo of the game result. The iBonus Application securely transmits the photo to a web service where the photo is analyzed to confirm that the player has indeed met the terms of the promotion. Once confirmed the player is awarded the bonus by mail or electronically.

Referring now to an embodiment is shown that displays the general arrangement of logical modules in the gaming system having mobile gaming capabilities . These modules include by way of example only and not by way of limitation Player Value Tracking Player Registration Player Web Interface Bonus Match Bonus Award Bonus Rule Creation and Image Analysis.

Regarding the Player Value Tracking feature of the gaming system having mobile gaming capabilities as players register they are added to a database managed by the Player Value Tracking module. Initially a player is assigned a zero value. Otherwise stated the player will be offered bonuses available to all other players in their demographic such as location jurisdiction or age . As players participate in the bonus system their value may go up based upon their average bet and thus they may be offered higher value more targeted bonuses. The important difference between this module and a conventional player tracking system is that instead of each wager made by the player contributing to the value this system only tracks events captured by the mobile phone application which are generally bonus qualifying wins.

Referring now to the Player Registration feature of the gaming system having mobile gaming capabilities the player registration module handles the creation of new records for the Player Value Tracking system. Since fraud prevention is an important facet of the disclosed gaming system the player registration module generally requires some identification data to ensure that players do not register multiple accounts. A simple way to achieve this is to use an online service such as an online Application Store as a means of downloading the smart phone application. After being downloaded each application may be electronically fingerprinted so as to be tied to one smart phone account and or smart phone without requiring payment from the player.

Regarding the Player Web Interface feature of the gaming system having mobile gaming capabilities the player web interface provides some other important functionality in addition to providing a portal to the Player Registration module. Initially the web interface provides general advertising of the iBonus system and current promotions within. This advertising may also be accessed from the smart phone application. Furthermore the web interface provides the ability to push updates to the smart phone application. As an anti hacking measure the software and encryption keys on the smart phone are periodically updated to increase the cost of reverse engineering the communication protocol beyond the economic value of any bonuses fraudulently earned.

Referring now to the Bonus Match feature of the gaming system having mobile gaming capabilities once an image or image set has been analyzed to determine the state of the gaming machine at capture time the correct bonus to be awarded can be calculated. In this manner the Bonus Match module parses the list of possible bonuses to generate a list of matching bonuses. It is expected that each possible bonus record would include some or all of the following fields including but not limited to Type of bonus Game Identifier Game qualifying conditions Bet qualifying conditions Geographic restrictions Demographic restrictions Time restrictions and Quantity.

In some embodiments of the gaming system having mobile gaming capabilities the Type Of Bonus may be physical or virtual. A physical bonus may be an item such as a t shirt or a prepaid debit card while a virtual bonus may be loyalty points that can be redeemed for physical items or funds. In another aspect of some embodiments the Game Identifier is the name of the game being bonused. In still another aspect the Game Qualifying Conditions are the symbols or game state that must be matched. For example in one embodiment the symbol qualifying condition is 4 or more scatter symbols and a game state may be a win above 100. In yet another aspect the Bet Qualifying Conditions are a bonus that may be restricted to a minimum denomination and or other conditions such as a minimum number of lines played or a minimum total bet.

Continuing in some embodiments of the gaming system having mobile gaming capabilities the Geographic Restrictions file includes some combination of cell tower identifier reverse DNS lookup and GPS address to restrict the eligibility of some bonuses. In another aspect of some embodiments the Demographic Restrictions file includes some bonuses that are available to players in certain demographic groups such as age ranges. In still another aspect the Time Restrictions field includes bonuses that may be only available at certain times of the week or for a fixed length of time. Finally in yet another aspect of one embodiment the Quantity field includes the ability to set a limit on the number of redemptions before the bonus expires.

Desirably the combining of these attributes enables a manufacturer to generate some interesting promotion types. For example in some embodiments the manufacturer may choose to offer an ad hoc tournament to certain players. In such an embodiment the players are sent a message telling them for example that if the players play Cash Spin from 7 30 PM to 11 30 PM on Independence Day the first fifty players to hit the Cash Spin will be awarded an extra prize.

In another embodiment of the gaming system having mobile gaming capabilities tournaments are formed by having bonus awards predicated upon the highest wins by players participating over a period of time. For example in one embodiment the manufacturer sends a message to targeted players informing the players that the highest win on a Blazing 7s game between 8 00 PM and 9 00 PM on Tuesday will win a bonus of 1000. In such a scenario each player participating during this time would be encouraged to take photos of significant wins and at the end of the period the player with the highest win submitted would win the bonus. Notably as shown in the smart phone application may also be used to enter the tournament. Next updates would be pushed to all of the smart phones of the participating players every time the leader board changed thus enabling the players to monitor their positions in the tournament rankings. At the completion of the tournament any awards may be notified directly to players through the smart phone application.

Referring now to the Bonus Match Module interfaces with the Player Value Tracking module in that all data captured by the Bonus Match Module e.g. the arrangement of symbols denomination current credits played are passed to the Player Value Tracking module so that a history of interaction for each player may be generated. This data may be used to compute an average bet for a player and thus their value to casinos and also to determine the particular game types e.g. 1c high volatility that a player prefers to play.

Referring now to the Bonus Award module of the gaming system having mobile gaming capabilities this module performs the function of distributing awards to players. In one more basic embodiment players may be awarded physical awards such as t shirts or prepaid debit cards which may be mailed out to the players. In another aspect of some embodiments a loyalty points program is implemented that enables players to accumulate points to be redeemed for larger awards.

Regarding the Bonus Rule Creation feature of the gaming system having mobile gaming capabilities each bonus is constructed from a set of rules such as those described above. In some embodiments bonuses may be created from these rules by using a GUI graphical user interface . However in other embodiments Business Intelligence may be used to target the players who would benefit from some bonuses. In one such embodiment if a manufacturer launches Cash Spin 2 the manufacturer may target players who had previously won a bonus playing Cash Spin as being eligible for a special bonus opportunity.

Referring now to the Image Analysis module of the gaming system having mobile gaming capabilities the processes of this module are shown in . The image analysis module performs two major functions 1 determination of the arrangement of symbols present in the photo taken by the player and 2 detection of attempted fraud. In some embodiments the first task that the image analysis module performs upon receiving an image from the smart phone application is the extraction of the symbol matrix from the image. Standard image analysis techniques are utilized such as the OpenCV software library. In one aspect of this embodiment the image analysis has copies of all of the candidate symbol images that may be detected. From this library of images the arrangement of symbols on screen may be determined Notably in another embodiment manual intervention may be used. In such an embodiment a person located at a manufacturer s office quickly analyzes a photo and enters the arrangement of symbols into the Image Analysis system.

In another aspect of the gaming system having mobile gaming capabilities additional data may be sent from the smart phone to assist in automatic image analysis. The smart phone location i.e. geotag information may be used to narrow down the number of possible games against which to compare. Such a location may be determined by various combinations of the phone s GPS position IP address and or smart phone tower location.

Referring now to one embodiment of the gaming system is shown that illustrates how a gaming machine screen image may be processed from a photo taken by a smart phone camera. Initially the screen image is extracted. Next the screen image is transformed by a reverse perspective or keystone transformation.

In some embodiments to assist the keystone transformation of the image the orientation of the smart phone is determined by reading the smart phone s accelerometer values at the instant the image is captured. Typically the accelerometer values indicate orientation about the x y and z axis. While rotation about the vertical y axis is only useful if the orientation of the gaming machine cabinet is known which may be possible if the location of the camera is known precisely enough rotation about the x and z axis may be used to reduce the complexity of the transformation required given that the orientation of the gaming machine screen for a particular cabinet is a known constant about the x and z axis. In this manner reducing the transformation to one axis makes determining the best fit relatively straightforward. Once the extent of the gaming machine screen is determined in the image the angle of rotation of the top or bottom of the gaming machine screen from the horizontal is all that is needed to compute the reverse perspective transformation.

Furthermore also illustrates another feature of certain manufacturer specific games. In this feature the symbols constituting a win flash are otherwise animated in the event of a win. To compensate for the difficulty this may add to determining the arrangement of symbols the following steps are taken. Initially the Image Analysis module has access to every frame of animation of each animated symbol. In this manner each frame is used to compare against candidate sub images. Next the smart phone application takes multiple photos when the player presses the Take Picture or similar button. These photos are spaced in time such that at least a half a cycle of the known symbol flash time approximately ten frames or one third of a second elapses between consecutive captures. In the event that the symbol matrix cannot be determined from the first image captured the second and subsequent captures are used to fill in any blanks. In another aspect multiple image capture is also used as part of the fraud detection strategy described below.

Referring again to the image captured is analyzed to determine the state of the game with respect to the current denomination being played current play line configuration amount bet and credits available. These values are preferably determined by the use of known OCR Optical Character Recognition techniques in conjunction with templates available to the Image Analysis module. The Image Analysis module describes where on the primary gaming machine LCD screen the meter values may be expected to be located. Notably in another embodiment manual intervention may be used. In such an embodiment these values are extracted for the purpose of ensuring that bonus conditions may be met to help prevent fraud as described in further detail below and for passing to the Player Value Tracking system.

In the embodiment shown in since the game is known to have progressive meters displayed on the screen these meters are also extracted. Once the symbol matrix and meter values have been determined they are passed along with any geographic identification to the Bonus Match module. If no bonus condition has been met the player is informed accordingly. In the event that the symbol matrix was not captured correctly this gives the player another chance to take a photo.

In another aspect of the gaming system having mobile gaming capabilities if a bonus condition has been met the image s is further analyzed for the purposes of player value tracking and fraud detection. Typically the first task of the fraud detection method is the analysis of the symbol matrix to ensure that the matrix is valid. One non limiting embodiment is illustrated by the following result 

In this non limiting exemplary embodiment a player is eligible for a bonus if the player has four Kings in a line. However the player is only awarded the bonus in this scenario if they have elected to play at least two lines. Furthermore the following checks are performed to prevent a hacker trying to subvert the process.

In the first hacker prevention step each of the reel segments is compared against every legal reel strip for this particular game to ensure that they are possible. For example if there is no known reel strip for reel 4 that contains a sequence of KING KING SEVEN then this configuration may be identified as illegal. Accordingly a suspicious notification may be generated. In another aspect games may have different reel strips in different jurisdictions which in conjunction with the known geographic position of the smart phone may be used to limit the possible legal strips. If the reel segments are found to be valid the game configuration in terms of hold may also be determined to be valid. As such the game configuration may be passed as data to the Player Value Tracking module for later business intelligence methods with respect to the evaluation of the success of different holds for games.

In the second hacker prevention step the winning amount won by the player as represented on the screen and extracted above along with the associated bet value is validated against the known pay table to ensure the winning amount has not been faked. Continuing in the next hacker prevention step the progressive meters if present are compared against the known legal ranges. In the case of wide area progressives where the values of the progressives are known for a given time the time stamp of the image is used to determine the expected progressive values. If the progressive meter values are not within a small range of these expected values the bonus may be flagged as suspicious.

Finally in yet another hacker prevention step relating to a scenario in which multiple image captures are taken each image is analyzed in turn to ensure that it is consistent with a correct set of animations for the game result. For example if it is expected that a winning symbol would flash at a certain rate the bonus can be flagged as suspicious if this flash is not present in the image and or the sequence is not captured at the correct rate.

If an image passes all of these above described hacker prevention checks the system will likely conclude that an image has been taken off a legal bonus. A further set of checks are also performed however to guard against replay attacks. A replay attack occurs when an unscrupulous person takes multiple photos of the bonus triggering game result and submits the photos as multiple entries thereby attempting to earn multiple awards.

In some embodiments the gaming system guards against replay attack by comparing the following data obtained from the image against other bonus redemptions for the same game. Such data includes the arrangement of the symbol matrix the values of the credit denomination bet and win meters and progressive meters and the time and geographic location of the bonus being submitted. Regarding the arrangement of the symbol matrix the odds of two persons hitting the same exact arrangement of paying and non paying symbols is actually quite high i.e. in the hundreds of thousands if not millions to one for most reasonably high paying game outcomes. With respect to the values of the credit denomination bet and win meters and progressive meters if present it is highly unlikely that two bonus winners would have identical values for all of these. Lastly regarding the time and geographic location of the bonus being submitted it is highly unlikely that the same winning result would be achieved at the same place and close to the same time. When taken in combination it is mathematically clear that if two bonus images are submitted that match all of the above it is likely that fraudulent behavior is the cause of such a result. Once an award attempt passes these hacker prevention checks the Bonus Award module is signaled to award the bonus and the smart phone application is signaled to inform the player that the award has been earned.

As described above various strategies may be performed to prevent replay attacks against the gaming system in which a number of identical submissions are made by one or more players at a similar time. In this type of fraud when a player wins in addition to the winning player submitting their photo one or more other people around the winning player also take photos of the screen in an attempt to try and also get the prize. Normally only the first submission of a group of identical game results is awarded the prize with the subsequent submissions being denied.

In another fraud attempt scenario a player wins a prize on a gaming machine but before the winning player has a chance to get their phone out another person behind the winning player or at an adjacent gaming machine takes a photo of the winning game screen and submits the photo. To prevent this type of fraud in a case where multiple submissions are received by the gaming system if the first submission is taken at a much further distance or at a significantly more acute angle as measured by the perspective distortion of the captured image of the reels to a second submission then the later submission is determined to be the valid one. This analysis may be performed either automatically or more preferably with human interaction.

Referring now to the smart phone application of the gaming system having mobile gaming capabilities the smart phone application is comprised of a number of smaller modules. In some embodiments the smart phone application has a user interface that interfaces with the Player Web Interface module. This enables the smart phone application to provide periodic updates with new offers which may be targeted to the player.

In another aspect the application also includes an image capture module. The image capture module is activated by the player upon them pressing the Take Picture button for a particular offer. In some embodiments the image capture module controls the in built camera on the smart phone and displays a copy of the current camera captured image on the phone s display much like a conventional camera application. Additionally a button is also presented to the player to be pressed when the display of the gaming machine is roughly centered in the camera view. In another embodiment no button is used and image analysis algorithms built into the capture module detect the presence of game symbols in the camera view and immediately begin capturing images. The presence of game meters read by OCR or a physical barcode sticker may be used to automatically begin capturing images.

In some preferred implementations of the gaming system having mobile gaming capabilities the image capture module reads the values of the accelerometers from the phone and does not capture images unless the phone is relatively stable i.e. only small amounts of acceleration detected . This assists the player in making a good image capture in the low in door light of a casino. In some embodiments the auto focus algorithms of the phone s camera only allow photos to be taken that are sharp. Additionally as each image is taken it may be analyzed using box filters and Fourier transforms to detect the overall sharpness of the image. The application may also take multiple image captures until an image is taken that is suitably sharp and contains recognizable data such as meter values in acceptable areas of the image.

In one embodiment of the gaming system having mobile gaming capabilities when a player wishes to submit a result the player activates the capture function. After activation the player starts to receive a live feed of the images being received by the phone s camera on the phone s display which allows the player to see what they are about to capture. For example as shown in a live camera image of a gaming machine screen is displayed. Referring next to alignment boxes may be seen that are used by the player to overlay onto the live camera image. shows the alignment boxes overlaid onto the live camera image that was displayed in in the manner of a heads up display.

One purpose of the alignment boxes is to make it very easy for a player to know how to align his camera. Another purpose of the alignment boxes is to ensure that other data such as meter values will also be captured for hacker detection or player tracking purposes. In this manner the alignment boxes are sized dependent upon the individual game and are small enough to ensure the data around the reels is also captured. Notably the three alignment box example shown in is a single non limiting example. In other embodiments one large box encompassing all three reels may be used. In still another embodiment a cross hair graphic may be utilized that is aligned with the center of the middle reel.

In another aspect of the gaming system the Image Encoder module in the smart phone application encodes the image for transmission to the Image Analysis Module. Since the link between the Image Analysis module and the mobile phone is over a public data network such as the internet in some embodiments it is important that all communication is encrypted. Furthermore public key encryption may be used with server applications only permitting the connection from phones that can prove to be authorized to participate in the bonus system by means of a digital signature. To prevent hacking it is preferred that the smart phone application platform be relatively secure with the application only being distributed through authorized channels such as the smart phone manufacturer s Application store or the gaming machines manufacturer s website. In some embodiments of the gaming system encryption keys and methods are periodically updated to make it more difficult for a hacker to insert their own images into the system. Along with the fraud detection methods disclosed above these hacker prevention modules are configured to make the risk of significant loss very low.

An alternative for players who do not have access to a smart phone is that casinos or bars may be supplied with phones capable of running the mobile phone application. In the event of a qualifying win the player calls for assistance and has an attendant or bartender perform the photo verification process.

In some embodiments of the disclosed gaming system players may use their smart phone to take a photo of the machine and obtain access to the following capabilities a Tournament across venues e.g. each player signs in time limited and the like b take a photo of a game or barcode to download a mobile application version of the game c obtain a free copy of the mobile game for winning some trivial amount which ensures players play a game a minimum amount of time and d take a photo of a game to see what gaming machine manufacturer offers are available.

Some preferred implementations of the disclosed embodiments use 1 a smart phone for the client 2 any suitable web server for communication with the smart phone and registration of players and 3 OpenCV image analysis software. Additionally some embodiments provide features that include by way of example only 1 alternative player tracking bonusing and a marketing method for gaming manufacturers 2 the capabilities to work with existing games without requiring any modification and 3 leveraging existing smart mobile phone infrastructure. In other aspects some embodiments provide 1 detection of a win by image analysis without any access to game code 2 detection of fraudulent entries by analysis of symbols displayed meters on the screen location and time of image taken 3 capture of multiple images to prevent fraud and also more accurately detect wins 4 alternative method of determining player value e.g. using win amounts instead of using coin in 5 enabling the addition of ad hoc tournaments to existing games and 6 enabling the targeted marketing of new games for valuable players.

The additional displays may or may not include a touch screen or touch glass system.

Referring to electronic gaming machine is shown in accordance with one or more embodiments. Electronic gaming machine includes base game integrated circuit board EGM Processor Board connected through serial bus line to game monitoring unit GMU such as a Bally MC300 or ACSC NT and player interface integrated circuit board PIB connected to player interface devices over bus lines . Printer is connected to PIB and GMU over bus lines . EGM Processor Board PIB and GMU connect to Ethernet switch over bus lines . Ethernet switch connects to a slot management system SMS and a casino management system CMS network over bus line . GMU also may connect to the SMS and CMS network over bus line . Speakers connect through audio mixer and bus lines to EGM Processor Board and PIB . The proximity and biometric devices and circuitry may be installed by upgrading a commercially available PIB such as a Bally iVIEW unit. Coding executed on EGM Processor Board PID and or GMU may be upgraded to integrate a game having an interactive wheel game as is more fully described herein.

Peripherals connect through bus to EGM Processor Board . For example a bill ticket acceptor is typically connected to a game input output board which is in turn connected to a conventional central processing unit CPU board such as an Intel Pentium microprocessor mounted on a gaming motherboard. I O board may be connected to CPU processor board by a serial connection such as RS 232 or USB or may be attached to the processor by a bus such as but not limited to an ISA bus. The gaming motherboard may be mounted with other conventional components such as are found on conventional personal computer motherboards and loaded with a game program which may include a gaming machine operating system OS such as a Bally Alpha OS. Processor board executes a game program that causes processor board to play a game. In one embodiment the game program provides a slot machine game having an interactive wheel feature game. The various components and included devices may be installed with conventionally and or commercially available components devices and circuitry into a conventionally and or commercially available gaming machine cabinet examples of which are described above.

When a player has inserted a form of currency such as for example and without limitation paper currency coins or tokens cashless tickets or vouchers electronic funds transfers or the like into the currency acceptor a signal is sent by way of I O board to processor board which in turn assigns an appropriate number of credits for play in accordance with the game program. The player may further control the operation of the gaming machine by way of other peripherals for example to select the amount to wager via electromechanical or touch screen buttons. The game starts in response to the player operating a start mechanism such as a handle or touch screen icon.

The game program includes a random number generator to provide a display of randomly selected indicia on one or more displays. In some embodiments the random number generator may be physically separate from gaming machine . For example it may be part of a central determination host system which provides random game outcomes to the game program. Thereafter the player may or may not interact with the game through electromechanical or touch screen buttons to change the displayed indicia. Finally processor board under control of the game program and OS compares the final display of indicia to a pay table. The set of possible game outcomes may include a subset of outcomes related to the triggering of a feature game. In the event the displayed outcome is a member of this subset processor board under control of the game program and by way of I O Board may cause feature game play to be presented on a feature display.

Predetermined payout amounts for certain outcomes including feature game outcomes are stored as part of the game program.

In various embodiments the game program is stored in a memory device not shown connected to or mounted on the gaming motherboard. By way of example but not by limitation such memory devices include external memory devices hard drives CD ROMs DVDs and flash memory cards. In an alternative embodiment the game programs are stored in a remote storage device. In one embodiment the remote storage device is housed in a remote server. The gaming machine may access the remote storage device via a network connection including but not limited to a local area network connection a TCP IP connection a wireless connection or any other means for operatively networking components together. Optionally other data including graphics sound files and other media data for use with the EGM are stored in the same or a separate memory device not shown . Some or all of the game program and its associated data may be loaded from one memory device into another for example from flash memory to random access memory RAM .

In one or more embodiments peripherals may be connected to the system over Ethernet connections directly to the appropriate server or tied to the system controller inside the EGM using USB serial or Ethernet connections. Each of the respective devices may have upgrades to their firmware utilizing these connections.

GMU includes an integrated circuit board a GMU processor and memory including coding for network communications such as the G2S game to system protocol from the Gaming Standards Association Las Vegas Nev. used for system communications over the network. As shown GMU may connect to card reader through bus and may thereby obtain player card information and transmit the information over the network through bus . Gaming activity information may be transferred by the EGM Processor Board to GMU where the information may be translated into a network protocol such as S2S for transmission to a server such as a player tracking server where information about a player s playing activity may be stored in a designated server database.

PID includes an integrated circuit board PID processor and memory which includes an operating system such as Windows CE a player interface program which may be executable by the PID processor together with various input output I O drivers for respective devices which connect to PID such as player interface devices and which may further include various games or game components playable on PID or playable on a connected network server and PID which is operable as the player interface. PID connects to card reader through bus display through video decoder and bus such as an LVDS or VGA bus.

As part of its programming the PID processor executes coding to drive display and provides messages and information to a player. Touch screen circuitry interactively connects display and video decoder to PID such that a player may input information and cause the information to be transmitted to PID either on the player s initiative or responsive to a query by PID . Additionally soft keys connects through bus to PID and operates together with display to provide information or queries to a player and receive responses or queries from the player. PID in turn communicates over the CMS SMS network through Ethernet switch and busses and with respective servers such as a player tracking server.

Player interface devices are linked into the virtual private network of the system components in gaming machine . The system components include the iVIEW processing board and game monitoring unit GMU processing board. These system components may connect over a network to the slot management system such as a commercially available Bally SDS SMS and or casino management system such as a commercially available Bally CMP CMS .

The GMU system component has a connection to the base game through a serial SAS connection and is connected to various servers using for example HTTPs over Ethernet. Through this connection firmware media operating system software or gaming machine configurations can be downloaded to the system components from the servers. This data is authenticated prior to installation on the system components.

The system components include the iVIEW processing board and game monitoring unit GMU processing board. The GMU and iVIEW can be combined into one like the commercially available Bally G iVIEW device. This device may have a video mixing technology to mix the EGM processor s video signals with the iVIEW display onto the top box monitor or any monitor on the gaming device.

In accordance with one or more embodiments is a functional block diagram of a gaming kernel of a game program under control of processor board using gaming kernel by calling it into application programming interface API which is part of game manager . The components of game kernel as shown in are only illustrative and should not be considered limiting. For example the number of managers may be changed additional managers may be added or some managers may be removed without deviating from the scope and spirit of the disclosed system.

As shown in the example there are three layers a hardware layer an operating system layer such as but not limited to Linux and a game kernel layer having game manager therein. In one or more embodiments the use of a standard operating system such a UNIX based or Windows based operating system allows game developers interfacing to the gaming kernel to use any of a number of standard development tools and environments available for the operating systems. This is in contrast to the use of proprietary low level interfaces which may require significant time and engineering investments for each game upgrade hardware upgrade or feature upgrade. The game kernel layer executes at the user level of the operating system and itself contains a major component called the I O Board Server . To properly set the bounds of game application software making integrity checking easier all game applications interact with gaming kernel using a single API in game manager . This enables game applications to make use of a well defined consistent interface as well as making access points to gaming kernel controlled where overall access is controlled using separate processes.

For example game manager parses an incoming command stream and when a command dealing with I O comes in arrow the command is sent to an applicable library routine . Library routine decides what it needs from a device and sends commands to I O Board Server see arrow . A few specific drivers remain in operating system s kernel shown as those below line . These are built in primitive or privileged drivers that are i general ii kept to a minimum and iii easier to leave than extract. In such cases the low level communications is handled within operating system and the contents is passed to library routines .

Thus in a few cases library routines may interact with drivers inside operating system which is why arrow is shown as having three directions between library utilities and I O Board Server or between library utilities and certain drivers in operating system . No matter which path is taken the logic needed to work with each device is coded into modules in the user layer of the diagram. Operating system is kept as simple stripped down and common across as many hardware platforms as possible. The library utilities and user level drivers change as dictated by the game cabinet or game machine in which it will run. Thus each game cabinet or game machine may have an industry standard processor board connected to a unique relatively dumb and as inexpensive as possible I O adapter board plus a gaming kernel which will have the game machine unique library routines and I O Board Server components needed to enable game applications to interact with the gaming machine cabinet. Note that these differences are invisible to the game application software with the exception of certain functional differences i.e. if a gaming cabinet has stereo sound the game application will be able to make use of API to use the capability over that of a cabinet having traditional monaural sound .

Game manager provides an interface into game kernel providing consistent predictable and backwards compatible calling methods syntax and capabilities by way of game application API . This enables the game developer to be free of dealing directly with the hardware including the freedom to not have to deal with low level drivers as well as the freedom to not have to program lower level managers although lower level managers may be accessible through game manager s interface if a programmer has the need. In addition to the freedom derived from not having to deal with the hardware level drivers and the freedom of having consistent callable object oriented interfaces to software managers of those components drivers game manager provides access to a set of upper level managers also having the advantages of consistent callable object oriented interfaces and further providing the types and kinds of base functionality required in casino type games. Game manager providing all the advantages of its consistent and richly functional interface as supported by the rest of game kernel thus provides a game developer with a multitude of advantages.

Game manager may have several objects within itself including an initialization object not shown . The initialization object performs the initialization of the entire game machine including other objects after game manager has started its internal objects and servers in appropriate order. In order to carry out this function the kernel s configuration manager is among the first objects to be started. The configuration manager has the data needed to initialize and correctly configure other objects or servers.

The upper level managers of game kernel may include game event log manager which provides at the least a logging or logger base class enabling other logging objects to be derived from this base object. The logger object is a generic logger. Otherwise stated the logger object is not aware of the contents of logged messages and events. The log manager s job is to log events in non volatile event log space. The size of the space may be fixed although the size of the logged event is typically not. When the event space or log space fills up one embodiment deletes the oldest logged event each logged event has a time date stamp as well as other needed information such as length providing space to record the new event. In this embodiment the most recent events are found in the log space regardless of their relative importance. Further provided is the capability to read the stored logs for event review.

In accordance with one embodiment meter manager manages the various meters embodied in the game kernel . This includes the accounting information for the game machine and game play. There are hard meters counters and soft meters. The soft meters may be stored in non volatile storage such as non volatile battery backed RAM to prevent loss. Further a backup copy of the soft meters may be stored in a separate non volatile storage such as EEPROM. In one embodiment meter manager receives its initialization data for the meters during startup from configuration manager . While running the cash in and cash out managers call the meter manager s update functions to update the meters. Meter manager will on occasion create backup copies of the soft meters by storing the soft meters readings in EEPROM. This is accomplished by calling and using EEPROM manager .

In accordance with still other embodiments progressive manager manages progressive games playable from the game machine. Event manager is generic like log manager and is used to manage various gaming machine events. Focus manager correlates which process has control of various focus items. Tilt manager is an object that receives a list of errors if any from configuration manager at initialization and during game play from processes managers drivers and the like that may generate errors. A random number generator manager is provided to allow easy programming access to a random number generator RNG as an RNG is required in virtually all casino style gambling games. The RNG manager includes the capability of using multiple seeds.

In accordance with one or more embodiments a credit manager object not shown manages the current state of credits cash value or cash equivalent in the game machine including any available winnings and further provides denomination conversion services. Cash out manager has the responsibility of configuring and managing monetary output devices. During initialization cash out manager using data from configuration manager sets the cash out devices correctly and selects any selectable cash out denominations. During play a game application may post a cash out event through the event manager the same way all events are handled and using a callback posted by cash out manager and cash out manager is informed of the event. Cash out manager updates the credit object updates its state in non volatile memory and sends an appropriate control message to the device manager that corresponds to the dispensing device. As the device dispenses dispensable media there typically are event messages being sent back and forth between the device and cash out manager until the dispensing finishes. After the dispensing finishes the cash out manager having updated the credit manager and any other game state such as some associated with meter manager that needs to be updated for this set of actions sends a cash out completion event to event manager and to the game application thereby. The cash in manager functions similarly to cash out manager addressing requirements for controlling interfacing and managing actions associated with cashing in events cash in devices and associated meters and crediting.

In a further example in accordance with one or more embodiments I O server may write data to the gaming machine EEPROM memory which is located in the gaming machine cabinet and holds meter storage that must be kept even in the event of power failure. Game manager calls the I O library functions to write data to the EEPROM. The I O server receives the request and starts a low priority EEPROM thread within I O server to write the data. This thread uses a sequence of an 8 bit command and data writes to the EEPROM device to write the appropriate data in the proper location within the device. Any errors detected are sent as IPC messages to game manager . Preferably all of this processing is asynchronously performed.

In accordance with one embodiment button module within I O server polls or is sent the state of buttons every two milliseconds. These inputs are debounced by keeping a history of input samples. Certain sequences of samples are required to detect a button was pressed in which case the I O server sends an inter process communication event to game manager that a button was pressed or released. In some embodiments the gaming machine may have intelligently distributed I O which debounces the buttons in which case button module may be able to communicate with the remote intelligent button processor to retrieve the button events and simply relay them to game manager via IPC messages. In still another embodiment the I O library may be used for pay out requests from the game application. For example hopper module must start the hopper motor constantly monitoring the coin sensing lines of the hopper debounce them and send an IPC message to the game manager when each coin is paid.
