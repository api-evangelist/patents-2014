The present disclosure relates generally to shaped charges. More particularly the present disclosure relates to a user configurable shape charge liner and housing.

A shaped charge is an explosive charge shaped to focus the effect of the explosive s energy. Various types are used to cut and form metal initiate nuclear weapons penetrate armor complete wells in the oil and gas industry Explosive Ordnance Disposal EOD and the like. A typical device includes a solid cylinder of explosive with a metal lined conical hollow in one end and a central detonator array of detonators or detonation wave guide at the other end. Explosive energy is released directly away from normal to the surface of an explosive so shaping the explosive will concentrate the explosive energy in the void. If the hollow is properly shaped usually conically the enormous pressure generated by the detonation of the explosive drives the liner in the hollow cavity inward to collapse upon its central axis. The resulting collision forms and projects a high velocity jet of metal particles forward along the axis. Most of the jet material originates from the innermost part of the liner a layer of about 10 to 20 of the thickness. The rest of the liner forms a slower moving slug of material which because of its appearance is sometimes called a carrot . Because of the variation along the liner in its collapse velocity the jet s velocity also varies along its length decreasing from the front. This variation in jet velocity stretches it and eventually leads to its break up into particles. Over time the particles tend to fall out of alignment which reduces the depth of penetration at long standoffs.

Shaped charges can be varied based on their diameter which determines penetration and angle of the liner which determines the jet speed . In general shaped charges may penetrate a steel plate as thick as 150 to 700 of their diameter depending on the charge quality. The most common shape of the liner is conical with an internal apex angle of 40 to 90 degrees. Different apex angles yield different distributions of jet mass and velocity. Small apex angles may result in jet bifurcation or even in the failure of the jet to form at all this is attributed to the collapse velocity being above a certain threshold normally slightly higher than the liner material s bulk sound speed. Other widely used shapes include hemispheres tulips trumpets ellipses and bi conics the various shapes yield jets with different velocity and mass distributions.

Conventional shaped charge liners e.g. cones are fixed shape diameter and size angle and manufactured as a fixed item with a same metallic material. One problem is these are bulky and hard to carry. Another problem is they do not allow modification in the field in terms of size or metals. Also shape housings are also bulky tubes and difficult to carry. It would be advantageous to have a user configurable shape charge liner and housing that is configurable in the field easy to transport and deployable with different materials as needed.

In an exemplary embodiment a configurable shape charge liner includes a cone wherein the cone is hollow and comprising a cone bottom portion comprising a cone bottom diameter and one or more circular ring sections. Each of the one or more circular rings sections are hollow and comprise a circular ring section top diameter and a circular ring section bottom diameter. The circular ring section top diameter is less than smaller than the circular ring section bottom diameter. The cone and one or more circular ring sections are connectable therebetween to form different overall diameters for the configurable shape charge liner. The configurable shape charge liner includes a conical shape.

In various exemplary embodiments the present disclosure relates generally to a User Configurable Shape Charge Liner UCSCL and Housing. This disclosure addresses the aforementioned limitations by being modular easily packable and configurable in the field. The User Configurable Shape Charge Liner UCSCL is a modular liner that may be built with the same common components into a 1 2 3 and 4 inch for example diameter shape charge. Its components may be made of several different materials such as copper magnesium zirconium glass metal alloys or other suitable materials which may be mixed and matched within the same shape charge cone to provide tailored effects.

Referring to in an exemplary embodiment a perspective diagram illustrates a User Configurable Shape Charge Liner UCSCL . The UCSCL includes various sections including a cone a first circular ring a second circular ring and a third circular ring . The cone and the circular rings are configured to connect to one another and form a larger cone that is a shape charge liner. Note while the UCSCL is described herein with four exemplary parts this is for illustration purposes and those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize more or less parts may be used to make the shape charge liner.

The UCSCL allows a user in the field for example a dismounted warfighter the ability to tailor shape charge diameter and effects. The modular liner approach allows each shape charge jet to contain several mixed effects between copper magnesium zirconium and glass metal alloys i.e. copper for penetration followed by magnesium or zirconium for thermal effects. That is each of the cone and the circular rings may be any of copper magnesium zirconium and glass metal alloys in a configurable manner as desired for different effects. A key aspect of the UCSCL is that the shaped charge liner is not manufactured as a single piece but connectable sections which may be different materials.

Referring to in exemplary embodiments perspective diagrams illustrate various views of the cone the first circular ring the second circular ring and the third circular ring . In the cone includes a height and a diameter . Also the cone includes a hollow portion . The cone forms the top of the UCSCL . In an exemplary embodiment the diameter is about 1 although other values are contemplated. The cone includes a bottom portion and a point at the top. For example in the field if a user needs a 1 diameter shape charge liner the user can only use the cone .

In the first circular ring includes a height a top diameter and a bottom diameter . Also the first circular ring includes a hollow portion . The top diameter is less than the bottom diameter . The first circular ring includes a top portion with the top diameter and a bottom portion with the bottom diameter and the hollow portion is open between the top portion and the bottom portion . The first circular ring is configured to interconnect with the cone . For example the bottom portion of the cone may interconnect with the top portion of the first circular ring . Any interconnection mechanism is contemplated such as a twist lock tongue and groove etc. Specifically the diameter of the cone is about the same as the top diameter of the first circular ring . In an exemplary embodiment the top diameter is about 1 and the bottom diameter is about 2 although other values are contemplated. For example in the field if a user needs a 2 diameter shape charge liner the user may connect the first circular ring to the cone . Also the first circular ring may be the same or a different material from the cone .

In the second circular ring includes a height a top diameter and a bottom diameter . Also the second circular ring includes a hollow portion . The top diameter is less smaller than the bottom diameter . The second circular ring includes a top portion with the top diameter and a bottom portion with the bottom diameter and the hollow portion is open between the top portion and the bottom portion . The second circular ring is configured to interconnect with the first circular ring . For example the bottom portion of the first circular ring may interconnect with the top portion of the second circular ring . Any interconnection mechanism is contemplated such as a twist lock tongue and groove etc. Specifically the top diameter of the second circular ring is about the same as the bottom diameter of the first circular ring . In an exemplary embodiment the top diameter is about 2 and the bottom diameter is about 3 although other values are contemplated. For example in the field if a user needs a 3 diameter shape charge liner the user may connect the first circular ring to the cone and connect the second circular ring to the first circular ring . Also the second circular ring may be the same or a different material from the cone and or the first circular ring .

In the third circular ring includes a height a top diameter and a bottom diameter . Also the third circular ring includes a hollow portion . The top diameter is less smaller than the bottom diameter . The third circular ring includes a top portion with the top diameter and a bottom portion with the bottom diameter and the hollow portion is open between the top portion and the bottom portion . The third circular ring is configured to interconnect with the second circular ring . For example the bottom portion of the second circular ring may interconnect with the top portion of the third circular ring . Any interconnection mechanism is contemplated such as twist lock tongue and groove etc. Specifically the top diameter of the third circular ring is about the same as the bottom diameter of the second circular ring. In an exemplary embodiment the top diameter is about 3 and the bottom diameter is about 4 although other values are contemplated. For example in the field if a user needs a 4 diameter shape charge liner the user may connect the first circular ring to the cone connect the second circular ring to the first circular ring and connect the third circular ring to the second circular ring . Also the third circular ring may be the same or a different material from the cone the first circular ring and or the second circular ring .

Note each of the cone and the rings are angled which forms the overall angle of the UCSCL . The diameter of the UCSCL is configurable based on how many of the rings are used. In the exemplary embodiments the UCSCL may have a diameter of about 1 2 3 or 4 although other values are contemplated with more rings or differing sized rings. The UCSCL may also have different angles as required. The overall UCSCL may be different angles or the user may configure different angles in the cone by using different rings i.e. you could start with one angle and finish with another it would be like a trumpet .

Two exemplary aspects of the UCSCL include improved manufacturing through lower cost easier manufacturing and less waste and improve carrying ability. With respect to the manufacturing the rings may be cut out of pipe or the like. The UCSCL does not have to be machined as one piece but as the separate field configurable parts. The back half of the liner may be inverted into the front half thereby creating a conical liner that produces linear cuts in a circular pattern.

With respect to carrying ability referring to in exemplary embodiments perspective views illustrate the UCSCL in a stored state. illustrates the UCSCL in a stacked configuration where the second circular ring is placed within the hollow section of the third circular ring the first circular ring is placed within the hollow section of the second circular ring and the cone is placed within the hollow section of the first circular ring . Note the overall carrying size of the UCSCL is no bigger than the largest of the heights and the diameter . This configuration is a significant improvement over a full cone shape and much easier for EOD personnel to carry in backpacks.

Another advantage of the UCSCL is that the different parts may be composed of different materials interchangeably for different charge diameters and effects. Liners have been made from many materials including various metals and glass. In an exemplary embodiment the deepest penetrations are achieved with a dense ductile metal and a very common choice has been copper. In other exemplary embodiments for some modern anti armor weapons molybdenum and pseudo alloys of tungsten filler and copper binder 9 1 thus density is 18 Mg m3 have been adopted. The cone and the ring sections may be any common metallic element including aluminum tungsten tantalum depleted uranium lead tin cadmium cobalt magnesium titanium zinc zirconium molybdenum beryllium nickel silver and even gold and platinum. The selection of the material depends on the target to be penetrated for example aluminum has been found advantageous for concrete targets. Copper is used as a liner material for antitank and tantalum is superior to copper due to its much higher density and very high ductility at high strain rates. Other high density metals and alloys tend to have drawbacks in terms of price toxicity radioactivity or lack of ductility.

For the deepest penetrations pure metals generally yield the best results because they display the greatest ductility which delays the breakup of the jet into particles as it stretches. In charges for oil well completion however it is essential that a solid slug or carrot not be formed as it would plug the hole just penetrated and interfere with the influx of oil. In the petroleum industry therefore liners are generally fabricated by powder metallurgy often of pseudo alloys which if unsintered yield jets that are composed mainly of dispersed fine metal particles.

Unsintered cold pressed liners however are not waterproof and tend to be brittle which makes them easy to damage during handling which is an advantage here due to the compact carrying size this can overcome the potential damage. Bimetallic liners usually zinc lined copper may be used. During jet formation the zinc layer vaporizes and a slug is not formed. The disadvantage is an increased cost and dependency of jet formation on the quality of bonding the two layers. Low melting point below 500 C. solder braze like alloys e.g. Sn50Pb50 Zn97.6Pb1.6 or pure metals like lead zinc or cadmium may be used. These materials melt before reaching the well casing and the molten metal does not obstruct the hole. Other alloys binary eutectics e.g. Pb88.8Sb11.1 Sn61.9Pd38.1 or Ag71.9Cu28.1 form a metal matrix composite material with ductile matrix with brittle dendrites such materials reduce slug formation but are difficult to shape.

A metal matrix composite with discrete inclusions of low melting material is another option. The inclusions either melt before the jet reaches the well casing weakening the material or serve as crack nucleation sites and the slug breaks up on impact. The dispersion of the second phase may be achieved also with castable alloys e.g. copper with a low melting point metal insoluble in copper such as bismuth 1 5 lithium or up to 50 usually 15 30 lead the size of inclusions can be adjusted by thermal treatment. Non homogeneous distribution of the inclusions may also be achieved. Other additives may modify the alloy properties tin 4 8 nickel up to 30 and often together with tin up to 8 aluminum phosphorus forming brittle phosphides or 1 5 silicon form brittle inclusions serving as crack initiation sites. Up to 30 zinc may be added to lower the material cost and to form additional brittle phases.

Oxide glass liners produce jets of low density therefore yielding less penetration depth. Double layer liners with one layer of a less dense but pyrophoric metal e.g. aluminum or magnesium may be used to enhance incendiary effects following the armor piercing action. Explosive welding may be used for making those as then the metal metal interface is homogeneous does not contain significant amount of intermetallics and does not have adverse effects to the formation of the jet.

The penetration depth is proportional to the maximum length of the jet which is a product of the jet tip velocity and time to particulation. The jet tip velocity depends on bulk sound velocity in the liner material the time to particulation is dependent on the ductility of the material. The maximum achievable jet velocity is roughly 2.34 times the sound velocity in the material. The speed can reach 10 km s peaking some 40 microseconds after detonation the cone tip is subjected to acceleration of about 25 million g. The jet tail reaches about 2 5 km s. The pressure between the jet tip and the target may reach one terapascal. The immense pressure makes the metal flow like a liquid though x ray diffraction has shown the metal stays solid one of the theories explaining this behavior proposes molten core and solid sheath of the jet. The best materials are face centered cubic metals as they are the most ductile but even graphite and zero ductility ceramic cones show significant penetration.

Referring to in an exemplary embodiment perspective views illustrate a container or housing for a User Configurable Charge System UCCS . The UCCS is a flexible housing material in a roll or sheet of user indexable material. The user tears off a specific needed amount of a specific diameter or configuration for use as the container for a field packable shape charge capable of creating various diameters i.e. the UCSCL . The applicable UCSCL is chosen and inserted into the plastic user indexable housing the UCCS . The appropriate length corresponding to the required diameter of the flexible UCCS housing is then filled with explosives generally C 4 in order to make the UCCS shape charge module which may be made longer by snapping them together. A rigid ring which may either be used to gang or connect several UCCS modules together including empty housings for use as stand off or mounting fixtures or as the interface for a back plate is used to attach the method of ignition detonation or detonator and is snapped onto the back of the charge. This ring provides for rigidity and as an interface for mounting of sighting devices or the UCCS itself. The UCCS is also easy to carry as it may be rolled up or flat.

Referring to in an exemplary embodiment a perspective view illustrates another configuration of the UCSCL . Specifically as the UCSCL is modular and user configurable the configuration may be created where the cone and one or more of the circular rings are inverted into the front half. This configuration is an entirely different way to use a conical shape charge as it is the exact same liner components. However since it is modular you may invert the back 50 and create a circle cut with a conical shape charge instead of the typical pin hole. In particular the configuration is a way to employ it in order to achieve the effect of cutting a larger diameter circular cut instead of a single hole.
