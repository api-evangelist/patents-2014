abstract: In accordance with some embodiments, a control surface stores the index bits in a tile using multi-sampling anti-aliasing. By determining whether all the samples in a tile point to plane 0, one can use only two bits in a control surface for the tile to indicate that all the samples on the tile point to plane 0. Otherwise more than two bits may be stored in the control surface to indicate planes pointed to by the samples of the tile.

It is axiomatic that traffic to memory should be reduced as much as possible in any type of computer architecture as this saves power and or provides better performance or enables other parts in an architecture to exploit more bandwidth.

As such it is important to compress color data since this reduces the memory traffic. Multi sampling anti aliasing MSAA increases the image quality on rendered edges and it is a common method to increase rendering quality. For 4 MSAA for example each tile e.g. 8 4 pixels may be divided into 4 planes. Each sample has then 2 index bits in an index buffer which indicate which color plane that sample points to. Planes are allocated from low numbers to high numbers and plane 0 is always allocated. If all samples in a tile point to plane 0 for example then all index bits are 00.

Compression methods can compress the individual planes but compression methods do not compress the index buffers. For an 8 4 tile of pixels with four samples per pixel 4 MSAA the index bits will use 2 4 8 4 256 bits. In some examples the index bits are using 30 of the memory traffic for color.

In accordance with some embodiments a buffer stores the index bits in a tile using multi sampling anti aliasing and for the index bits a control surface is used to store hierarchical information about each tile. While the index bits in the particular example above used 256 bits per tile only two bits for example are used per tile in the control surface. By determining whether all the samples in a tile point to plane 0 one can use these two bits in a control surface and set the bits to 00 for the tile to indicate that all the samples in the tile point to plane 0. Otherwise the two bits need to store either 01 10 or 11 and these codes can be used to indicate other encodings as discussed below.

There are a substantial number of tiles that may use 1 only plane 0 or 2 only planes 0 and 1. In fact even for scenes with much higher tessellation rates the number of instances of case 1 and 2 often accounts for more than 50 of the tiles. In general these two cases should be compressible.

A control surface is a hierarchical representation of another buffer and the index bits may be stored in a buffer and a control surface may be used for the index bits in a tile. This makes it possible to indicate how the index bits in a tile are represented and to encode their representation in fewer bits than what it takes to represent all the index bits in a tile in uncompressed mode. A mode may be introduced where all samples point to plane 0 which does not require any more data. That is if all index bits in a tile point to plane 0 then instead of setting each index bits to 00 for all samples in such a tile one can simply use the two bits in the control surface to indicate that this tile has those characteristics. This can be done by for example setting the two bits or any other number depending on how many are needed to 00. Furthermore many tiles just use plane 0or 1 in which case only 1 bit per sample is needed instead of 2 bits per sample in this case. A tile s two bits in the control surface can then use the combination 01 to indicate this case. Note that in this case an architecture makes it possible to compress the index bits of a tile down to 50 . Furthermore a simple scheme can further compress more complex index buffers for a tile. In one example compression may be down to 50 but this can be generalized of course.

In this description several assumptions are made about the tile size number of samples per pixel cache line size etc. but this is just as an example. This can be generalized in all kinds of ways for different setups. Assume an 8 4 pixel tile size i.e. with 32 pixels per tile and 4 MSAA i.e. 2 bits per sample. This amounts to 2 4 32 256 bits per tile for the index bits.

A hierarchical representation of the index bits may be implemented by introducing two bits per tile in a separate control surface per MSAA render target. Their encodings are shown below for one embodiment 

Hence 00 means that no index bits need to be stored because all index bits are 00 i.e. they point to plane 0. This means that the index bits do not need to be read if the tile s control surface bits are equal to 00 since in that case all index bits in that tile are 00. This saves memory traffic a read operation . In the same way if the index bits of a tile all are 00 and if they need to be written out to memory or to the next level in a cache hierarchy then the tile s control surface bits are set to 00 saving memory traffic a write operation . Since only two bits in total are needed in the control surface to indicate this mode the compression rate is huge. Instead of 256 bits only 2 bits are stored which is 128 1 compression. This technique i.e. compressed for the case where only plane 0is used can be used in isolation if one wants to opt for a simple solution that achieves a big part of the performance game. However in this case it suffices with one bit per tile in the control surface where 0 can indicate that all index bits in the tile point to plane 0 and where 1 indicates that the index bits of the tile are uncompressed.

Encoding 01 means that all index bits are either 00 or 01. Hence two bits per index are not needed only one bit per index since the most significant bit is the same 0 in both bit combinations . This achieves 2 1 compression for all tiles that have only plane 0and plane 1 and this will always work for such tiles.

Encoding 10 means that the index bits are compressed to 50 or less using a more complex method. This may be as simple as having one bit per 2 2 pixels of index bits and if this bit is 0 then all index bits in that 2 2 pixel region are the same and the following two bits indicate what they are. If this bit is 1 the original index bits are just appended to a compressed bitstream. In many cases this will suffice and if the resulting bitstream is less or equal to 50 then compression succeeds. Otherwise one needs to send the index bits in uncompressed mode.

However other methods can be used as well. In one method a 2 2 region for example may be split so that there are two 2 bit values in that region and those two 2 bit values are first appended to the bitstream and then each sample in the 2 2 region has one bit pointing to one of these two 2 bit values.

If neither of the methods above work for the 00 01 and 10 encodings then in one embodiment the tile may be marked as 11 i.e. the index bits of the tile are stored uncompressed i.e. without compression.

There also needs to be a way to make sure that this actually saves memory bandwidth usage as well. Assume a cache with 1024 bits per cache line CL and the bus width is 512 bits. Again this is just an example and other CL sizes and bus widths work as well with straightforward extensions. The index bits for four tiles may be stored in 1024 bits 256 4 in uncompressed form. If all four tiles in a CL are in mode 00 see above then there is no need to write any data on evict from the cache and there is no need to read any data either on read requests. Instead the index bits are filled in the index bit cache with 00s. In all other cases data needs to be sent. If all tiles in a CL are in 00 01 or 10 mode then the sum will be less or equal than 512 bits or other bus width size and so all data can be written as a single transaction of 512 bits in the case of a 512 bit bus width.

When one of the tiles is in mode 00 using 0 bits except for the 2 bits in the control surface then a transaction of two times the number of pixels per tile times the number of samples per pixel e.g. 512 bits or one memory transaction bits may be used if at least two tiles are compressed with 2 1. The two configurations that are possible are shown below 

In some embodiments compressed index bits may be grouped for a plurality of tiles to reduce a first number of memory bus transactions needed if the tiles were not grouped to a second lower number of memory bus transactions. Thus you may have a group of tiles that can be transacted over a memory bus in L transactions in uncompressed form. To save bandwidth the storage of the group of tiles can be reduced down to fewer than L transactions. For example if the group of tiles is grouped into four tiles with 1024 bits and the bus width is 512 bits then two memory transactions are needed in uncompressed form. To save bandwidth the storage of the group of tiles can be reduced down so that there are fewer than L transactions. So by grouping tiles together one can determine or reduce the number of bus transactions in uncompressed form.

Sometimes samples that are cleared may be handled. For example a tile s samples may point to a cleared color or to plane 0. One more bit may be added to the control surface per tile to encode this as well. For example may indicate 2 1 compression and that each sample has a single bit where 0 indicates that the sample is cleared and 1 means that the sample points to plane 0.

In accordance with some embodiments a sequence may implement compression in connection with multi sampling anti aliasing. The sequence may be implemented in software firmware and or hardware. In software and firmware embodiments it may be implemented by computer executed instructions stored in one or more non transitory computer readable media such as magnetic optical or semiconductor storage.

Referring to the sequence begins when a tile needs to be written out to memory or to the next level in the cache hierarchy by detecting whether all samples point to plane 0as indicated at diamond . If so there is no need to store the index bits and instead the encoding to indicate that the samples point to plane 0is the only thing that needs to be stored as indicated in block .

Otherwise a check at diamond determines whether all samples point to either plane 0or plane 1. If so you only use one bit per index as indicated in block for the compression.

On the other hand a check at diamond determines whether the index bits can in fact be compressed. A couple of techniques were described above that could be used. If so the compression may be undertaken according to the appropriate technique if memory bandwidth will be saved as indicated in block .

Finally if all other options fail then the block or tile may be marked as uncompressed as indicated in block and the flow ends.

Referring to depicting a graphics pipeline pixel pipelines receive pixels from a rasterizer . The rasterizer identifies which pixels lie within a triangle currently being rendered. The rasterizer may operate on a tile of N M pixels at a time. When the rasterizer finds the tile that partially overlaps the triangle it distributes the pixels in that tile over a number of pixel pipelines . Each pixel pipeline computes the depth and color of a pixel.

The pixel pipelines supply values to a cache . On eviction the cache sends data to the compressor for compression and ultimate storage as compressed and the next level in the memory hierarchy . Information that hierarchy may then be decompressed in decompressor and supplied to the cache .

The media engine includes a video quality engine VQE for video and image post processing and a multi format encode decode MFX engine to provide hardware accelerated media data encode and decode. The geometry pipeline and media engine each generate execution threads for the thread execution resources provided by at least one graphics core A.

The graphics processor includes scalable thread execution resources featuring modular cores A N sometime referred to as core slices each having multiple sub cores A N A N sometimes referred to as core sub slices . The graphics processor can have any number of graphics cores A through N. In one embodiment the graphics processor includes a graphics core A having at least a first sub core A and a second core sub core A. In another embodiment the graphics processor is a low power processor with a single sub core e.g. A . In one embodiment the graphics processor includes multiple graphics cores A N each including a set of first sub cores A N and a set of second sub cores A N. Each sub core in the set of first sub cores A N includes at least a first set of execution units A N and media texture samplers A N. Each sub core in the set of second sub cores A N includes at least a second set of execution units A N and samplers A N. In one embodiment each sub core A N A N shares a set of shared resources A N. In one embodiment the shared resources include shared cache memory and pixel operation logic. Other shared resources may also be included in the various embodiments of the graphics processor.

In one embodiment the execution unit array A N is primarily used to execute shader programs. In one embodiment the execution units in the array A N execute an instruction set that includes native support for many standard 3D graphics shader instructions such that shader programs from graphics libraries e.g. Direct 3D and OpenGL are executed with a minimal translation. The execution units support vertex and geometry processing e.g. vertex programs geometry programs vertex shaders pixel processing e.g. pixel shaders fragment shaders and general purpose processing e.g. compute and media shaders .

Each execution unit in the execution unit array A N operates on arrays of data elements. The number of data elements is the execution size or the number of channels for the instruction. An execution channel is a logical unit of execution for data element access masking and flow control within instructions. The number of channels may be independent of the number of physical ALUs or FPUs for a particular graphics processor. The execution units A N support integer and floating point data types.

The execution unit instruction set includes single instruction multiple data SIMD instructions. The various data elements can be stored as a packed data type in a register and the execution unit will process the various elements based on the data size of the elements. For example when operating on a 256 bit wide vector the 256 bits of the vector are stored in a register and the execution unit operates on the vector as four separate 64 bit packed data elements quad word QW size data elements eight separate 32 bit packed data elements double word DW size data elements sixteen separate 16 bit packed data elements word W size data elements or thirty two separate 8 bit data elements byte B size data elements . However different vector widths and register sizes are possible.

One or more internal instruction caches e.g. are included in the thread execution logic to cache thread instructions for the execution units. In one embodiment one or more data caches e.g. are included to cache thread data during thread execution. A sampler is included to provide texture sampling for 3D operations and media sampling for media operations. In one embodiment the sampler includes specialized texture or media sampling functionality to process texture or media data during the sampling process before providing the sampled data to an execution unit.

During execution the graphics and media pipelines send thread initiation requests to the thread execution logic via thread spawning and dispatch logic. The thread execution logic includes a local thread dispatcher that arbitrates thread initiation requests from the graphics and media pipelines and instantiates the requested threads on one or more execution units A N. For example the geometry pipeline e.g. of dispatches vertex processing tessellation or geometry processing threads to the thread execution logic . The thread dispatcher can also process runtime thread spawning requests from the executing shader programs.

Once a group of geometric objects have been processed and rasterized into pixel data the pixel shader is invoked to further compute output information and cause results to be written to output surfaces e.g. color buffers depth buffers stencil buffers etc. . In one embodiment the pixel shader calculates the values of the various vertex attributes that are to be interpolated across the rasterized object. The pixel shader then executes an API supplied pixel shader program. To execute the pixel shader program the pixel shader dispatches threads to an execution unit e.g. A via the thread dispatcher . The pixel shader uses texture sampling logic in the sampler to access texture data in texture maps stored in memory. Arithmetic operations on the texture data and the input geometry data compute pixel color data for each geometric fragment or discards one or more pixels from further processing.

In one embodiment the data port provides a memory access mechanism for the thread execution logic output processed data to memory for processing on a graphics processor output pipeline. In one embodiment the data port includes or couples to one or more cache memories e.g. data cache to cache data for memory access via the data port.

In one embodiment the graphics processor execution units natively support instructions in a 128 bit format . A 64 bit compacted instruction format is available for some instructions based on the selected instruction instruction options and number of operands. The native 128 bit format provides access to all instruction options while some options and operations are restricted in the 64 bit format . The native instructions available in the 64 bit format varies by embodiment. In one embodiment the instruction is compacted in part using a set of index values in an index field . The execution unit hardware references a set of compaction tables based on the index values and uses the compaction table outputs to reconstruct a native instruction in the 128 bit format .

For each format an instruction opcode defines the operation that the execution unit is to perform. The execution units execute each instruction in parallel across the multiple data elements of each operand. For example in response to an add instruction the execution unit performs a simultaneous add operation across each color channel representing a texture element or picture element. By default the execution unit performs each instruction across all data channels of the operands. An instruction control field enables control over certain execution options such as channels selection e.g. predication and data channel order e.g. swizzle . For 128 bit instructions an exec size field limits the number of data channels that will be executed in parallel. The exec size field is not available for use in the 64 bit compact instruction format .

Some execution unit instructions have up to three operands including two source operands src src and one destination . In one embodiment the execution units support dual destination instructions where one of the destinations is implied. Data manipulation instructions can have a third source operand e.g. SRC where the instruction opcode JJ12 determines the number of source operands. An instruction s last source operand can be an immediate e.g. hard coded value passed with the instruction.

In one embodiment instructions are grouped based on opcode bit fields to simplify Opcode decode . For an 8 bit opcode bits and allow the execution unit to determine the type of opcode. The precise opcode grouping shown is exemplary. In one embodiment a move and logic opcode group includes data movement and logic instructions e.g. mov cmp . The move and logic group shares the five most significant bits MSB where move instructions are in the form of 0000xxxxb e.g. OxOx and logic instructions are in the form of 0001xxxxb e.g. 0x01 . A flow control instruction group e.g. call jmp includes instructions in the form of 0010xxxxb e.g. 0x20 . A miscellaneous instruction group includes a mix of instructions including synchronization instructions e.g. wait send in the form of 0011xxxxb e.g. 0x30 . A parallel math instruction group includes component wise arithmetic instructions e.g. add mul in the form of 0100xxxxb e.g. 0x40 . The parallel math group performs the arithmetic operations in parallel across data channels. The vector math group includes arithmetic instructions e.g. dp4 in the form of 0101xxxxb e.g. 0x50 . The vector math group performs arithmetic such as dot product calculations on vector operands.

The command streamer directs the operation of a vertex fetcher component that reads vertex data from memory and executes vertex processing commands provided by the command streamer . The vertex fetcher provides vertex data to a vertex shader which performs coordinate space transformation and lighting operations to each vertex. The vertex fetcher and vertex shader execute vertex processing instructions by dispatching execution threads to the execution units A B via a thread dispatcher .

In one embodiment the execution units A B are an array of vector processors having an instruction set for performing graphics and media operations. The execution units A B have an attached L1 cache that is specific for each array or shared between the arrays. The cache can be configured as a data cache an instruction cache or a single cache that is partitioned to contain data and instructions in different partitions.

In one embodiment the graphics pipeline includes tessellation components to perform hardware accelerated tessellation of 3D objects. A programmable hull shader configures the tessellation operations. A programmable domain shader provides back end evaluation of tessellation output. A tessellator operates at the direction of the hull shader and contains special purpose logic to generate a set of detailed geometric objects based on a coarse geometric model that is provided as input to the graphics pipeline . If tessellation is not used the tessellation components can be bypassed.

The complete geometric objects can be processed by a geometry shader via one or more threads dispatched to the execution units A B or can proceed directly to the clipper . The geometry shader operates on entire geometric objects rather than vertices or patches of vertices as in previous stages of the graphics pipeline. If the tessellation is disabled the geometry shader receives input from the vertex shader . The geometry shader is programmable by a geometry shader program to perform geometry tessellation if the tessellation units are disabled.

Prior to rasterization vertex data is processed by a clipper which is either a fixed function clipper or a programmable clipper having clipping and geometry shader functions. In one embodiment a rasterizer in the render output pipeline dispatches pixel shaders to convert the geometric objects into their per pixel representations. In one embodiment pixel shader logic is included in the thread execution logic .

The graphics engine has an interconnect bus interconnect fabric or some other interconnect mechanism that allows data and message passing amongst the major components of the graphics engine. In one embodiment the execution units A B and associated cache s texture and media sampler and texture sampler cache interconnect via a data port to perform memory access and communicate with render output pipeline components of the graphics engine. In one embodiment the sampler caches and execution units A B each have separate memory access paths.

In one embodiment the render output pipeline contains a rasterizer and depth test component that converts vertex based objects into their associated pixel based representation. In one embodiment the rasterizer logic includes a windower masker unit to perform fixed function triangle and line rasterization. An associated render and depth buffer caches are also available in one embodiment. A pixel operations component performs pixel based operations on the data though in some instances pixel operations associated with 2D operations e.g. bit block image transfers with blending are performed by the 2D engine or substituted at display time by the display controller using overlay display planes. In one embodiment a shared L3 cache is available to all graphics components allowing the sharing of data without the use of main system memory.

The graphics processor media pipeline includes a media engine and a video front end . In one embodiment the video front end receives pipeline commands from the command streamer . However in one embodiment the media pipeline includes a separate command streamer. The video front end processes media commands before sending the command to the media engine . In one embodiment the media engine includes thread spawning functionality to spawn threads for dispatch to the thread execution logic via the thread dispatcher .

In one embodiment the graphics engine includes a display engine . In one embodiment the display engine is external to the graphics processor and couples with the graphics processor via the ring interconnect or some other interconnect bus or fabric. The display engine includes a 2D engine and a display controller . The display engine contains special purpose logic capable of operating independently of the 3D pipeline. The display controller couples with a display device not shown which may be a system integrated display device as in a laptop computer or an external display device attached via an display device connector.

The graphics pipeline and media pipeline are configurable to perform operations based on multiple graphics and media programming interfaces and are not specific to any one application programming interface API . In one embodiment driver software for the graphics processor translates API calls that are specific to a particular graphics or media library into commands that can be processed by the graphics processor. In various embodiments support is provided for the Open Graphics Library OpenGL and Open Computing Language OpenCL supported by the Khronos Group the Direct3D library from the Microsoft Corporation or in one embodiment both OpenGL and D3D. Support may also be provided for the Open Source Computer Vision Library OpenCV . A future API with a compatible 3D pipeline would also be supported if a mapping can be made from the pipeline of the future API to the pipeline of the graphics processor.

The client specifies the client unit of the graphics device that processes the command data. In one embodiment a graphics processor command parser examines the client field of each command to condition the further processing of the command and route the command data to the appropriate client unit. In one embodiment the graphics processor client units include a memory interface unit a render unit a 2D unit a 3D unit and a media unit. Each client unit has a corresponding processing pipeline that processes the commands. Once the command is received by the client unit the client unit reads the opcode and if present sub opcode to determine the operation to perform. The client unit performs the command using information in the data field of the command. For some commands an explicit command size is expected to specify the size of the command. In one embodiment the command parser automatically determines the size of at least some of the commands based on the command opcode. In one embodiment commands are aligned via multiples of a double word.

The flow chart in shows a sample command sequence . In one embodiment software or firmware of a data processing system that features an embodiment of the graphics processor uses a version of the command sequence shown to set up execute and terminate a set of graphics operations. A sample command sequence is shown and described for exemplary purposes however embodiments are not limited to these commands or to this command sequence. Moreover the commands may be issued as batch of commands in a command sequence such that the graphics processor will process the sequence of commands in an at least partially concurrent manner.

The sample command sequence may begin with a pipeline flush command to cause any active graphics pipeline to complete the currently pending commands for the pipeline. In one embodiment the 3D pipeline and the media pipeline do not operate concurrently. The pipeline flush is performed to cause the active graphics pipeline to complete any pending commands. In response to a pipeline flush the command parser for the graphics processor will pause command processing until the active drawing engines complete pending operations and the relevant read caches are invalidated. Optionally any data in the render cache that is marked dirty can be flushed to memory. A pipeline flush command can be used for pipeline synchronization or before placing the graphics processor into a low power state.

A pipeline select command is used when a command sequence requires the graphics processor to explicitly switch between pipelines. A pipeline select command is required only once within an execution context before issuing pipeline commands unless the context is to issue commands for both pipelines. In one embodiment a pipeline flush command is is required immediately before a pipeline switch via the pipeline select command .

A pipeline control command configures a graphics pipeline for operation and is used to program the 3D pipeline and the media pipeline . The pipeline control command configures the pipeline state for the active pipeline. In one embodiment the pipeline control command is used for pipeline synchronization and to clear data from one or more cache memories within the active pipeline before processing a batch of commands.

Return buffer state commands are used to configure a set of return buffers for the respective pipelines to write data. Some pipeline operations require the allocation selection or configuration of one or more return buffers into which the operations write intermediate data during processing. The graphics processor also uses one or more return buffers to store output data and to perform cross thread communication. The return buffer state includes selecting the size and number of return buffers to use for a set of pipeline operations.

The remaining commands in the command sequence differ based on the active pipeline for operations. Based on a pipeline determination the command sequence is tailored to the 3D pipeline beginning with the 3D pipeline state or the media pipeline beginning at the media pipeline state .

The commands for the 3D pipeline state include 3D state setting commands for vertex buffer state vertex element state constant color state depth buffer state and other state variables that are to be configured before 3D primitive commands are processed. The values of these commands are determined at least in part based the particular 3D API in use. 3D pipeline state commands are also able to selectively disable or bypass certain pipeline elements if those elements will not be used.

The 3D primitive command is used to submit 3D primitives to be processed by the 3D pipeline. Commands and associated parameters that are passed to the graphics processor via the 3D primitive command are forwarded to the vertex fetch function in the graphics pipeline. The vertex fetch function uses the 3D primitive command data to generate vertex data structures. The vertex data structures are stored in one or more return buffers. The 3D primitive command is used to perform vertex operations on 3D primitives via vertex shaders. To process vertex shaders the 3D pipeline dispatches shader execution threads to graphics processor execution units.

The 3D pipeline is triggered via an execute command or event. In one embodiment a register write triggers command execution. In one embodiment execution is triggered via a go or kick command in the command sequence. In one embodiment command execution is triggered using a pipeline synchronization command to flush the command sequence through the graphics pipeline. The 3D pipeline will perform geometry processing for the 3D primitives. Once operations are complete the resulting geometric objects are rasterized and the pixel engine colors the resulting pixels. Additional commands to control pixel shading and pixel back end operations may also be included for those operations.

The sample command sequence follows the media pipeline path when performing media operations. In general the specific use and manner of programming for the media pipeline depends on the media or compute operations to be performed. Specific media decode operations may be offloaded to the media pipeline during media decode. The media pipeline can also be bypassed and media decode can be performed in whole or in part using resources provided by one or more general purpose processing cores. In one embodiment the media pipeline also includes elements for general purpose graphics processor unit GPGPU operations where the graphics processor is used to perform SIMD vector operations using computational shader programs that are not explicitly related to the rendering of graphics primitives.

The media pipeline is configured in a similar manner as the 3D pipeline . A set of media pipeline state commands are dispatched or placed into in a command queue before the media object commands . The media pipeline state commands include data to configure the media pipeline elements that will be used to process the media objects. This includes data to configure the video decode and video encode logic within the media pipeline such as encode or decode format. The media pipeline state commands also support the use one or more pointers to indirect state elements that contain a batch of state settings.

Media object commands supply pointers to media objects for processing by the media pipeline. The media objects include memory buffers containing video data to be processed. In one embodiment all media pipeline state must be valid before issuing a media object command . Once the pipeline state is configured and media object commands are queued the media pipeline is triggered via an execute command or an equivalent execute event e.g. register write . Output from the media pipeline may then be post processed by operations provided by the 3D pipeline or the media pipeline . In one embodiment GPGPU operations are configured and executed in a similar manner as media operations.

In one embodiment the 3D graphics application contains one or more shader programs including shader instructions . The shader language instructions may be in a high level shader language such as the High Level Shader Language HLSL or the OpenGL Shader Language GLSL . The application also includes executable instructions in a machine language suitable for execution by the general purpose processor core . The application also includes graphics objects defined by vertex data.

The operating system may be a Microsoft Windows operating system from the Microsoft Corporation a proprietary UNIX like operating system or an open source UNIX like operating system using a variant of the Linux kernel. When the Direct3D API is in use the operating system uses a front end shader compiler to compile any shader instructions in HLSL into a lower level shader language. The compilation may be a just in time compilation or the application can perform share pre compilation. In one embodiment high level shaders are compiled into low level shaders during the compilation of the 3D graphics application .

The user mode graphics driver may contain a back end shader compiler to convert the shader instructions into a hardware specific representation. When the OpenGL API is in use shader instructions in the GLSL high level language are passed to a user mode graphics driver for compilation. The user mode graphics driver uses operating system kernel mode functions to communicate with a kernel mode graphics driver . The kernel mode graphics driver communicates with the graphics processor to dispatch commands and instructions.
