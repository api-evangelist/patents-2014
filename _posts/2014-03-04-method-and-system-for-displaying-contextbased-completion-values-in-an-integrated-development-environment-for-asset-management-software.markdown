The present disclosure relates to the displaying of completion values in an integrated development environment specifically the retrieval of completion values from a database of an external asset management server based on completion attributes in the integrated development environment.

Enterprise asset management software is used by entities to operate maintain and manage enterprise assets. Many such software products such as Maximo by IBM provide for the management of assets across multiple departments locations facilities and business units for businesses and other entities. However as asset management software is often designed to be useful for a broad range of entities and industries such software may lack specific features that may be beneficial or necessary for certain entities. As a result application programming interfaces may be available to interact with the software or its associated data which may be used by an entity to develop additional functionality of the software.

However due to the complicated nature of asset management software and the storage and maintenance of related assets developing such functionality may be exceedingly difficult. In particular the writing of scripts and programming code to interact with the asset management software may present a high level of difficulty to users. Thus there is a perceived need for a solution to access context based values and relationships in the database on the asset management software server for presentation to a user of a local system for inclusion in an integrated development environment.

The present disclosure provides a description of systems and methods for the display of completion values in an integrated development environment.

In step the input device of the computing device may receive an input command from the user via the input interface . The input command may be a specific command or one of a plurality of specific commands configured to trigger the continuation of the process . For instance in one example the input command may be the inserting of a . character in the editor by the user .

In step the processing device of the computing device may identify the text included in the editor to detect if there is any text preceding the cursor position at the time the input command is received from the user . In some instances the detection may be based on the received input command. For instance the processing device may presume that there is text preceding the cursor position if the input command is a . character but may presume that there is no text preceding the cursor position if the input command is a specific combination of keys on a keyboard. In other instances the processing device may identify the cursor position and the position of text inside the editor to determine if there is text preceding the cursor position.

If the processing device determines that there is no text preceding the cursor position then in step the processing device may identify at least one completion attribute based on the editor currently being executed by the processing device and displayed to the user . In one embodiment the completion attribute may be the name or a descriptive element of the editor. If the processing device determines that there is text preceding the cursor position then in step the processing device may identify at least one completion attribute based on the text preceding the cursor position. In one embodiment the completion attribute may be a text word or value preceding the cursor position. In some embodiments the identified at least one completion attribute may be based on partial execution and or analysis of the text included in the editor. For instance if the text included in the editor includes a program script the script may be at least partially executed to identify one or more completion attributes.

One the completion attribute or attributes has been identified then in step the processing device may determine if associated completion values are cached in the memory . If completion values corresponding to the identified at least one completion attribute are not cached then in step the transmitting device of the computing server may transmit a request for completion values to the asset management server via the network . The asset management server may then identify completion values stored in the asset database based on the at least one completion attribute. The completion values may include fields values relationships methods attributes or other suitable data as will be apparent to persons having skill in the relevant art.

In step the receiving device of the computing server may receive the plurality of completion values from the asset management server over the network .

As discussed above the user may input an input command into the input device via the input interface . The input command may be transmitted to the processing device which may identify the input command as triggering the process discussed above. The processing device may then as discussed above detect if there is text preceding the cursor position . As illustrated in the processing device may not detect any text preceding the cursor position and thus may identify at least one completion attribute based on the editor corresponding to the editor window . The processing device may then identify e.g. in a cache of the memory or receive e.g. from the asset management server a plurality of completion values corresponding to the at least one completion attribute.

The display device may then transmit the plurality of completion values to the display for display to the user . As illustrated in the text area may include an overlay configured to display the plurality of completion values . In some embodiments the overlay may be located at or near the cursor position and may be placed ahead e.g. in front of text included in the text area . The user may then make a selection of a value in the overlay via the input device . The processing device may then insert the selected value in the text area at the cursor position .

In an exemplary embodiment the plurality of completion values are based on data in and or included in the asset database of the asset management server . In such an embodiment the plurality of completion values may change as data stored in the asset database changes. For example the plurality of completion values may include database fields that may be changed during the course of business or may refer to business assets that may be added or deleted from the asset database . In such an instance the user may be presented with the most recent and most accurate data stored in the asset database which may provide for a more effective development environment.

In one embodiment the detected existence or absence of text preceding the cursor position may be based on the received input command.

In step at least one completion attribute may be identified by the processing device of the computing system wherein the at least one completion attribute is based on i content of text preceding the cursor position if existence of the text is detected or ii the displayed editor if absence of text is detected. In one embodiment the displayed editor may include a script and the content of text preceding the cursor position may be based on partial execution of the script included in the displayed editor.

In step the identified at least one completion attribute may be transmitted by a transmitting device e.g. the transmitting device of the computing system to a computing server e.g. the asset management server configured to execute asset management software.

In step a plurality of completion values may be received by a receiving device e.g. the receiving device of the computing system from the computing server based on the identified at least one completion attribute. In one embodiment the plurality of completion values may include at least one of fields and relationships of a database e.g. the asset database stored in the computing server and associated with the asset management software executed by the computing server . In some embodiments the plurality of completion values may include at least one of fields relationships attributes and methods.

In step the received plurality of completion values may be stored in a memory e.g. the memory of the computing system . In one embodiment the received plurality of completion values stored in the memory of the computing system may be deleted from the memory after a predetermined period of time. In step the plurality of completion values may be displayed for selection by the user via the input device of the computing system at the cursor position in the displayed editor. In some embodiments the plurality of completion values may be displayed in the displayed editor via an application programming interface API of the IDE.

In one embodiment the method may further include receiving by the input device of the computing system a user selection of a specific completion value of the plurality of completion values and displaying by the display device the specific completion value as inserted text at the cursor position. In some embodiments attributes and methods associated with at least one of the displayed editor and text included in the displayed editor may be stored in the memory of the computing system . In a further embodiment the method may further include updating by the processing device of the computing system the plurality of completion values to include the stored attributes and methods prior to displaying in the displayed editor.
