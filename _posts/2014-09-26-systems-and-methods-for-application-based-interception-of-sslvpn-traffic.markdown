This application is a continuation of and claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Non provisional application Ser. No. 11 462 329 entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR APPLICATION BASED INTERCEPTION OF SSL VPN TRAFFIC filed on Aug. 3 2006 and which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

The present invention generally relates to secure data communication networks and in particular to systems and methods for increasing the security of data communication networks by authorizing SSL VPN data communications on a more granular basis.

Virtual private networks provide users of a client computer with secure access to remote resources when public networks. Many virtual private networks use network appliances to provide secure connections to clients. For example a user may access resources including applications web sites and files by connecting to a network appliance which manages a number of virtual private network connections. In many cases an agent program associated with the client identifies network communications intended for the virtual private network based on the address used to send the communication.

However this technique suffers from a number of drawbacks. Because all traffic corresponding to an address range is sent to the virtual private network whether appropriately sent to the network or not robust authorization policies must be created to filter appropriate virtual private network traffic from traffic that should not be sent on the virtual private network. Such policies are difficult to create and difficult to maintain. Also blanket routing of all data communication to a virtual private network whether appropriate or not can increase security risks since a malicious user may use data traffic having the correct address range to cause harm to the data center the virtual private network is meant to protect.

It would therefore be desirable to provide systems and methods to route data in a virtual private network environment on a more granular basis than subnet identification.

In one aspect the present invention relates to a method for intercepting communication of a client to a destination on a virtual private network. The decision to intercept is based on a network destination description of an application authorized to be accessed via the virtual private network. An agent executing on the client intercepts a network communication of the client. The agent provides a virtual private network connection from a first network to a second network. The agent determines that a destination specified by the intercepted communication corresponds to a network identifier and a port of a network destination description of an application on the second network authorized for access via the virtual private network. In response to this determination the agent transmits the intercepted communication.

In some embodiments the agent determines that the network communication does not correspond to the network destination description of the application and transmits the intercepted network communication via the first network. In other embodiments the agent determines that the network communication does not correspond to the network destination description of the application and drops the intercepted network communication. In still other embodiments the agent determines that the network identifier and the port of the client correspond to a source internet protocol address and a source port of the network destination description of the application. In still other embodiments the agent determines a type of protocol for which the network communication is formatted corresponds to a protocol specified by the network destination description of the application. In yet other embodiments the agent determines not to intercept a second network communication of the client destined to a second application not authorized for access to the second network via the virtual private network connection. In some of these embodiments the agent intercepts network communication transparently to one of the application or a user of the client.

In another aspect the present invention relates to a method for providing a level of access by an appliance to a resource by an application on a client via a virtual private network connection. A decision to allow or deny a level of access is based on identification of the application. The appliance intercepts a request from an application on a client on a first network to access via a virtual private network connection a resource on a second network. The appliance identifies the application and associates with the intercepted request an authorization policy based on the identity of the application. In one embodiment the appliance determines using the authorization policy and the identity of the application to either allow or deny access by the application to the resource.

In some embodiments the agent transmits a name of the application to the appliance. In further of these embodiments name of the application is used as the identifier of the application. In other embodiments the agent establishes the virtual private network connection to the second network via the appliance. In still other embodiments an authorization policy specifies a name of the application and an authorization to either access or deny a level of access. In some of these embodiments the appliance associates the authorization policy of the application with a user of the client. In others of these embodiments the appliance identifies the authorization policy of the application based on a user of the client.

In yet another aspect the present invention relates to a method for intercepting by an agent of a client communications from the client to be transmitted via a virtual private network connection. The interception is based on identification of an application from which the communication originates. The agent receives information identifying a first application. The agent determines a network communication transmitted by the client originates from the first application and intercepts that communication. The agent transmits the intercepted communication via the virtual private network connection.

In view of the structure functions and operations of the client agent and appliance described above the client agent provides a finer grain of control over the network communications of the client to be transmitted via the appliance such as via an SSL VPN connection. The client agent may intercept communications by application name or any portion and combination of the network or IP layer information such as destination and source IP addresses and destination and source ports. In this manner the client agent can be configured to intercept specific network traffic patterns such as traffic to a specific application from a specific application and or between a specific source end point to a specific destination end point. By intercepting and filtering network traffic at or closer to the client avoids unnecessary network traffic being processed by the appliance and the appliance having to apply policies to protect the network. This provides additional security to the network protected by the appliance as the client agent does not transmit undesired network traffic to the appliance. Furthermore the appliance provides finer grain control of authentication authorization and auditing policies on a per application basis and even on a per request basis for each application.
