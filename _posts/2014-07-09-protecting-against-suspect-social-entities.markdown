title: Protecting against suspect social entities
abstract: A method includes identifying data on a social network that is associated with a suspect social entity, and determining one or more characteristics of the identified data. A reference to the identified data is generated for each of the one or more characteristics. One or more of the generated references are compared to one or more stored references, where the one or more stored references are associated with a protected social entity. A profile score for the suspect social entity is determined based on the comparison. Determining the profile score includes identifying a match between one or more of the generated references and one or more of the stored references.

This application is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 218 522 filed Mar. 18 2014 and titled Social Network Scanning which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 798 917 filed Mar. 15 2013 and titled Social Threat Assessment U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 799 115 filed Mar. 15 2013 and titled Social Threat Scores and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 799 610 filed Mar. 15 2013 and titled Social Threat Alerts. This application is also a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 842 716 filed Mar. 15 2013 and titled Social Threat Management. All of these prior applications are incorporated by reference in their entirety.

Traditional approaches to combatting cyber threats focus on securing endpoints and networks through reactive security measures that are focused on securing computing devices. Anti virus programs for example can be used to detect malicious software associated with local system level attacks e.g. a virus attached to an email and when defenses have already been breached to quarantine dangerous files that are detected within a computer system. Firewalls and other edge security devices can be used to establish a perimeter around sensitive systems by controlling the passage of information between networks so as to reduce the risk of unauthorized access

Modern cyber threats however evolve alongside computer technology and attackers can be expected to leverage whatever means are available in order compromise or bypass traditional defenses. The development and expansion of social media for instance has introduced significant information security risk to both individuals and organizations. These risks include targeted social based cyber attacks fraud impersonations and social engineering. The evolving risk necessitates security technology that is predictive rather than reactive in nature and that identifies dormant maliciously minded entities before they can initiate an attack.

In one aspect data on a social network that is associated with a suspect social entity is identified and one or more characteristics of the identified data are determined. A reference to the identified data is generated for each of the one or more characteristics and the one or more generated references are compared to one or more stored references where the one or more stored references are associated with a protected social entity. A profile score for the suspect social entity is determined based on the comparison where determining the profile score includes identifying a match between one or more of the generated references and one or more of the stored references.

In another aspect the suspect social entity is an imposter of the protected social entity. The profile score for the suspect social entity is compared to a threshold and a security action is initiated if the profile score exceeds the threshold. Initiating the security action includes generating an alert and providing the alert to the protected social entity. The alert identifies the suspect social entity. In yet another aspect providing the alert to the protected social entity includes providing computer based alerts to the protected social entity. Providing computer based alerts to the protected entity may include emailing the protected social entity. Providing computer based alerts to protected social entity may include providing a web based alert to the protected social entity.

In yet another aspect the alert indicates fraud impersonation or social engineering. The one or more characteristics of the data are selected from the group consisting of name date of birth gender location email address education and organization.

In a further aspect the one or more characteristics include an image and generating a reference to the image includes deriving data from the image. Deriving data from the image may include hashing the image for comparison or determining one or more facial characteristics of an individual included in the image.

Other implementations of these aspects include corresponding systems apparatus and computer programs configured to perform the described techniques encoded on computer storage devices.

The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other potential features aspects and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description the drawings and the claims.

Predictive and active social risk management technology reduces the risks posed to individuals and enterprises by cyber threats that target and exploit the social vector. Traditional approaches to combating cyber threats focus on endpoint and perimeter security providing reactive protection through for example anti virus software email and web gateways firewalls and intrusion detection systems. Cyber threats have evolved however and attacks now leverage social network and social media communications as means of bypassing traditional protections. The evolving risk necessitates security technology that is predictive and active rather than reactive in nature and that identifies dormant malicious entities before they can launch an attack.

In more detail an active social risk defense engine that identifies live attacks can be paired with a predictive analysis framework that identifies dormant risks before attacks occur. The predictive analysis framework can be driven by a scoring algorithm that can determine and score a risk posed by a social entity by analyzing characteristics of a target URL file or social communication that is associated with the social entity. The framework can analyze the target via a variety of analytical factors and can dynamically determine which factors to employ where each factor employed by the algorithm is associated with one or more characteristics of the target and or social entity. Based on the result of analysis the algorithm can score the risk posed by the social entity and can recommend or take appropriate security action based on a comparison of the social risk score to a social risk threshold.

Active risk protection module of user analysis engine may be used to protect user from immediate security risks by for example thwarting live attacks. In more detail either of unknown social entity or known social entity may attempt to communicate with or connect to user . In response to an attempt by a social entity at communication or connection with user active risk protection module may identify a URL file or social communication associated with the social entity and may initiate a security action after performing an analysis related to the identified URL file or social communication.

In more detail Uniform Resource Locators function as addresses that are used for example to specify the location of documents on the World Wide Web. An individual URL which may be referred to as a web address is a specific character string that references i.e. provides the location of a resource. For example http zerofox.com references the homepage of ZeroFox a cyber security technology company. Risk protection module may identify an association between a social entity and a URL when for example the source of the URL is a social communication originating with the social entity or when the URL references a social network profile of the social entity. A social communication may be for example a post on a social network or a message sent between users of a social network.

Risk protection module may determine based on the URL associated with the social entity attempting to connect to or communicate with user that the social entity is a known entity such as known social entity . The determination may involve for example identifying an entry in social risk database that is associated with the social entity the entry including the URL and a social risk score for the social entity. Alternatively risk protection module may determine based on for example an absence of an entry associated with the social entry in social risk database that the social entity is an unknown entity such as unknown social entity . The determination may involve for example identifying an identity as a known entity only for a specific period of time. Prior to the expiration of the specified period of time a social entity that was scanned and identified as a known entity will be considered to be a known entity while after the expiration it will again be considered to be an unknown entity.

In response to determining that the social entity attempting to connect to or communicate with user is a known entity risk protection module may identify the social risk score that is associated with the social entity and may recommend or take appropriate security action based on a comparison of the social risk score to a social risk threshold.

A social risk score is a calculation of the security risk associated with a target URL file or social communication and thus the risk posed by a scored social entity that is associated with the target. Social risk scores may be determined by the predictive risk protection module of security analysis engine which may proactively identify cyber threats before attacks occur. The predictive risk protection module may be driven by a scoring algorithm that can determine and score a risk posed by a dormant social entity by analyzing a target URL file or social communication that is associated with the social entity prior to a user s engagement with the social entity. The social risk scores determined by the predictive protection module may be associated with corresponding URLs in entries that are generated by security analysis engine and that are stored in social risk database .

A variety of analytical factors can be used by the scoring algorithm to analyze a target URL file or social communication where each factor employed by the algorithm is associated with one or more characteristics of the target and or the social entity associated with the target. The characteristics of the target and or social entity that may be analyzed by the scoring algorithm include contextual lexical visual audio profile URL file network destination content domain host and application characteristics. The algorithm may analyze for example content of a resource that is referenced by a target URL such as a social network profile of the social entity that is referenced by the target. The algorithm may analyze the content or function of a target file and or the type size or attributes of the target file.

The algorithm may dynamically determine which factors to employ in analyzing a target URL file or social communication. The algorithm may for example assign a confidence level to a social risk score that is determined based on a first set of factors and if the confidence level falls below a confidence threshold the algorithm may refine the social risk score based on one or more additional sets of factors until the confidence level assigned to the social risk score meets or exceeds the confidence threshold.

A social risk threshold represents a level of tolerance for risk and a particular social risk threshold may be associated with a particular user organization or entity. Security analysis engine may assign a social risk threshold to a user organization or entity based on for example input from the user or one or more characteristics of the user user s social network activity and or a collection of users associated with the organization or entity.

When the risk protection module determines that the social entity attempting to connect to to follow or communicate with user is a known entity the risk protection module may identify the social risk score that is associated with the social entity based on entry in social risk database and may recommend or take appropriate security action based on a comparison of the social risk score to the user s social risk threshold. The risk protection module may for example alert the user to the potential risk posed by the social entity and or block the social entity s communication or connection attempt.

When on the other hand the risk protection module determines that the social entity attempting to connect to or communicate with user is an unknown entity the risk protection module may use the scoring algorithm to generate a social risk score for the unknown entity and may store the generated social risk score in a new entry in the social risk database the new entry including the URL associated with the unknown entity and or characteristics of the social entity or user. The risk protection module may then recommend or take appropriate security action based on a comparison of the social risk score to the user s social risk threshold.

The predictive risk protection module may in addition to proactively determining social risk scores alert the user to risks posed by other social entities based on entries in social risk database . The predictive risk protection module may for example alert the user to risks posed by social entities with which user has had no contact. For example the risk protection module may identify a connection between user and known social entity in addition to a connection between known social entity and another social entity in social network . An entry in social risk database may indicate that the social risk score for known social entity falls below user s social risk threshold but another entry may indicate that the social risk score associated with the social entity with which user has had no contact exceeds user s social risk threshold. In cases like this the predictive risk protection module may based on a comparison between a social entity s social risk score and a user s social risk threshold initiate a security action relating to the social entity even before the social entity attempts to connect to or communicate with the user.

Process begins when security analysis engine identifies a social entity based on a URL that is associated with the social entity . The social entity may be identified for example by active risk protection module of the user analysis engine in response to an attempt by the social entity to connect to or to communicate with user . Alternatively the social entity may be identified by predictive risk protection module as it proactively seeks out dormant risks.

After identifying the social entity security analysis engine may determine whether the social entity is a known entity or is instead an unknown entity . In some implementations the security analysis engine or the user analysis engine may determine whether the social entity is a known entity or an unknown entity. If the social entity is a known entity the security analysis engine may compare the social risk score that is associated with the social entity in social risk database to a social risk threshold that is associated with the user and may determine whether the social risk score exceeds the social risk threshold . If the social risk score that is associated with the social entity exceeds the social risk threshold that is associated with the user the security analysis engine may initiate an appropriate security action . If however the social risk score that is associated with the social entity does not exceed the social risk threshold that is associated with the user the security analysis engine may instead take no action.

If the social entity is an unknown entity the security analysis engine may analyze characteristics of the social entity and or of a target URL file or social communication that is associated with the social entity in order to determine a social risk score . The security analysis engine may generate an entry in the social risk database that contains both the social risk score and one or more characteristics of the social entity and or the target. The security analysis engine may then compare the social risk score that is associated with the social entity to a social risk threshold that is associated with the user and may determine whether the social risk score exceeds the social risk threshold . If the social risk score that is associated with the social entity exceeds the social risk threshold that is associated with the user the security analysis engine may initiate an appropriate security action . If however the social risk score that is associated with the social entity does not exceed the social risk threshold that is associated with the user the security analysis engine may instead take no action.

The security analysis engine may be configured to actively scan one or more social networks for data that is available and that pertains to a social entity and may be further configured to receive additional data that is available from other sources. In some implementations the active scanning of the one or more social networks for data may be implemented by the user analysis engine .

A social entity may be in some instances a user of a social network such as an individual or a corporation. John Doe for example may maintain a Facebook profile in which case John Doe would be identified by security analysis engine as a social entity and information that is available through John Doe s profile including pictures textual content posts and links would be associated with John Doe. Similarly if Acme Inc. maker of fine widgets maintains a Twitter account for purposes of public relations Acme Inc. would be identified by security analysis engine as a social entity and information tweeted by representatives of Acme Inc. could be associated with both Acme Inc. and its representatives. In some instances however a social entity may be an individual who has generated a fake profile page spoofing another social entity. For example a malicious individual or bot could establish a second fake Acme Inc. Twitter profile but having been identified as a fake the profile would be associated with the social entity that is the malicious individual or bot rather than with Acme Inc. In other instances the social entity may be a software application that runs automated tasks in relation to a social network. A social network may harbor for example a malicious bot that is configured to maintain a social network profile for purposes of phishing user data or spreading computer viruses. The malicious bot would also be identified by security analysis engine as a social entity and information on or related to the malicious bot s profile would be associated with the malicious bot.

Data that is identified by security analysis engine through the process of scanning a social network may include for example information that is available through a social entity s profile information that is available to security analysis engine by virtue of an agreement with the social entity and information that is provided to security analysis engine by the social network or by another third party. A hyperlink that is associated with a social entity for example may be identified through the social entity s profile if the profile contains a reference to the hyperlink. The hyperlink may also be identified through a social network communication such as a message post or tweet if the social network communication is a source of the hyperlink.

The security analysis engine may be further configured to determine one or more characteristics of identified data. Characteristics of an identified hyperlink may include for example URL network destination content domain and host. Characteristics of identified content that is associated with a social entity such as the text of a post by the social entity or associated files may include for example contextual lexical visual or audio indicators. Security analysis engine may generate references to identified data and to characteristics of identified data. Once generated the references may be stored in for example social risk database for later use by the security analysis engine . The stored references may be used for example to evaluate and score a risk posed by a social entity.

Process begins when a scanner identifies data on one or more social networks that is associated with a social entity . The scanner may be hosted at an entity that is different and separate from the security analysis engine . Alternatively the scanner may be part of or otherwise associated with the security analysis engine and may be integrated into the system illustrated in .

Security analysis engine may for example actively scan social networks for publicly or authorized available information. Security analysis engine may additionally identify information that is associated with a social entity and that is received through an application programming interface API . The type of data that is scanned from social networks may vary depending on the social network. For some social networks security analysis engine may only have access to publicly available information in which case the scan of the social network would be limited to identifying and or acquiring this publicly available data. Other social networks may instead recognize security analysis engine as an authorized user or as otherwise having elevated security status and may therefore provide security analysis engine with access to additional information that is not available to the general public. The different social networks may contain different types of data associated with a user profile. The security analysis engine accesses each social network for only data that is available for that network. The security analysis engine would not request data from a social network that is not maintained by the social network. For example the security analysis engine may scan a LinkedIn profile instead of a Twitter profile for employment information.

Security analysis engine may be configured to scan for only a subset of the data that is available on or through a social network. Scanning may be limited for example to popular pages or user profiles on a social network such as popular Facebook profiles and or popular Twitter hash tags. Security analysis engine may also be configured to scan social networks for any information associated with a particular individual enterprise or company. Security analysis engine may for example be configured to scan the LinkedIn profiles of all employees of Acme Inc. In some implementations the system may constantly scan one or more social networks for data. In other implementations the system may only scan during a set time period.

The security analysis engine may determine one or more characteristics of identified data . Characteristics that may be determined for identified data may vary depending on the type of data. Identified data that is associated with a social entity may include for example the social entity s user name history contacts and associated links and content. For an individual the identified data may also include demographic information such as age gender location and place of employment. Characteristics of a post may include for example language timestamp URL domain or other information and metadata.

In some instances identified data may include data that is correlated. Audio visual A V content data and textual data may for example be correlated in an instance in which the text describes the NV data. In another example content data may be a URL to a link the text data may include a user profile that is associated with the link. For example the identified data may include a link to the Acme Inc. website that was posted by John Doe an avid fan or detractor of Acme Inc. In this example the posted content or the link to the Acme Inc. website may be determined to be characteristics of the identified data in addition to characteristics that include correlations between data identified from John Doe s profile.

Following determination of the characteristics of the identified data security analysis engine may generate for each of the one or more characteristics a reference to the characteristic or to the identified data to which the characteristic pertains . Security analysis engine may for instance create a reference to a characteristic by tagging the characteristic. The characteristic may be tagged for example with a keyword or term that describes the characteristic.

Security analysis engine may store references to identified data in one or more databases for later analysis . References to identified data that is associated with a social entity may be stored for example in social risk database and may later be accessed to generate a social risk score for the social entity. Storage of references to identified data rather than the identified data itself may minimize the amount of memory needed to assess and to act on risks posed by social entities. In some implementations however both references to identified data and the identified data itself may be stored. In some implementations all references to the one or more characteristics of the identified data associated with the social entity are stored while in others only a select group of references are stored.

In more detail the user analysis engine may scan a protected social entity s profile on a social network for identifying information that may be unique to the protected social entity. The user analysis engine may for example scan the protected entity s profile page for data including a profile picture name date of birth place of employment education and location etc. The user analysis engine may then actively scan one or more social networks to identify social entities that may be impersonating the protected social entity. The user analysis engine may identify an impersonating social entity by assessing how similar data that is associated with a suspect social entity is to the data that is associated with the protected social entity.

A protected social entity may be an individual who seeks protection from a social threat protection tool such as user analysis engine . Jane Roe for example may seek to protect her personal account from suspect social entities that may attempt to use her personal information to generate one or more fraudulent accounts on social media websites. In some examples a protected social entity may be an enterprise or a company Acme Inc. for example may be a social entity that seeks to protect its corporate profiles on social websites and to monitor other social entities on social websites that claim to be employed or otherwise affiliated with Acme Inc.

A suspect social entity that is an imposter may generate and maintain fraudulent profiles that impersonate accounts of other social entities on social media websites. A fraudulent profile may be generated and maintained by an individual. For example John Doe may impersonate Jane Roe by generating a fake profile page for Jane Roe on LinkedIn using an image of Jane obtained from the Internet unbeknownst to Jane Ford herself. In other examples one or more a fraudulent profiles may be generated and maintained by a malicious bot on a social media website. A suspect social entity may be a social entity that is potentially associated with a fraudulent social network profile or account. A suspect social entity may also be a social entity that potentially falsely claims to be affiliated with an enterprise or association. John Doe for example may falsely list ZeroFox as an employer. A suspect social entity may generate an imposter profile of a protected social entity on a social network. The imposter profile may include the exact information from the real profile page of the protected social entity. For example the imposter profile may include the protected social entity s profile picture date of birth location place of employment and any other additional profile information.

In some instances an imposter profile may not initially post any malicious malware on behalf of the protected social entity or otherwise perform actions that would themselves constitute threats to computer security. In these instances the imposter may simply impersonate the protected entity through a social profile and messaging and through that impersonation may connect with followers of the genuine protected social entity. Through this behavior the imposter may misrepresent positions of the protected social entity or otherwise damage its interests and reputation. Moreover the impersonator may exploit the trust of the protected social entity s followers by later engaging in malicious behavior that targets the followers.

The user analysis engine may be configured to take security actions in response to the identification of a fraudulent profile. User analysis engine may for example flag identified fraudulent profiles that have been generated to impersonate the profile of a protected social entity. The flagged fraudulent profiles may also be monitored to identify any malicious actions. A fraudulent profile may for example be maintained on a watch list of social media profiles that should be monitored for malicious acts. The fraudulent profile may be an imposter of a protected social entity. The imposter may or may not post malicious content on behalf of the protected security. The security analysis engine may identity any imposters of the protected social entity. A protected social entity may be alerted to posts or other actions carried out by suspect social entities that have been identified as impersonators of the protected social entity. For example if malware is posted to a fraudulent LinkedIn page run by a social entity that is impersonating Jane Roe Jane may be alerted of the action. Similarly if Acme Inc. is a protected social entity Acme Inc. may receive alerts if a fraudulent profile distributes malware in the company s name.

Process begins when a scanner identifies data on one or more social networks that is associated with a suspect social entity . The scanner may be hosted at an entity that is different and separate from the security analysis engine . Alternatively the scanner may be part of or otherwise associated with the security analysis engine and may be integrated into the system illustrated in . In some implementations the process may be executed by the user analysis engine .

Security analysis engine may actively scan social networks for publicly available information and or information that is available to security analysis engine by special authorization. As described earlier the type of data that is scanned from social networks may vary depending on the social network. For some social networks security analysis engine may only have access to publicly available information in which case the scan of the social network would be limited to identifying and or acquiring this publicly available data. Other social networks may instead recognize security analysis engine as an authorized user or as otherwise having an elevated security status and may therefore provide security analysis engine with access to additional information that is not available to the general public.

The security analysis engine may determine one or more characteristics of identified data . Characteristics that may be determined for the identified data may vary depending on the type of data identified. Identified data that is associated with a suspect social entity may include for example the suspect social entity s user name profile picture date of birth gender location email address education and organization. The identified data associated with the suspect social entity may also include data about the friends followers or connections of the suspect social entity. In some implementations the security analysis engine may determine a rating for the friends or followers of a suspect entity. In these implementations the profile score of the social entity may be affected by the rating determined for the friends or followers of the social entity. For example the security analysis may rate the friends or followers of an entity as high risk based on a large number of the friends or following being associated with malicious acts.

Following a determination of the characteristics of the identified data security analysis engine may generate for each of the one or more characteristics a reference to the characteristic or to the identified data to which the characteristic pertains . Security analysis engine may for instance create a reference to a characteristic by tagging the characteristic. The characteristic may be tagged for example with a keyword or term that describes the characteristic.

References to characteristics of identified data that is associated with a protected social entity may be generated when the security analysis engine scans social websites. The security analysis engine may scan a protected social entity s profile for example for data including the protected social entity s user name profile picture date of birth gender location email address education and organization. In some examples the protected social entity may provide additional images other than the entity s current profile picture. In these examples the security analysis engine may store a reference to the additional images. When the protected social entity is a popular individual or celebrity the security analysis engine may acquire additional images from websites such as Wikipedia and store references to these images. In some other examples the protected social entity may be an enterprise or company that seeks to protect the use of an emblem or logo that is associated with the enterprise or company. The security analysis engine may in these examples store references to images that are associated with the company.

The security analysis engine may store the references to the identified data in a database. Storage of references to identified data rather than the identified data itself may minimize the amount of memory needed to assess and to act on risks posed by social entities. In some implementations however both references to identified data and the identified data itself may be stored. In some implementations all references to the one or more characteristics of the identified data associated with the protected social entity are stored while in others only a select group of references are stored.

The security analysis engine may compare one or more generated references to one or more stored references . In some implementations the process may be executed by the user analysis engine . The user analysis engine may store one or more references to characteristics of identified data associated with a protected social entity.

The user analysis engine may use one or more techniques to compare generated references to identified data that is associated with a suspect social entity to stored references to identified data that is associated with a protected social entity. The user analysis engine may compare images obtained from websites such as Wikipedia to compare to the image of the suspect social entity. The user analysis engine may derive data from an image by hashing the image. The user analysis engine may for example generate a reference to an image that is associated with a suspect social entity by deriving data from the image and may compare the derived data with data derived from an image that is associated with a protected social entity. The user analysis engine may for example hash an image that is associated with the suspect social entity and may compare the hashed image with a hash of an image that is associated with a protected social entity. Through this method or by other techniques the user analysis engine may be able to detect if an image associated with a protected social entity is being used by an imposter. The user analysis engine may also use facial recognition to identify individuals in images and to generate references. The facial recognition process that is executed on images can be used to recognize various characteristics of individuals in the images including facial structure or gender.

In some implementations the user analysis engine may determine a match score for each comparison that occurs between references to characteristics associated with the protected social entity and references to characteristics associated with the suspect social entity. The user analysis engine may then determine an overall profile score of a suspect social entity based on an average of the match scores of each comparison. The user analysis engine may for example determine a match score based on a comparison of references to a name field of a protected social entity and one or more suspect social entities. The user analysis engine may determine a high match score for suspect entities that have variations of the name of the protected social entity. For example suspect entities Mike Hall Micky Hall Mic Hall Mik Hall Mick Hall Michael H and M Hall may be assigned a high match score for the protected social entity Michael Hall.

The user analysis engine may also compare a reference to a location of a protected social entity to a reference of the location of a suspect entity. In some implementations the location of a suspect social entity may be identified from demographic information listed on the profile page of the suspect social entity.

Following comparison of references the user analysis engine may determine a profile score of the suspected social entity . The profile score is a quantifiable rating that measures how closely a suspect social entity matches a protected social entity. In some implementations the user analysis engine may calculate a match score for each reference that is compared between the protected social entity and the suspect social entity. In these implementations the profile score may be determined as the average of the match scores. In other implementations the profile score may be determined using a different algorithm. The profile score may for example be determined as a weighted average of a comparison of the references between the protected social entity and the suspect social entity. A comparison of a reference to an image for instance may be more heavily weighted than that of a reference to the location which may in turn be more heavily weighted than a reference to a date of birth.

Process begins when a scanner identifies data on one or more social networks that is associated with a suspect social entity . The scanner may be hosted at an entity that is different and separate from the user analysis engine . Alternatively the scanner may be part of or otherwise associated with the user analysis engine and may be integrated into the system illustrated in .

The user analysis engine may determine one or more characteristics of identified data . Characteristics that may be determined for identified data may vary depending on the type of data identified. Identified data that is associated with a suspect social entity may include for example the suspect social entity s user name the suspect social entity s profile picture date of birth gender location email address education and organization.

Following a determination of the characteristics of the identified data user analysis engine may generate for each of the one or more characteristics a reference to the characteristic or to the identified data to which the characteristic pertains . User analysis engine may for instance create a reference to a characteristic by tagging the characteristic. The characteristic may be tagged for example with a keyword or term that describes the characteristic.

The user analysis engine may compare one or more generated references to one or more stored references . The user analysis engine may store one or more references to characteristics of identified data associated with a protected social entity. The user analysis engine may use one or more different techniques to compare the generated references associated with the suspect social entity to the stored references associated with the protected social entity.

Following the comparison of the references the user analysis engine may determine a profile score of the suspected social entity . The profile score is a quantifiable rating that measures how closely there is a match to the protected social entity that is how likely the suspect social entity may be considered as an entity attempting to impersonate the protected social entity.

The user analysis engine may compare a profile score that is associated with the suspect entity to a profile score threshold and may determine whether the profile score exceeds the profile score threshold . If a profile score that is associated with the social entity exceeds a profile score threshold the security analysis engine may initiate a security action . If however the profile score that is associated with the suspect social entity does not exceed the threshold profile score the security analysis engine may instead take no action. In some implementations initiating a security action may include generating an alert and proving the generated alert to the protected social entity. For example Clark Kent may receive an alert describing Clarke Kent as a suspect social entity that is an imposter. In some implementations the alert may be a web based alert. The alert may also be received as an email or as a text message on a mobile device of the protected social entity. In other implementations the protected social entity may be provided with visual alerts through a social threat protection tool that identifies suspect social entities.

As illustrates the social threat protection platform may have one or more applications. The screenshot illustrated in shows the identity page of the social threat protection tool platform. The identity page may include a number of protected users that subscribe to and are protected by the social threat protection tool. The identity page may also include a number of users of the social threat protection tool that have active alerts in addition to an alert history graph . The identity page may also include a list of the users with active alerts . For users with active alerts the identity page may provide details associated with the listed alerts. The identity page may for example identify an imposter account that is associated with a user and that may be posting malware.
