The described embodiments relate generally to electronic communication through cloud networks. More particularly the described embodiments relate to methods systems and apparatuses for a user administrating a trustworthy workspace.

Documents are the new digital currency for online commerce the record of business for online collaboration and the lifeblood of present day business processes. The documents include commercial artifacts such as catalogs offers bids and contracts. Doctors and Bioscientists leverage documents with domain specific formats such as HL7 and medical images. Business networks leverage design extranets through other specialized document types. Aerial surveillance and prospecting requires the sharing and storage of images. In the Pharmaceutical vertical these documents might contain information about DNA sequencing reagent information and components of drug discovery.

The information contained in these documents is usually sensitive business IP or Personally Identifiable Information PII and often content that is highly regulated by perhaps Health and Human Services HIPAA FDA the Office of Currency Comptroller Gramm Leach Bliley or self regulated through consortiums such as the PCI Council. As collaboration becomes global accelerated through cloud enabled geo distribution it is increasingly convenient for producers and consumers buyers and sellers business collaborators and others to leverage cloud based services to effectively share documents through workflows to transact business. This requires the management of the lifecycles of these documents across trust boundaries that might include organizational legal or international boundaries. Emerging cloud solutions have a propensity for reducing costs and optimizing ease of use but if these solutions do not provide sufficient visibility into and control over these regulated assets from inappropriate access or modification by cloud intermediaries there could be significant business and other risks to organizations and their officers.

Efficiency and ease of use is always a high priority since the ability to efficiently share documents with remote collaborators can become a significant business differentiation for any organization or individual who will otherwise not be able to effective capitalize on markets and resources if they do not leverage suitable technologies along with the required ability to protect sensitive business assets. This is an imperative for these organizations and individuals for their business survival. Hence there is a two fold need to enable efficiency and productivity while preserving safety.

Users that include primarily information workers have a need to efficiently author save share locate retrieve archive and dispose documents. Other users such as administrators and regulators have a need to propagate policies and monitor access enforcement. Often there is a trade off between ease of use which is a key underpinning of efficiency and control which is a requirement for administration and regulatory compliance.

Present day systems can usually be grouped under either traditional Enterprise Class systems that are based on servers and services such as Active Directory and SharePoint and emerging Cloud Scale systems such as Dropbox and Box that leverage cloud services for document sharing and identity federation.

The challenge is that traditional systems tend to be brittle antiquated hence unable to address the emerging needs for geo collaboration while emerging systems provide limited functionality and safety. While traditional systems focus on safety and intra prise workflows with limited and complex support for bridging across enterprises through mechanisms such as virtual private networks emerging systems optimize for usability and global sharing and tend to come up short in the areas of access monitoring and enforcement.

The challenge in moving from traditional to emerging solutions is that this generates a schism between the enterprise represented by the IT administrator and GRC on one hand and the information worker on the other. Since documents have a propensity for getting lost retained beyond their specified lifecycle or being inappropriately modified due to negligence accident malice or greed this move to cloud systems poses an immediate risk for enterprises.

These emerging cloud based solutions continue to leverage old style security that relies on the security of hardware and operating systems and continues to require all powerful administrators that can view or modify sensitive data. In some cases these emerging solutions leverage federation mechanisms such as SAML Security Assertion Markup Language to integrate with enterprise policy and identity systems but these are disjoint from the cloud providers own identity and policy systems for their operations staff hence there is no trustworthy mechanism to ensure that the cloud providers actions are compliant with enterprise conveyed policies. Therefore despite any augmentation through the traditional digital equivalents of guard dogs and electric fences it is not practical to administer the administrator in the cloud that might have access to the hardware software or administrative interfaces of the hosted services that are outside the enterprise region of visibility and control.

Hence enterprise customers view these solutions with suspicion. This is for good reason because these cloud service providers are frequent targets of warrants and subpoenas from governments for purposes of law enforcement or surveillance. Since these are often bundled with gag orders with severe penalties for violation the customers may never come to know about who is looking at their sensitive data in documents that are managed through the cloud. Such an example in the United States is the National Security Letter NSL and many other sovereign entities have their own equivalents.

Furthermore despite the theoretical ability of any service provider to provide higher levels of security the critical mass of sensitive data makes them more lucrative targets of criminal and government hackers and the consequence of a single successful intrusion is significantly more devastating.

The conventional Enterprise Class repositories and tools for protecting and managing document lifecycles have organically grown piecemeal with incremental functionality added as needed for backup archival search or rights management. This has resulted in a Rats nest of Enterprise Infrastructures REI . This exacerbates the complexities when access to these repositories needs to be federated across enterprise boundaries or if this hosting or federation is through a cloud service provider. The conventional systems and services were often designed to optimize for functionality rather than ease of use and also for use within a single organization. The access mechanisms for mobile and remote workers often require VPNs and add to a level of complexity that is compounded when information works are collaborating across organizations. When a mobile worker needs to access disparate repositories in distinct enterprises that are silo d this complexity is significantly compounded. In a sense conventional systems are repository centric while the emerging needs are for this to be collaboration centric with the recognition that the collaborators could be working in disparate organizational legal sovereign or geographic regions.

Even though emerging solutions are attempting to jettison some of those archaic complexities of SharePoint and Active Directory they are sometimes continuing to perpetuate old metaphors of networked and distributed file systems for sharing. Therefore there is sometimes a break from convention as is the case with the weaknesses in federation of policy for monitoring and enforcement. But in other cases the vestiges of enterprise style sharing such as those that present users with inconsistent and difficult to use file system sharing semantics detract from the opportunity to provide collaboration centric solutions.

Present and emerging technologies are tending to make the problems of document collaboration worse as sharing solutions such as Dropbox are perpetuating an archaic metaphor of networked and distributed file systems even while solutions such as Apple iOS move to an application centric metaphor which is in turn is a piecemeal solution to device access to documents. Furthermore all of these vendors are creating additional data silos as Apple fuses iCloud into their OS X and iOS offerings while Microsoft does the same with SkyDrive and Windows and Google couples GDrive with Google Apps. Third party sharing solutions such as Dropbox and Box attempt piecemeal integration with the platforms such as OS X iOS and Windows and the applications such as Google Apps but are at business odds with the storage components such as SkyDrive GDrive and iCloud. Hence the present day software and service delivery model is in conflict when these third parties attempt to compete with or dislodge end to end solution stacks from larger vendors such as Apple and Microsoft. All of this detracts from the ability to provide end users with collaboration centric solutions that are agnostic of platforms applications and cloud storage services.

There is an intense and growing need to help the end user to be more productive through document collaboration and to help organizations be more efficient and safe in protecting their digital assets. However it is impractical to consider any forklift changes or expedient global standardizations to improve the existing collective REI. Due to their own business centric needs solution providers are exacerbating the problems by generating more data silos and exacerbating the existing REI. Users are reluctant to change their usage behavior and re training of the workforce would be a significant burden on organizations. Similarly enterprise IT has significant investment in IT infrastructures workflows and IT policies and it would be significantly costly and complex to rip and replace these. Hence for any collaboration centric solution it is necessary to make the integration of any new systems and services occur in a manner that is mostly transparent to IWs Information Workers and IT Managers.

Meanwhile users are under assault from an avalanche of information primarily delivered through documents that they need to generate and share or access and respond to but their jobs are becoming increasingly more difficult since a Windows or Office user is being cajoled to use SkyDrive while a Google Apps customer is being lured toward GDrive. Meanwhile there is an exploding hodgepodge of specialized storage and collaboration services that address real or perceived needs. As a consequence the purported cloud enabled services and tools for simpler cheaper and more efficient collaboration are tending to increase the complexities that users have to face when they need to collaborate with their peers across heterogeneous enterprise or cloud services. One of the consequences is the BYOD rebellion where IWs tend to create grass roots sharing of a single cloud sharing solution despite the security and compliance risks because it bypasses these complexities. However this grass roots model runs into obstacles when the collaborators are on disparate cloud storage and collaboration services and when these collaborators need to access or update documents that held in enterprise repositories and with their collaborators that are continuing to use these enterprise repositories.

It is desirable to have methods systems and apparatuses for a user administrating a trustworthy workspace.

An embodiment includes a method of an operator provisioning a trustworthy workspace to a subscriber. The method includes providing the subscriber with the trustworthy workspace where in the trustworthy workspace comprises a virtualized content repository with trustworthy workflows for storing sharing and processing a digital content across a plurality of repositories. The method further includes allowing the subscriber authority to sub provision the trustworthy workspace to one or more authorized parties wherein only the one or more authorized parties can view or modify at least a portion of the digital content.

Another embodiment includes a system for provisioning a trustworthy workspace to a subscriber. The system includes an operator server operative to provide the subscriber with the trustworthy workspace where in the trustworthy workspace comprises a virtualized content repository with trustworthy workflows for storing sharing and processing a digital content across a plurality of repositories and allow the subscriber authority to sub provision the trustworthy workspace to one or more authorized parties wherein only the one or more authorized parties can view or modify at least a portion of the digital content.

Other aspects and advantages of the described embodiments will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings illustrating by way of example the principles of the described embodiments.

The described embodiments include methods systems and apparatuses for an operator provisioning a trustworthy workspace to a subscriber. The described embodiments address two of the primary obstacles to securely sharing documents across trust boundaries. These are the existence and proliferation of silos of identity authorization Auth AuthZ and the silos of document storage and sharing repositories. The described embodiments provide systems and methods for federating these silos in a manner that reconciles the conflicting requirements of efficiency and security.

The described embodiment for virtualization provides a consistent view of shared storage workflows and policies even though the underlying systems and services are disjoint and disparate. Such a workspace is trustworthy because it provides full fidelity with the access monitoring and enforcement requirements of the underlying repositories and workflows that are owned and administered by the IT of participating enterprises. Such a trustworthy workspace provides a federated and policy based access and enforcement mechanism in contrast with one that is centralized and hence a viable foundation for layering collaboration centric workflows and applications.

The complexities of operations requires the enablement of a syndication model that enables a chain of operators upstream that provisions and supports downstream operators and customers. The furthermost upstream operators are delivered the concrete storage services albeit silo d. Subsequent syndication downstream would add features and functionality. A generic example is Dropbox which is a syndicator of storage from Amazon AWS S3 delivering a simple file sharing service that is accessible through desktop synchronization agents as well as zero footprint browsers. The form of syndication in the case is the ability to syndicate multiple disparate silos of storage and related services that might include AWS S3 Dropbox Box and others along with the associated trustworthiness for access monitoring and enforcement thereby freeing the downstream syndicators and users from unnecessary complexities through this virtualization so that they can focus on delivering additional features and functionality if operators or focus on consumption of storage at a convenient business process level if end users such as focusing on document workflows without needing to know about the underlying storage and communication mechanisms while also being guaranteed safety through trustworthy mechanisms enabled through technologies such as cryptography with appropriate trustworthy key federation.

Further the described embodiments provide abstractions that are convenient to humans including Circles of Trust and Federated Repositories. The described embodiments include mapping of these to underlying social networking rating and identity federation systems such as SAML Security Assertion Markup Language and OAuth Open Standard for Authorization and the document repositories to existing and emerging cloud document sharing repositories such as Dropbox .

The described embodiments accommodate an enterprise need for leveraging of their existing investments in REI previously described Rats nest of Enterprise Infrastructures and possibly large volumes of constituent documents and satisfy a business need to differentiate through quality and functionality of services and the user s need for simplicity of operation that includes making all that REI disappear from their field of perception. Further the described embodiments address a need by users to do their business and conduct their collaboration or commerce workflows through tools that are natural and convenient without needing to be aware of the underlying REI.

The described embodiments provide a purpose built re think of document collaboration and lifecycle management that accommodates REI where necessary since any forklift changes of enterprise infrastructure are impractical. Further for the described embodiments the document or the object is the centerpiece and focus is on the demands that constrain the handling of these objects. Further the describe embodiments include a focus on the various and disparate roles of users with the associated workflows and focus on the claims that dictate what they can do these documents. Further the describe embodiments include carefully leveraging of selected primitives from cryptography a substrate of federated policy for expressive communication of demands and claims and cloud scale systems infrastructure to integrate service providers with consumers.

The proliferation of storage is no longer an issue for the user since each can select their repository of choice or be cajoled or coerced by some application organization or service provider to make a selection such as the integration of iCloud by Apple and Skydrive by Microsoft into their respective products . The describe embodiments include federation of the data path such that the end user or their software surrogate sees a convenient fa ade such as a directory hierarchy in a local file system.

This hierarchy is special in that it may represent a workflow or business process representing perhaps purchasing customer relationship management or supply chains. Associated with these directory hierarchies are actions that are performed in the background in order to suitably handle documents that enter or exit these directories.

At least some of the described embodiments allow leveraging of an off the shelf federated policy language such as DKAL Distributed Knowledge Authorization Language from Microsoft to express these idioms which can be suitably re used extended or otherwise modified or authored.

At least some of the described embodiments leverage the promise of clouds through a syndication friendly solution that delivers a consistent and simple end user experience while facilitating easy integration with existing REI such that enterprises largely retain their existing business processes users have less to learn or worry about.

Present day users tend to create or participate in a multiplicity of communities that might leverage services that range from Facebook and LinkedIn to mailing distribution lists and chat groups. Typically a user might be a member of personal social organizational or business Circles of Trust or Trust Circles that they might leverage to socialize conduct business collaborate or leverage in some form of support system. These are mechanisms for making personal and business connections in a manner that tend to be more comfortable and safe to users since this form of crowdsourcing could be a more convenient mechanism for either building trust or filtering out imposters or those exhibiting undesirable behavior.

Meanwhile enterprises and organizations have favored the centralization of control of Auth AuthZ previously defined where some officially designated individuals or roles will manage the identities and authorization. Typically these are administered through mechanisms such as Active Directory and as these enterprises and organizations do business they leverage mechanisms such as SAML WS Trust or WS Federation to share Auth AuthZ responsibilities. However users including Consumers and Information Workers are increasingly taking identity federation into their own hands through their own Trust Networks.

This circumvention of traditional federated identity is a side effect of BYOD bring your own device since the users are able to collaborate through their own devices through 3 4G networks without the assistance or the permission or knowledge of enterprise IT they are not compelled to deal with the complexities of VPNs and traditional Identity or Resource providers. An IW Information Worker will most likely find it easier and more convenient to locate a collaborator or business partner online through LinkedIn rather than to deal with the complexities of working with their partners administrators to obtain permission to perhaps access a common SharePoint repository through a VPN.

These Trust Circles are not just a convenient mechanism for users to locate each other to build communities of trust and to share documents and best practices but are also excellent mechanisms for vendors to sell products and services. The described embodiments provide other areas of leverage that include layering of Auth AuthZ over existing Trust Circles in a manner that empower Consumers and IWs to participate in becoming collective Identity or Resource Providers. The nature of crowdsourcing is that Identity and Authorization is no longer binary Yes No Expired Revoked instead it is shades of grey since the decision is now more subjective based on feedback or based on the degree of risk of the intended transaction. For example a user may be more discriminating about the rating of the prospective party to interact with if the user believes that they have more to lose if that party were to diverge from specified interaction protocols either accidentally or intentionally.

Leverage of Trust Circles is also an excellent model for integration with service delivery models where a user can be a customer that purchases a service and then leverages a lower cost or free Client Access License CAL to invite members of one of their Trust Circles which reduces friction for the user to generate their desired network effect and for the service provider to obtain market reach. The described embodiments provide seamless integration with not just conventional Auth AuthZ but also Service Syndication and Billing architectures.

The described embodiments provide at least one apparatus and method for integrating conventional Auth AuthZ with emerging crowd sourced Trust Circles through an architecture that leverages a federated policy engine that leverages cryptographic protocols. The engine leverages assertions that might come from a conventional Identity or Resource Provider thereby federating conventional enterprise models such as Role based Access Control RBAC or Claim based Access Control CBAC or other. It also leverages assertions that might come from Consumers or Information Workers through mechanisms such as Endorsements or Ratings. The engine does not need to actually maintain an infrastructure for RBAC CBAC Endorsements or Ratings but can integrate through adapters with existing products or services.

In the present day there is a land grab where a variety and diversity of service providers are delivering an avalanche of document sharing and collaboration services. These include SkyDrive and GDrive which are integrated by its suppliers into their operating systems or applications and a groundswell of new services that range from Dropbox for file sharing to Jive for business networks.

The primary need for any user is to be able to easily locate and work with other users and to be able to create locate save and share documents. Documents have identities that might be some function of contents location and metadata. Users similarly have attributes that are obtained through Trust Circles that was described previously. The virtualization of repositories complements this by easing the location storage or sharing of documents in a manner that is independent of the specific repositories.

The silos and fragmentation of repositories is not just hidden from the user by lower level software and protocols but can be used to the user s advantage since it is possible for the intermediation to optimize for location service quality or costs. It can also create replicas or archives that straddle more than one location or repository in order to add incremental value such as resilience availability or tamper resistance.

Further the describe embodiments provide at least one method and apparatus for virtualizing repositories through the leverage of that underlying federated policy engine with cryptographic protocols and through utilization of existing APIs provided by AnyBox providers such as Dropbox Box Google Drive Microsoft SkyDrive and others and standard abstractions such as WebDAV Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning from the IETF Internet Engineering Task Force a community based organization for recommending Internet standards . The federated policy engine utilizes Infons and Substrates as described below to preserve the existing repositories APIs and client interfaces but is able to perform cloud scale integration that can be efficient resilient and secure while shielding the user from the complexities and idiosyncrasies of the individual repositories.

The technological primitives primarily consist of federated policy engines that are augmented with cryptographic primitives. These are used to share assertions capabilities and payloads. Payloads are the actual documents Assertions signify policies and constraints Capabilities provide permissions to locate and access Payloads.

End points are built out of these engines and reside within organizations and service providers SCAs end users CCAs and are hosted in cloud and network services that are potentially geo distributed. These end points are leveraged to construct data control and provenance paths.

The data paths facilitate bridging of disparate repositories the control paths enable consistent enforcement of demands and claims the provenance paths provide visibility into assertions and their veracity and contracts and associated adherence. The describe embodiments provide a data path for virtualizing storage repositories to address the silos and fragmentation.

Any user will select their document sharing repository of choice without any need to normalize their selection with other users and will enroll in this federated system. Organizations will have a similar need to select or even host their document sharing repository without the need to normalize this with the selections of their peer organizations associations regulators or sovereign entities. Service providers can provide federated services that either enhance data provenance and data privacy or add arbitrary workflow capabilities and thereby differentiate themselves through value

When a user enrolls in the system their devices leverage a client side agent that participates in the federation but with minimal involvement by that user. If the user is a member of an organization or realm that user s agent may receive assertions from the parent organization or the resource provider that owns a specific document that in context and that agent may propagate provenance information to authorized parties regarding access or modification.

The user is presented with a simple and consistent usage metaphor and the one currently in vogue is a file system integrated experience where placing documents in a folder results in the initiation of a workflow and these folders will host new or modified documents to appear due to remote user actions. The most basic workflows are document sharing that are similar to those performed by Dropbox but in a manner that virtualizes these repositories such that one user might leverage Dropbox while a collaborator might leverage Box or Skydrive or AnyBox .

As collaborators grow more documents come in play hence increased concurrency and conflicting changes. Whereas a baseline Dropbox policy would excavate these conflicts to the user to merge a more convenient set of policies might eliminate this through workflows where a document is forwarded to the appropriate reviewer or approver in a specific sequence such that inappropriate conflicts are minimized or eliminated. Users meanwhile can be oblivious of the complex workflows and will just use the appropriate folders to send receive or track progress of workflows.

Folders can have ancillary actions associated with them which might include the creation of backups the update of some remote reference repository or archive or the execution of filters and actions for generating logs or alerts. The CCAs or Client Connect Agents which are off cloud software or hardware components that reside on client laptops and devices such as tablets or smart phones act as enforcement points that perform these filters and actions while there are associated SCAs or Server Connect Agents which are off cloud software or hardware components that reside within customer data centers that define these filters and actions which are conveyed as assertions and policies between SCAs and CCAs and between SCAs .

Just as CCAs integrate with the end user experience or with existing applications that might access and modify documents in these special folders without knowledge of the publish and subscribe semantics the associated SCAs integrate with existing REI to integrate with existing directories policy authoring and decision points and logging or alert aggregation infrastructures. An example of an SCA might be one that integrates with selected document repositories within a SharePoint server within an enterprise and keeps versions of documents in sync between these and peer repositories residing on AnyBox with the associated security mechanisms such as encryption decryption and signing verification such that documents that exit from SharePoint to AnyBox are just as safe as those residing within.

The current emergence of BYOD consumer grade file sharing is a reaction to and a rebellion against the complexities of existing REI that forces complex client side software for creating VPNs and forces choices of client side platform software. The baby that is tossed with the bathwater is the huge base of existing documents that currently reside in existing file systems and document repositories such as SharePoint and Documentum.

The SCA is similar in function to the CCA but is specialized to have knowledge of these repositories through a custom provider model such that these existing enterprise file servers and SharePoint repositories can become end points in that seamless user collaboration. In this model existing users and software will continue to access existing enterprise repositories while the SCAs will serve as a trustworthy two way bridge for propagating data control and provenance with other SCAs and CCAs. Typically data might constitute documents being shared and control might consist of policies and cryptographic material such as encrypted keys or signatures and provenance is typically cryptographically verified proofs of the antecedents of the data or control information.

Enterprises have their own mechanisms for managing identity and authorization. These might be based on Active Directory and Kerberos. In these cases the access control is enforced by the document containers such as file systems and SharePoint which are kerberized for federating within an organization. As these enterprises and organizations federate for business there are emerging standards and infrastructures for federating across organizations. These range from SAML OASIS and WS Trust WS Federation Web Consortium to PKI and hybrids.

These federation mechanisms attempt to tame the complexities of REI silos but do not provide any guarantees regarding misuse of assets by remote collaborators. The SCA is also designed to integrate with these enterprise directories and security policies such that the group memberships and evictions are enforced for that organization s assets documents anywhere in the federated data paths. As a consequence administrators and regulators continue to leverage their existing mechanisms for specifying policy and memberships and mechanisms for viewing logs and alerts while their SCAs translate these into assertions and receives logs and alerts from remote SCAs and CCAs.

The twin benefits of the SCAs is that the REI can exist in place without the need for additional complexity due to the proliferation of document sharing data silos and enterprise administrators and regulators do not need to acquire any new skills or encounter any new complexities. Moving forward there is an opportunity for enterprises to selectively and deliberately whittle down this REI because the visibility and control can be enabled through an SCA Lite that can reside on a mobile device since the cryptographic operations enable offload of significant functionality to the cloud in a trustworthy manner.

The core component for federation of data control and provenance across SCA and CCA endpoints mediated through CCS Cloud Connect Service service providers is a federated policy engine.

Present day computing infrastructures that were designed for enterprises have difficulties accommodating cloud hosting and services because they are inherently distributed in that there is a need for centralized parties that are usually fully trusted that will host and manage the sharing of documents and the federation of identity and authorization. While this has mostly worked for traditional Intra prise scenarios i.e. within a single organization this does not scale when there are multiple organizations and individuals working across trust boundaries hence unable or unwilling to trust a single centralized party for managing identities authorization keys policies logging and enforcement.

Policy engines tend to be similar in that they require centralized engines that are fully trusted. There are new generations of policy engines such as DKAL from Microsoft that are intrinsically federated in that they leverage an underpinning of knowledge of who can say what and what is known rather than what is true .

DKAL operates on primitives termed Infons and Substrates. At its core an Infon is a message that is exchanged between end points that could extend the knowledge of the recipient s and a Substrate is a repository of information that is another candidate source of knowledge. At least some of the described embodiments leverage and extend these Infons and Substrates through cryptographic techniques to represent attestations of what needs to be done demands what a principal is authorized to do claims and what transpired logs and alerts . At least some of the described embodiments also modify and extend DKAL for performance and efficiency.

DKAL was designed to integrate with existing federation infrastructures such as SAML such that an Infon a message that is exchanged between end points that could extend the knowledge of the recipient s can represent a SAML claim and with emerging policy federation standards such as XACML eXtensible Access Control Markup Language from Oasis such that DKAL can integrate with peer policy decision points PDPs and enforcement points PEPs by serving as a PDP to remote XACML PEPs and as a PEP to remote XACML PDPs.

At least some of the described embodiments integrate Authorization Enforcement engine that integrates federated policy and cryptography we term a TrustNode. A TrustNode consists of a cryptographic engine that currently leverages OpenSSL and a lightweight inference engine. There is a TrustNode that is resident within every CCA SCA and CCS. This TrustNode also contains a credential vault and a directory for storing signed public keys and encrypted secret keys. It also contains a policy store that consists of a Substrate and an Infostrate.

Policy Infons and Substrates are generated through an SCA Adapter that knows about existing policy repositories through an adapter that integrates with an existing Policy Authoring Point or through an adapter that integrates with other policy engines such as XACML eXtensible Access Control Markup Language .

Policy Infons and Substrates codify claims such as employment group membership or administrative roles and demands such as Role Based Access Claims based Access or other resource access restrictions . These Infons are also designed to integrate with emerging cryptographic techniques such as Cipher text Policy or Key Policy Attribute based Encryption where the former might represent demands and the latter claims .

Infons and Substrates also codify behavior. A Behavioral Infon is a declarative prescription of the actions that need to be performed when a document is added to an associated folder. It may specify the type of cryptographic techniques to be applied perhaps for non repudiation and privacy the required security strength it may also specify associated obligations such as logging and alerts. There may be other obligations such as the need to archive or quarantine block that document if it triggers any specified patterns.

Behavioral Infons also specify the target repository or repositories for an outbound document based on its federated substrate that is able to locate and associate preferred data repositories of the recipient or that recipient s organization. In this regard the substrate functions as a federated directory for documents and principals.

Documents that are associated with demands and cryptographically protected are also Infons in this system. A Document Infon typically consists of an encrypted payload that represents the original document and an associated header that contains demands and capabilities. Typically the demands are delivered to the CCA and optionally to a remote Mediator who will need to agree to co operate based on their respective Substrate and Infostrate content. A successful mediation unlocks the capabilities in the header that will give the intended recipient access to the payload.

Finally Infons and the contents of Substrates also codify actions that occurred such as documents that were sent or received. These Infon Logs are cryptographically attested and protected records of actions that occurred and are tamper evident. All types of Infons are tamper evident and the architecture also accommodates tamper prevention of Infons. At least one benefit of the described embodiments includes the ability for individuals and organizations to leverage the benefits of clouds and other networks which include lower costs higher scale and geo distribution in order to maximize their own efficiencies that might include lower capital and operational expenses.

There exist several collaboration and commerce networks that can benefit from the lower costs scale and geo distribution of clouds. These networks include supply and demand chains and international trade. In the present day there is a precise support system that includes banks escrow parties shipping corporations and mediation. However these do not scale for electronic commerce when it is necessary for a human to be a mandatory intermediary for any typical transaction as opposed to a human needing to get involved in the case of an error or a conflict .

Due to the replacement of that the previously described messy crossbar with a trustworthy hub it is now easier for diverse technologies and solutions to integrate and inter operate since each spoke needs to perform a one time integration with the trustworthy hub. In addition it is possible for the hub to present a variety of interfaces to the spokes and then perform the routing and inter operation within the hub. In deployment scenarios with multiple hubs each hub might implement a specific class of technologies.

Whereas present day distributed architectures are stilted due to the need to protect data through the containers that they reside in the enablement of visibility and control facilitates the caching of electronic content closer to the expected consumer which optimizes the data path whereas the control path for key access and for metering is easier to optimize for cloud scale. This provides the underpinning for new architectures that enable higher scale and greater efficiency noting that the current corporate and Internet traffic is dominated by video and file sharing.

As will be described the virtual content workspace can be managed by one or more servers of a custodian which manage the plurality of repositories and can further manage workflows . For an embodiment the one or more servers of the custodian are network connected to the plurality of repositories . Further the one or more servers of the custodian are network connected to servers of parties such as party A and party B of later discussion and to servers of other custodians such as higher level custodians discussed later . The other trustworthy workspaces can be similarly managed maintained and controlled by other custodian servers. Further the one or more servers of a custodian can be network connected to servers of curators. The described methods of operation can be implemented through software operating on one or more of the described servers or computing devices.

For an embodiment an operator is able to provide a subscriber with at least a portion of the trustworthy workspace of the virtualized content repository as depicted by the trustworthy work space2 . Further the subscriber is provided with the authority to sub provision the trustworthy workspace2 to one or more authorized parties as depicted by the trustworthy workspace3 and the trustworthy workspace4 . For an embodiment only the one or more authorized parties can view or modify at least a portion of the digital content of the trustworthy workspace3 and the trustworthy workspace4 .

It is to be understood that while the trustworthy workflows are figuratively depicted as being associated with the trustworthy workspace 1 the trustworthy workspace2 and the trustworthy workspace3 are provisioned from the trustworthy workspace 1 and therefore for at least some embodiments the trustworthy workflows are associated with the trustworthy workspace2 and or the trustworthy workspace3 .

For at least some embodiments an operator is an organization that provides a cloud service to its customers with some or all of associated services such as provisioning metering billing and customer support and others. Examples of operators include document sharing operators such as AnyBox . Other operators might provide services such as identity federation.

A Virtualized content repository is virtual in that it is a composite of one or more discrete and real repositories and contains some combination of hardware software and service components that provide an aggregate common and consistent interface to the consumer of that virtualized repository such that the consumer continues to use the underlying concrete repositories but is shielded from the specifics and perhaps limitations of the underlying repositories. For instance such virtualization might mask the fact that the underlying concrete repositories are geo distributed across the globe while the virtualization provides the consumer with the best performance based on their specific location. Other virtualization aspects might normalize the user experience the manageability experience or other aspects of the underlying repositories such that the consumer is provided with a common consistent and hopefully simple access interface.

An example of plurality of repositories includes a collection of document sharing repositories from Dropbox Box SkyDrive GDrive and Amazon S3. Furthermore some of these repositories might host multiple disparate locations. An aggregation from this plurality might select from disparate storage providers and disparate geographic locations such that the consumer of the overlaid virtual repository might perhaps be provided with higher levels of reliability and availability since their data might reside in multiple copies across different repositories and perhaps more competitive pricing if the virtualization layer might pick from the repository vendors that are providing the most competitive pricing for the desired value.

As described at least some embodiments allow the subscriber authority to sub provision the trustworthy workspace to one or more authorized parties. Provisioning is a process where an operator would make some portion of their trustworthy workspace to one or more of their customers. It is possible for any of those customers to serve as an operator and to sub provision portions of that trustworthy workspace that was provisioned previously to them.

Examples of trustworthy workflows might include supply chains marketplaces auctions and extranets. All of these involve the sharing of sensitive business data such as design documents offers bids contracts etc. It is a business imperative for participants in these workflows to protect themselves from accidental or intentional deviation from these workflows for reasons that might include fraud. It is also a similar business imperative for these participants to prove to their business partners that they have correctly participated in these workflows. Workflows are everywhere and range from paper with conventional mail exchange to end to end electronic workflows that sometimes leverage VANs Value Add Networks. All of these workflows tend to be prone to failures and tend to be difficult to protect against misbehavior and accident by participants that could consequently lead to business loss. Trustworthy workflows leverage cryptography including primitives such as signing encryption and others. These cryptographic controls provide an enhanced degree of trust across participants. Since trust is grounded in the physical world and is a function of relationships history of interaction contracts etc trustworthiness is defined to be an intrinsic property of the cryptographically enabled workflows to express that the trust is replaced by the intrinsic trustworthiness of the cryptographic primitives that preclude participants from cheating.

For at least some embodiments only the one or more authorized parties can view or modify at least a portion of the digital content. That is only the authorized parties are able to participate in the trustworthy workflows .

For an embodiment the authorized parties are determined by a vetting engine . The vetting engine receives parties and qualifies or vets the parties based on information of the parties. The information includes for example identities reputations and or associations of the parties.

Such a vetting engine might leverage big data analytics to glean information from disparate sources that might include feedback from users in the system. Based on the available data it might leverage rules and heuristics to suggest a level of trust that might be assigned to an individual or organization .

The results of vetting of the parties can be leveraged by for example other subscribers or for example for the determination of authorized parties to different trusted workspaces. Further for at least some embodiments the vetting of the parties provides a level of trustworthiness of each of the parties. For an embodiment the vetting is transitive since a subscriber will trust the vetting process of another subscriber based on the first subscriber s trust in the second. The vetting engine of the first subscriber can incorporate this degree of trust into the act of importing and acting on the vetting information propagated by the second subscriber.

For an embodiment the one or more authorized parties include at least one of a publisher or a consumer of the digital content or an administrator of the trustworthy workspace.

An embodiment further includes providing the subscriber with the trustworthy workspace includes the operator providing the subscriber with a primary workspace wherein the subscriber has a delegated authority to create nested trustworthy workspaces or groups thereby allowing subsets of the one or more authorized parties to access digital content shared with each nested trustworthy workspace reside across the plurality of repositories.

For an embodiment the authority to provision the trustworthy workspace includes access controls and authorization which enables the authorized parties to provide at least an electronic identification such as an email address a cell phone number etc. of another party which triggers an automated trustworthy workflow to invite and enroll the other party and to facilitate the other party joining the trustworthy workspace. For an embodiment the authority to provision the trustworthy workspace to the one or more authorized parties includes allowing the one or more authorized parties to at least one of create enable access delete change monitor the electronic content in the trustworthy workspace.

At least one embodiment further includes facilitating the subscriber in vetting one or more other parties before allowing the one or more other parties to access the trustworthy workspace based on information of the one or more other parties wherein the one or more other parties become authorized parties if vetted more than a threshold. For at least some embodiments the information of the one or more other parties includes at least identities of the one or more other parties. For at least some embodiments the information further includes at least one of reputations associations of the one or more other parties.

For at least some embodiments the methods and processes for identities leverages integration with SAML OAuth and other mechanisms as described previously. The methods and processes for obtaining reputations and associations are specific to the workflows. For example in a marketplace scenario the input might be obtained from rating systems in silo marketplaces such as EBay and Amazon. If this were a business extranet scenario then there would be services that would enable partners to provide feedback on each other. It is commonplace today to observe a growing number of such services where there are even a multitude of services for patients to rate doctors or for students to rate teachers. Similarly in International Trade and Global Commerce these services for providing ratings and associations can be leveraged for computing the consequent reputations in the vetting process.

At least some embodiments further include allowing other subscribers to leverage vetting of at least some of the one or more other parties based on prior vetting by the subscriber. For at least some embodiments leveraging includes providing the ability for any subscriber to release the output of their vetting process to other subscribers to leverage in their vetting engines. This is similar in concept to the rating system of EBay for instance but the orchestration is federated in that there is on central party that needs to host this information thereby also being in a position to filter or modify the feedback due to either coercion malice or for profit . Furthermore for an embodiment the publisher of this information leverages a certain level of anonymization in order to protect their won identity against perhaps repercussion. Consequently this anonymity might deem the feedback to be less believable. Hence the vetting engines leverages statistics and also co relates to filter out feedback that might be deliberately duplicated or apparently falsified.

For at least some embodiments a level of vetting influences a level of trustworthiness associated with each of the one or more other parties and wherein the vetting further comprises accessing information from a plurality of sources including social networking and reference sources. Typically the requisite level of trustworthiness is subjective and hence depends on the level of risk that the first party is willing to take. In addition the level of trustworthiness depends on the sensitivity of the transaction being considered and the consequent degree of loss if there is accident or malice in the actions of the other party. For example one might require higher level of trustworthiness from a diamond merchant than from a vendor of office supplies.

For at least some embodiments the trustworthy workspace includes one or more policies wherein the one or more policies include actions to be taken for publishing and consuming digital content to and from the trustworthy workspace. For at least some embodiments the actions include at least one of data classification encryption signing rights management routing quarantine log archive replication disposition or redaction of the digital content.

For at least some embodiments the trustworthy workspace comprises management of a plurality of different repositories and the trustworthy workspace is presented to the operator as a single unified management interface while utilizing the plurality of different repositories. For example Dropbox and Box have dissimilar mechanisms for provisioning users with their own storage within an account. Therefore if an administrator faces compounding of complexities if they needed to have knowledge of every such service especially when these services are multiplying and attempting to differentiate through features that include manageability. On the other hand the virtualization of provisioning provides a consistent fa ade that bypasses these complexities.

For at least some embodiments the trustworthy workspace comprises management of a plurality of different repositories and the trustworthy workspace is presented to the subscriber as a single unified workspace while utilizing the plurality of different repositories.

As will be described in detail for an embodiment the trustworthy workflows include providing trustworthy workflow across trust boundaries between a first party A and a second party B. Further as will be described for an embodiment trustworthy workflows include monitoring and controlling access to an electronic content.

For at least some embodiments the trustworthy workspace comprises a directory. For at least some embodiments the directory trustworthy directory includes a known common location such as an IP address or http URL for a subscriber to publish any information for use by another subscriber in a common format and vocabulary such that the other subscriber gets a complete unrestricted and untampered view of what was published. For at least some embodiments the subscriber is not prevented from publishing to the directory. For at least some embodiments erasure coding and dispersal enable records of the trustworthy directory to remain intact even when attempts are made to destroy. For at least some embodiments authenticated data structures enable detection of records of the trustworthy directory that are inserted or deleted separately.

For at least some embodiments the directory enables a trustworthy mechanism for a user to discover other users. For at least some embodiments the subscriber who discovers or queries the directory can do so while being maintaining the anonymity of the subscriber and the privacy of the query. This trustworthy mechanism comprises of cryptographic signing verification and encryption decryption of the records of the trustworthy directory.

For at least some embodiments the trustworthy workspace further includes a messaging service which leverages the directory to enable the subscriber to discover other subscribers or users who have not yet subscribed and further includes determining if the users who have not yet subscribed are authorized and inviting the users who have not yet subscribed to join the trustworthy workspace and to become subscribers. For at least some embodiments subscribers have authorization to access and use the trustworthy workspace. For at least some embodiments the subscribers have authorization to access and use the trustworthy workspace wherein access and use includes an ability to send and receive messages.

At least some embodiments further include allowing a recipient to associate a rating with a sender based on the content of message received through the messaging service. For at least some embodiments a recipient who receives an unsolicited message may mark that sender as being undesirable or low value and therefore associate a low rating that can be referenced by other subscribers. At least some embodiments further include aggregating of ratings and enabling a policy on the sender to disallow or reduce an importance of messages being sent by the sender. For at least some embodiments the aggregating includes an aggregation of individual ratings by multiple recipients to influence the rating. The credibility of the rating improves with the number of ratings for a sender. At least some embodiments further include allowing the recipient to associate the rating with the sender based on credentials used by the sender to verify themselves to the workspace. For at least some embodiments a credential is an assertion by an external identity provider. For at least some embodiments the credential includes one or more of a secret passphrase or a SmartCard. At least some embodiments further include rating the sender based on a number of recipients and a frequency of messages sent by the sender. For an embodiment the frequency of messages is the number of messages within a certain epoch. At least some embodiments further include allowing the recipient to associate a personal rating to the sender of an email to blacklist the sender.

As shown for at least one embodiment the one or more custodians have access to a cloud connect service CCS one or more curators have access to a service connect agent SCA and the first party A and the second party B have access to client connect agents CCA .

For at least some embodiments a curator includes organizations or individuals who are the owners of information and its associated management access policies. As shown the one or more curators generating a first public key PK and a second public key PK which are then published. The first public key PK and the second public key PK have a corresponding secret first secret key SK and a second secret key SK which the one or more curators maintain as a secret.

The one or more curators also generate a first proxy re encryption key RK and a second proxy re encryption key RK . While this embodiment includes two proxy re encryption keys it is to be understood that other embodiments include any possible number of proxy re encryption keys. For at least some embodiments of this example the one or more curators generate the second proxy re encryption key RK based on a public key Pkobtained from the one or more custodians. That is the one or more curators generate the second proxy re encryption key RK without knowledge of the secret key SKof the second party B.

For one embodiment the first proxy re encryption key RK and the second proxy re encryption key RK are both generated by a single curator. Further the corresponding secret first secret key SK and a second secret key SK can be generated by the single curator. For another embodiment the first proxy re encryption key RK is generated by a first curator and the second proxy re encryption key RK is generated by a second curator. Further the corresponding first secret key SK can be generated by the first curator and a second secret key SK can be generated by the second curator. The multiple multiple hop proxy re encryption of the described embodiments is advantageous because it provides for the federation of enforcement of policies across trust boundaries.

The first party A encrypts data d using a block cipher key k denoted as din the Figures then encrypts k using the first public key PK denoted as kin and that is to eventually be received by the second party B.

The one or more custodians receive the encrypted data from the first party A as well as the encrypted k. For at least some embodiments a custodian includes cloud service providers.

The one or more custodians then perform a two hop as previously described any number of hops can be utilized proxy re encryption process. Additionally the proxy re encryption of each hop is one way. That is custodians that have an RKthat atomically re encrypts from PKto PKmust not have the reverse permission of re encrypting from PKto PK since this violates the privacy of the owner of PK.

More specifically the one or more custodians proxy re encrypt k from the first public key PK to the second public key PK using the first proxy re encryption key RK wherein the first proxy re encryption is one way and then the one or more custodians proxy re encrypt k from the second public key PK to a public key PK of the second party B using the second proxy re encryption key RK wherein the second proxy re encryption is one way. Therefore k is re encrypted to B s public key PK denoted as kin and without k ever being decrypted in between the steps in which the data passes through one or more custodians .

A valuable feature of the proxy re encryption system and method is that the one or more custodians are never able to decrypt k nor the data d. Additionally because the one or more curators do not have the secret key SKof the second party B the one or more curators are not able to obtain the block cipher key k to decrypt the data. Additionally the one or more custodian in conjunction with the one or more curators are not able to decrypt the data d. Further if party B were to collude with any of the custodians they would not be able to recover party A s secret key SKor any curator s secret key.

For an embodiment the one or more curators includes a plurality of curators acting as one or more Policy Administration Points PAP and one or more Policy Decision Points PDP for one or more enterprises across trust boundaries. Further the plurality of curators prevent the one or more custodians acting as one or more Policy Enforcement Points PEP from accessing or tampering content of policies of the plurality of curators while enforcing the policies across the plurality of curators. For at least some embodiments the policy enforcement actions performed by one or more custodians are non repudiable and tamper proof. At least some embodiments include the plurality of curators translating the policies into the generation of the first public key PK the second public key PK the first secret key SK the second secret key SK . For at least some embodiments there can be multiple public keys PKs and secret key SKs for each policy and not every policy needs a proxy re encryption key RK.

For at least some embodiment publishing the first public key PK and the second public key PK includes the plurality of curators sending the first public key PK and the second public key PK to the one or more custodians. Further at least some embodiments include the plurality of curators requesting for policy enforcement comprising publishing the first proxy re encryption key RK and the second proxy re encryption key RK to one or more custodians and sending requests to perform one or more proxy re encryption operations to the one or more custodians. Further at least some embodiments include the one or more custodians enforcing the policies by performing the proxy re encrypting of k from the first public key PK to the second public key PK and proxy re encrypting k from the second public key PK to a public key PK .

The second party B receives the encrypted data and is able to obtain the block cipher key k using the second party B s secret key Sk and thus decrypt the data d 

As shown the first party A has access to a client connect agent CCA and the second party B has access to a client connect agent CCA . An embodiment of CCA can be an independent software application program running in party A or B s computing device such as desktop laptop mobile device etc. Another embodiment of CCA is operable to run within a web browser.

The described embodiment provide systems methods and apparatuses that address the twin requirements of a limiting cloud service providers power to becoming just a full fidelity policy enforcement point in the cloud with plausible deniability of any policy or data access and b designing its integration points with any organization and its business partners in a manner that enables low impact integration and re use of infrastructure process training and personnel within the organization and its business partners.

In one embodiment if the enterprise is leveraging PKI and X.509v3 certificates the CCS can integrate with OCSP Online Certificate Status Protocol or it can obtain and parse CRLs Certificate Revocation Lists so that it comes to know when users are revoked or have compromised their credentials and it can immediately act by refusing to perform a proxy re encryption operation. Therefore this trustworthy workflow is not just efficient but also more secure because revocations can be near instantaneous. Furthermore since all documents are only accessed after a proxy re encryption is performed the CCS can also serve as a fine grain audit point that can generate logs of document access and enable the owning organization to have visibility into how documents are being shared or modified and forwarded. Finally the CCS is a higher scale and federated hence inter operable component of a Rights Management Solution with the enhancement of being a complete lifecycle management solution that can manage end to end document retention disposition and hold across trust boundaries whereas existing Rights Management solutions have stilted policies that are typically limited within one domain and do not scale. Because of this combination of visibility through audit logs and control through end to end lifecycle management the CCS is an enabler of organization GRC that includes Legal monitoring supervision surveillance litigation support and Compliance Confidentiality Availability Integrity and other requirements. 

To implement the policy enforcement mechanism in the cloud through the CCS the described embodiments include a primitive called a Mediation Rule which is an atomic policy statement. It is implemented using a cryptographic technique called Proxy Re Encryption where the Mediation Rule is manifested as a Proxy Re Encryption Key.

For at least some embodiments any policy that includes Identity Authorization and Access Control can be expressed in the form of Mediation Rule primitives similar to a compilation target in a programming language. These Mediation Rules are created by off cloud curators or are automatically generated by adapters within the local organizational SCA based on policies that are stored in IT infrastructures such as AD ADFS or LDAP. The CCS has the restricted ability to only act upon a policy that is embodied through a Mediation Rule.

An example of a Mediation Rule for Authorization is a Proxy Re encryption key from a group to an individual of that group which can be referred to as Claims Groups since they mirror Identity and Authorization Claims. The Claims Group demarcates the set of users that have the authorization to perform some operation typically Create Read Update or Delete on a set of objects that are delegated to that group. All these objects are encrypted to the public key of that group and users are authorized to be part of that group through the presence of a Mediation Rule a Proxy Re Encryption key in the embodiments described that will be in the possession of the CCS so that it can enforce that policy to provide any user with access to those objects. For at least some embodiments the CCS can only apply the Mediation Rule it cannot create new Mediation Rules and it cannot ignore or refuse to apply Mediation Rules without detection.

An example of a Mediation Rule for Access Control is a group that is used to stage documents that have a specific classification. For example This HBI Group holds all documents that have High Business Impact . The associated Mediation Rule is a Proxy Re encryption Key that translates any document that is encrypted to the public key of this group that is termed a Demand Group to some claims group such as Auditors. Suppose Bob is a member of the Auditors group and Alice publishes a document to the HBI Group an administrator would have generated a REK Proxy Re Encryption Key from the HBI Group to the Auditors Group. Separately that administrator or possibly a different administrator would have generated a REK from the Auditors Group to Bob s Public Key. If multiple administrators are involved they can belong to one curator or multiple curators as described in at least some embodiments.

There are several significant advantages to this approach that include the fact that there is no group secret to cache and re use hence other than the group owner no one else in the trustworthy workflow can define or control the policy of the group. Another benefit is that the REK is a business record that can be archived in a tamper proof manner using other cryptographic and other techniques so that it is easy to determine the existence of any policy or the absence thereof at any time in order to support GRC requirements such as discovery.

For at least some embodiments there can even be Mediation Rules for Identity where an enhanced Identity Provider STS Security Token Services is able to authenticate a user only if it has a REK for that user. This illustrates how a single atomic Mediation Rule can serve as a compilation target for complex enterprise Identity Authorization Access Control and other policies. XACML is a blueprint and language for federation of policy and in this blueprint the CCS is a Policy Enforcement Point PEP while the Policy Decision Points and Policy Authoring Points remain unchanged and within the trust boundaries of the respective organizations. The pivotal difference is that the PEPs of the described embodiments that are implemented through Mediation Rules cannot violate the Mediation Rules that are provided to them.

While some of the described embodiments may confine their exposition to typical enterprise policies that include Identity Authorization and Access Enforcement the Mediation Rule primitive is even more expressive and is able to provide the CCS with additional functionalities that might include contract mediation fair exchange and international trade. Since a Mediation Rule cannot provide the CCS with direct access to data and since the CCS can be designed to record these Mediation Rules in a repository in a tamper resistant manner these Mediation Rules are business records that can provide proof of the existence of a policy at a particular time. While there have been technologies that may have been amenable to constructing Mediation Rules in the literature in the last few years there has been a lack of technologies that can facilitate non interactive one way collusion resistant delegation resistant and multi hop Mediation. Without one or more of these features this primitive would be unable to represent organizational policy with full fidelity and any solution that is not complete in that there is some room for human error or misbehavior then that would risk the viability and headroom for that solution.

As shown the trustworthy workflow is the new model of enabling security through carefully designed and implemented cryptography federated key lifecycle management federated policy and federated reputation networks through cloud such that sensitive information such as data keys and policies is only accessible within a trust boundary while the encrypted data and keys can be stored by the custodians and the policies associated data management and access can be enforced by the custodians across trust boundaries. The custodians are cryptographically prevented from accessing the data the keys and the policies and from releasing them to unauthorized entities.

Multiple curators are sometimes necessarily for managing hierarchical organizations. For example in a typical organization there may be a top level Company Full time Employees group then a US Head Office nested group and in turn an Engineering nested group. Within the Engineering group there could be some user named Joe . The translation from any parent group to contained group one curator to another is a hop and the translation from the lowest contained group to the user Joe is the final hop from Curator 3 to party B . Hence it can be quite useful to support multiple hops.

In yet another use case of multiple curators party A could be a white collar employee AKA IW or Information Worker in some organization. She has an organizational relationship with a Curator 1 that represents the authority within their own organization that is involved with classifying and safeguarding their own documents. Party B might be another IW within that same organization. It might also be an IW in a different organization which has its own curator Curator 3 . Now Curator 3 is responsible for managing the organizational hierarchy the groups nesting of groups memberships within groups etc. . . . whereas Curator 1 is responsible for managing and classifying documents. Hence Curator 1 is in the world of what is referred to as Demand Groups a Demand is the inverse of a Claim and conveys what the requirements are for getting access to a document within that kind of group . Multi hop Proxy Re encryption across multiple curators become necessary to enforce policies across organization or trust boundaries.

Generally for an embodiment the log data includes a listing of activities of an associated party or a curator and a description of data sent or received by the associated party or a curator. This embodiment is similar to the described embodiments. However the date that is initially encrypted is log data rather than data and the regulator replaces the role of the second party B. The embodiment allows the regulator to regulate or monitor the log data of the first party A.

As described the method of providing trustworthy workflow across trust boundaries between a first party A and a second party B includes multiple hops. That is a first hop is provided by the one or more custodians proxy re encrypting k from the first public key PK to the second public key PK using the first proxy re encryption key RK and a second hop is provided by the one or more custodians proxy re encrypting k from the second public key PK to a public key PK of the second party B using the second proxy re encryption key RK . Other embodiments can include more than two hops. For at least some embodiments the proxy re encryption being one way includes the one or more curators generating the proxy re encryption key utilizing a cryptographic one way function. For a more specific embodiment the cryptographic one way function includes a cryptographic pairing and wherein the proxy re encryption is restricted to be one way.

For at least some embodiments the one or more curators includes a plurality of curators wherein the plurality of curators act as one or more Policy Administration Points PAP and one or more Policy Decision Points PDP for one or more enterprises across trust boundaries and further prevent the one or more custodians acting as one or more Policy Enforcement Points PEP from accessing or tampering content of policies of the plurality of curators while enforcing the policies across the plurality of curators. For an embodiment policy enforcement actions performed by one or more custodians are non repudiable and tamper proof. For an embodiment the plurality of curators translate the policies into the generation of the first public key PK the second public key PK the first secret key SK the second secret key SK . For an embodiment for each policy there are multiple public keys PKs and secret keys SKs but every policy does not need to have a proxy re encryption key RK. For an embodiment publishing the first public key PK and the second public key PK includes the plurality of curators sending the first public key PK and the second public key PK to the one or more custodians. An embodiment further includes the plurality of curators requesting for policy enforcement including publishing the first proxy re encryption key RK and the second proxy re encryption key RK to the one or more custodians and sending requests to perform one or more proxy re encryption operations to the one or more custodians. An embodiment further includes the one or more custodians enforcing the policies by performing the proxy re encrypting of k from the first public key PK to the second public key PK and proxy re encrypting k from the second public key PK to a public key PK .

For an embodiment the one or more curators include a single curator. For another embodiment the one or more curators include a plurality of curators.

For an embodiment the one or more custodians include a single custodian. For another embodiment the one or more custodian comprises a plurality of custodian and wherein a custodian can be instantiated by one public or private cloud provider. With multiple custodians each custodian can be an organization or an individual that can enjoy a higher level of availability performance flexibility and mobility of a cloud network as well as price arbitrage.

For an embodiment the one or more curators generate the second proxy re encryption key RK without knowledge of the secret key SK. Further for an embodiment this includes the one or more curators obtaining a public key of the second party B and generating the second proxy re encryption key RK by applying a cryptographic function to the public key of the second party B.

For an embodiment the one or more curators maintain a first secret key SK and a second secret key SK . As described for one embodiment a single curator maintains the first secret key and the second secret key SK . For another embodiment a first curator maintains the first secret key and a second curator maintains the second secret key SK .

An embodiment further includes preventing collusion between the custodian and the second party B. Specifically the custodian and the second party cannot collude to recover the secret key of the group owner first party or first party A because the algorithm implements a one way pairing function that makes it computationally infeasible for the custodian and the second party to work backward and recover that secret the first party A s secret key nor any curator s secrete key.

For at least one embodiment the custodian includes an enterprise and the curator provides the trustworthy workflow within a cloud network. For an embodiment Party A is a resource provider in an enterprise and the curator is an identity provider.

An embodiment further includes one or more regulators receiving logs from at least one of the first party A and the second party B. An embodiment further includes one or more curators generating a third public key PK and a fourth public key PK publishing the third public key PK and the fourth public key PK and generating a third proxy re encryption key RK and a fourth proxy re encryption key RK . Further the first party A or the second party B encrypts log data having a key k1 wherein k1 is encrypted according to the third public key PK . One or more custodians proxy re encrypt k1 from the third public key PK to the fourth public key PK using the third proxy re encryption key RK wherein the proxy re encryption is one way and the one or more custodians proxy re encrypt k1 from the fourth public key PK to a public key PK of a regulator party R using the fourth proxy re encryption key RK . Finally the regulator party R receives the log data and decrypts with a secret key SK.

For at least some embodiments proxy re encryption keys are generated by the one or more curators have a time out period in which the proxy re encryption keys expire.

For at least some embodiments at least one of party A and party B are within a hierarchical group and further comprising proxy re encrypting the k more than twice wherein each translation of the data from one party of the hierarchical group to another party of the hierarchical group includes a proxy re encrypting.

Further the member and the mediator each publish their own public keys and maintain corresponding secret keys as a secret. The member and the mediator can each secure their secret key by protecting the secret key through encryption before storing or transmitting the secret key to a custodian. That key encryption key can be derived from a pass phrase that only the principal originator of the secret key knows.

Once the group has been formed the owner adds members such as member by generating a first share SKfrom the group secret key SKand a public key of a member and a second share SKfrom the group secret key SKand a public key of a mediator. The owner adds the member to the group by obtaining the member s public key from the mediator or some other public source .

Once the group has been formed and the owner has published the group public key PK a publisher can encrypt a document more generally electronic content using the group public key PK. For an embodiment the user retrieves the group public key PKfrom a custodian owner wherein the custodian is operating in the directory role. For an embodiment the document is encrypted according to a key K and the key K is encrypted according to the group public key PK. For an embodiment the document includes a payload and a header.

The member can obtain the encrypted document in various ways. The publisher may send the encrypted document to the member the member may retrieve the encrypted document or there may be an intermediary such as Drop Box between the publisher and the member .

The member receives the document but cannot directly decrypt the document because the member does not have access to the group secret key SK. However at least some embodiments allow the member to decrypt the document through the aid of the mediator . More specifically for an embodiment the member request mediation by the mediator by submitting the header of the document to the mediator . If the electronic content is small the header may actually be the payload of the electronic content. More typically the payload is large and the header only includes a cryptographic secret that can be used to unlock the payload.

In another embodiment a user server publishes the actual payload to a location that is resilient against inappropriate access or modification or because the payload is too voluminous for transmission in the data path and publishing a capability for gaining access in lieu of the payload and the member server consequently requiring mediation in order to access that capability for gaining access to the payload.

In certain situations where there is a pre defined data path such as document sharing through a solution such as Dropbox the encrypted document and the associated metadata is best packaged as a single unit that travels together. The original document that is encrypted is termed the payload and the header contains the cryptographic material and any associated document classifications and or access policies.

In other situations where the digital content is too unwieldy to share through a solution such as Dropbox either due to the size or to the streaming nature of access it may be better to replace the payload with an address. In this situation the header contains a capability that constitutes both a location that is otherwise difficult to guess along with the cryptographic material for an authorized party to perform cryptographic operations such as verification and decryption. In this case there might be other benefits such as tamper prevention since lack of access to that capability would typically preclude accidental or malicious defacement or deletion where defacement renders that original content inaccessible.

In other situations the payload itself might be very small perhaps representing an offer or a bid in a marketplace scenario or some other secret that needs to be securely stored or shared. In this case it might be optimal to embed this secret directly within the header. After a successful mediation operation the secret becomes directly accessible to the authorized recipient such as member without the subsequent need to unlock any payload.

Once the mediator receives the request for mediation from the member the mediator checks to confirm that the member is eligible for decryption of the document. The eligibility of the member can be determined in one or more ways.

One mechanism for determining member eligibility is for the mediator to maintain a white list or a black list of eligible members. Typically the owner or the delegate or auditor updates this list. In this case the member is eligible if they are on the white list or if they are not on the black list or both.

Another mechanism for determining member eligibility is for the mediator to maintain a matrix of authorization where one dimension of the matrix is the document classification while the other dimension is the access requirements. The first might be transferred securely and privately in some cases from the publisher to the mediator through the header. The second might specify individuals through a white or black list or it might specify specific roles that a requestor needs to be member of which is sometimes described as RBAC or Role Based Access Control. The second might also specify a claim that the member needs to provide to prove they have legitimate access to that document. This might be either an ancillary mechanism that is used in addition to group membership usually signs this claim or it might be in lieu of group membership where any member with the right claim will have access to that document . Some authority that the Mediator knows of can issue such a claim.

There are other mechanisms for the mediator to determine eligibility of a member which involve integration with existing enterprise and federation infrastructures. For example in a policy based network the mediator may serve as an enforcement point or Policy Enforcement Point that needs to check with one or more Policy Decision Points before it executes the mediation.

For an embodiment the mediator logs the requests by the member eligibility determinations and mediator responses. For an embodiment the logging includes the mediator storing the requests by the member eligibility determinations and mediator responses. Each of these can be logged at a server wherein the server is accessible by the owner and others. For an embodiment the logging includes the mediator dispatching alerts of the requests by the member eligibility determinations and mediator responses to the owner and others.

Due to the trustworthy nature of the hub it is an enabler of fine grain lifecycle management of electronic content perhaps in cases where it might be a business record and this facilitates the enforcement of retention disposition hold and other events of data that is owned by an individual or organization but is outside their region of control.

Based on the configuration the hub may either log access requests either ones that failed due to lack of eligibility or both . These logs may be made available to just the parties authorized by the group owner or their delegate or auditor. In other cases the logs may be delivered in the form of alerts to the group owner or their delegate or auditor in cases where there is a need for rapid notification.

If the mediator determines that the member is eligible the mediator responds to the request for mediation with a member accessible header wherein the member accessible header includes the header after application of SK.

Typically the logs and alerts from the hub are integrated with enterprise infrastructure that might range from Sys log d to specialized monitoring and discovery solutions or possibly to high scale log processing systems that might post process these logs for purposes that might include filtering classification pattern or anomaly detection. In many cases a cloud or similar network can provide an end to end service that would significantly reduce any individual or organization s capital and operational expenses.

For an embodiment the member obtains a secret based on SKand the member accessible header. Further the member decrypts the payload of the electronic content using the secret. Through the controlled document electronic content access of the described embodiments the member is able to decrypt the document only through the participation and control of the mediator and the owner .

As shown the mediator is at least partially controlled by a cloud connect service CCS the member and the publisher are at least partially controlled by a client connect agent CCA and the owner is at least partially controlled by a service connect agent SCA . The owner operates within a trusted zone and the mediator operates within a partially trusted zone.

In some embodiments the CCS centralizes roles that include Directory Key Store Mediator Log Storage and Delivery and others. In other embodiments a separate party that includes the owner operator or their organization or delegate hosts the Mediator.

It is to be understood that the roles of each of the parties owner member mediator publisher can be changed and or the parties can play multiple roles. That is for example the member can additionally play the role of owner. In some embodiments the group owner represents more than one individual whereby access to the group secret key itself is mediated in a similar operation.

Similar to the group formation previously described the owner also playing the role of member as previously described publishes a group public key PK and generating and maintaining a group secret key SKas a secret. The owner can store the group secret key SK for example in its own data center.

The subordinate member and a subordinate mediator each publish their own public keys and maintain corresponding secret keys as a secret. The subordinate member and the subordinate mediator can each secure their secret key by protecting the secret key through encryption before storing or transmitting the secret key to a custodian. That key encryption key can be derived from a pass phrase that only the principal originator of the secret key knows.

Once the group has been formed the owner adds members such as sub ordinate member by generating a first share SKfrom the group secret key SKand a public key of the sub ordinate member and a second share SKfrom the group secret key SKand a public key of a sub ordinate mediator . The owner adds the sub ordinate member to the group by obtaining the sub ordinate member s public from the sub ordinate mediator or some other public source .

Once the group has been formed and the owner has published the group public key PK the publisher note that this can be an entirely different publisher than previously described can encrypt a document more generally electronic content using the group public key PK. For an embodiment the sub ordinate user retrieves the group public key PKfrom the owner wherein the owner is operating in the directory role. For an embodiment the document is encrypted according to a key K and the key K is encrypted according to the group public key P. For an embodiment the document includes a payload and a header.

The subordinate member can obtain the encrypted document in various ways. The publisher may send the encrypted document to the subordinate member the subordinate member may retrieve the encrypted document or there may be an intermediary such as drop box between the publisher and the subordinate member .

The subordinate sub ordinate member receives the document but cannot directly decrypt the document because the sub ordinate member does not have access to the group secret key SK. However at least some embodiments allow the sub ordinate member to decrypt the document through the aid of the sub ordinate mediator . More specifically for an embodiment the sub ordinate member request mediation by the sub ordinate mediator by submitting the header of the document to the sub ordinate mediator . If the electronic content is small the header may actually be the payload of the electronic content. More typically the payload is large and the header only includes a cryptographic secret that can be used to unlock the payload.

Once the sub ordinate mediator receives the request for mediation from the sub ordinate member the sub ordinate mediator checks to confirm that the sub ordinate member is eligible for decryption of the document. The eligibility of the sub ordinate member can be determined in one more ways.

For an embodiment the sub ordinate mediator logs the requests by the member eligibility determinations and mediator responses. For an embodiment the logging includes the sub ordinate mediator storing the requests by the member eligibility determinations and mediator responses. Each of these can be logged at a server wherein the server is accessible by the owner and others. For an embodiment the logging includes the mediator dispatching alerts of the requests by the member eligibility determinations and mediator responses to the owner and others.

If the sub ordinate mediator determines that the sub ordinate member is eligible the sub ordinate mediator responds to the request for mediation with a member accessible header wherein the member accessible header includes the header after application of SK.

For an embodiment the sub ordinate member obtains a secret based on SKand the member accessible header. Further the sub ordinate member decrypts the payload of the electronic content using the secret. Through the controlled document electronic content access of the described embodiments the sub ordinate member is able to decrypt the document only through the participation and control of the mediator and the owner .

For at least some embodiments there are multiple mediators for either business reasons such as separation of responsibilities or for compliance reasons where certain categories of mediation are performed by a compliant entity or for federal or government reasons where some of the mediation is deemed to be more sensitive. In addition to partitioning of mediators in this manner it might be desired to have a level of redundancy and scale by duplicating the functionality of a mediator across multiple instances.

The publish can maintain some control by embedding for example an opaque watermark in the header and logging at for example a logging server by a mediator the header when received by the mediator from the member thereby allowing the publisher to track the electronic content. For at least some embodiments the watermark is selectively translucent to other parties perhaps log processing services that might be able to detect patterns and anomalies but in a manner that minimizes compromise of sensitive content. As shown in the header may include a key locator that is necessary for the intended recipient to obtain access to the sensitive payload. For at least some embodiments the received document is a composite of a header and a payload and the secret is the decryption key that is made available subsequent to mediation. In addition for at least some embodiments the secret might is augmented with a verification key for ensuring that the payload has not been tampered with in transit or storage. In cases where this payload is absent perhaps for reasons of efficiency or enhanced security the secret might also consist of a locator such as a Uniform Resource Identifier along with a decryption key. The intended recipient only knows of the real location of the payload that is a candidate for decryption after a successful mediation.

Another embodiment includes the publisher inserting an electronic content specific policy in the header as shown in as a policy for mediator wherein only the mediator can decrypt the policy and wherein the electronic content specific policy provides additional instructions regarding eligibility of the member. For an embodiment the policy directs the mediator to request mediation from a higher mediator authority. In at least some embodiments the policy is not visible to the members but is made available to the mediator . In other embodiments the policy that is visible to the mediator consists of subsequent instructions such as the need to consult with a policy decision point where those instructions to that policy decision point may not necessarily be visible to the mediator .

For an embodiment the header optionally contains visible information for intermediaries to perform cryptographic operations that might include checking for integrity of the encrypted payload or establishing non repudiation or data provenance. For an embodiment the member accessible header optionally contains information for performing cryptographic operations that might include checking for integrity of the encrypted or decrypted payload or establishing non repudiation or data provenance.

Typically in a scenario that involves collaboration or commerce there are diverse perhaps mutually distrustful participants that need to manage their own access policies that might include management of white or black lists and perhaps ratings of buyers sellers or other participants. These scenarios are federated and can consist of more than one owners might either have exclusive control over their respective sets of documents that they are the resource providers of or it may be the case that they may have to co operate through some policy to be able to update or modify the mediation policy.

The described embodiments enable the high scale enablement of existing networks such as International Trade where multiple mediators as described below might represent the banks that represent buyers and sellers and the eligibility for access to electronic goods or to the payment is gated by the need for a successful mediation by the appropriate mediator which is likely to have up to date information about the transaction in question.

There are other federation scenarios where the participants may not be willing or able to agree upon a single mediator. This might be for global commerce where the physical location of a mediator might make it subject to disruption or coercion by local powers. In such a situation at least some embodiment include more than one mediator that is isolated within distinct physical or electronic boundaries that limits physical or electronic access and the successful mediation requires all mediators to execute a mediation operation. It is possible to have more expressive circuits such as thresholds where perhaps a specified majority of mediators needs to execute their part in the mediation before the intended recipient gets access to the payload.

As previously described an embodiment includes the mediator logging requests by the member eligibility determinations and mediator responses. Specifically for an embodiment the logging includes the mediator storing the requests by the member eligibility determinations and mediator responses at a server wherein the server is accessible by the owner and others. For another embodiment the logging includes the mediator dispatching alerts of the requests by the member eligibility determinations and mediator responses to the owner and others.

As previously described for an embodiment determining whether the member is eligible includes the mediator being notified by the owner prior to the mediation request. For another embodiment determining whether the member is eligible comprises the mediator being notified by the owner or another authority prior to the mediation request that the member s public key in invalid.

As previously described for an embodiment if the payload is greater than a threshold in size the header includes a secret needed to decrypt the payload. If the payload is less than the threshold in size the header is the payload.

As previously described an embodiment further includes the member acting in an owner capacity and creating a subordinate group. For an embodiment this includes creating by the member a subordinate group comprising generating a subordinate group public key PKand a subordinate group secret key SK adding by the member a subordinate member to the subordinate group including generating a first share SKfrom the subordinate group secret key SKand a public key of a subordinate member and a second share SKfrom the subordinate group secret key SKand a public key of a subordinate mediator and providing the member the first share SKto a subordinate member server of the subordinate member and the second shares SKto a subordinate mediator server of the subordinate mediator.

As previously described an embodiment includes adding by the owner server a second member to the group comprising generating a first share SK2from the group secret key SKand a public key of the second member and a second share SK from the group secret key SKand the public key of the mediator and providing by the owner server the first share SK to a second member server of the second member and the second share SK to the mediator server of the mediator wherein the second share SKis different than the second share SK .

As previously described an embodiment further includes embedding by the publisher an opaque watermark in the header and logging by the mediator the header when received by the mediator from the member thereby allowing the publisher to track the electronic content.

As previously described an embodiment further includes inserting by the publisher an electronic content specific policy in the header wherein only the mediator can decrypt the policy and wherein the electronic content specific policy provides additional instructions regarding eligibility of the member. For an embodiment the policy directs the mediator to request mediation from a higher mediator authority.
