The present disclosure relates to the random generation of user passwords at customized intervals and sharing thereof to an additional user specifically the ability for a user to set customized intervals on a per password basis in a password manager for the generation of random passwords at the intervals and the automatic sharing of the random passwords to other users upon generation.

As people begin to use computing devices such as computers smart phones etc. more and more application programs and websites continue to be developed to offer people valuable services. As a common form of authentication many websites and applications require users to register and login with a password. With users registering and using a large number of websites and applications such as social networks e mail services merchants message boards games file sharing utilities etc. the number of passwords that a user has to remember can be overwhelming.

While some users may elect to use the same password across a variety of services many services have different requirements for a password that make this difficult if not impossible. In addition the use of a single password across multiple services can post a security risk as the user s password being compromised for one service could thereby compromise the user s account across a multitude of other services. As a result several password management services have become available whereby a user can register each one of his or her accounts with the password management service which can manage the user s passwords with the corresponding provider.

Password managers can sometimes provide the user with useful additional features such as the generating of random passwords for use with these services. The password manager can generate a random password and provide it to the corresponding service and can automatically log in the user such that the user does not need to know or remember the random password as long as the user can maintain access to the password manager. Some password managers may even offer the ability to generate and update passwords on a regular basis.

However in many cases password managers update passwords on a specific schedule set by the service itself or an administrator thereof. Because the user does not have access to the schedule for the automatic generating and updating of passwords such password managers may often not be suitable for the needs of a user. Furthermore such managers often change every one of a user s passwords when the schedule dictates which again may be detrimental to the needs and wants of a user. For example the user may have one account that is highly secure that needs the password changed at least once a day and another account that is in less danger of being compromised that the user does not want changed more than once a week for convenience.

Thus there is a need for a technical solution to provide a password management service to a user that can generate random passwords that fit criteria provided by the user that are randomly generated and updated at customized intervals set by the user on a per service basis.

The present disclosure provides a description of systems and methods for the sharing of randomly generated passwords and the generation thereof at customized intervals.

A method for randomly generating passwords at customized internals includes storing in a profile database of a computing device a plurality of user profiles wherein each user profile includes data related to a user including at least a user identifier a master password and a plurality of account data entries each account data entry including data related to a user account associated with the related user including at least a current password one or more password criteria and a predetermined period of time wherein the predetermined period of time is set by the related user identifying in the profile database of the computing device at least one user profile including one or more account data entries where the included predetermined period of time has expired generating by a processor of the computing device a new password for each of the one or more account data entries included in each of the identified at least one user profile using one or more random password generation algorithms wherein each generated new password is based on the one or more password criteria included in the respective account data entry and updating in the profile database of the computing device the current password included in each of the one or more account data entries included in each of the identified at least one user profile based on the generated new password.

A method for automatically sharing randomly generated passwords includes storing in a profile database of a computing device a plurality of user profiles wherein each user profile includes data related to a user including at least a user identifier a master password a first method of communication associated with the related user and a plurality of account data entries each account data entry including data related to a user account associated with the related user including at least a current password one or more password criteria and a sharing method of communication associated with a different user identifying in the profile database a specific user profile generating by a processor of the computing device a new password for at least one account data entry included in the specific user profile using one or more random password generation algorithms wherein each generated new password is based on the one or more password criteria included in the respective account data entry updating in the profile database of the computing device the current password included in each of the at least one account data entries included in the specific user profile based on the generated new password and transmitting by a transmitter of the computing device the generated new password based on the sharing method of the communication to the associated different user for each of the at least one account data entry included in the specific user profile.

The transmitting device is configured to transmit the generated new password based on the sharing method of the communication to the associated different user for each of the at least one account data entry included in the specific user profile.

Further areas of applicability of the present disclosure will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description of exemplary embodiments are intended for illustration purposes only and are therefore not intended to necessarily limit the scope of the disclosure.

The system may include a user . The user may possess a computing device that the user may use to access a variety of websites application programs and other services that may require authentication of the user via a password. The computing device may be any type of computing device suitable for performing the functions disclosed herein such as a desktop computer laptop computer notebook computer tablet computer cellular phone smart phone personal digital assistant smart watch etc.

Services to which the user is registered may be managed by one or more application servers . Each application server may store data associated with the user and their account such as a username and password associated with the user and used for authentication of the user . When the user executes a corresponding application program or visits a corresponding website the computing device may provide e.g. upon input by the user or from storage in the computing device the user s credentials e.g. username and password to the corresponding application server . The application server may check the credentials to authenticate the user and may proceed accordingly based on the authentication as will be apparent to persons having skill in the relevant art.

The computing device and application servers may communicate via one or more networks . The network may be any type of network suitable for performing the functions disclosed herein such as the Internet a mobile communication network a local area network a wireless area network a radio communication network etc.

As the number of websites and application programs the user may be registered with increases the number of passwords the user may be required to remember may become overwhelming. As a result the user may register with a password manager. The system may include a processing server . The processing server as discussed in more detail below may be configured to manage passwords for the user for a variety of accounts managed by the application servers . Basic functions provided by the processing server for managing passwords may include storage of account credentials the updating of account credentials at the request of the user communication of updated account credentials to the corresponding application server and more as will be apparent to persons having skill in the relevant art.

For additional security for the user s accounts the processing server may be further configured to randomly generate new passwords for websites or other services at customized intervals set by the user . As discussed in more detail below the user may set e.g. via the computing device communicating over the network a customized interval for the generation of a new password for each account or service managed by the processing server . For example the user may set for the generating and updating of a password every six hours for a first account once a day for a second account and once a week for a third account. By enabling the user to provide for customized intervals that are customized to each account or service the processing server may provide both additional security and additional convenience over traditional password managers.

As discussed in more detail below the processing server may store the customized intervals in a profile associated with the user . When the time corresponding to each interval has passed the processing server may generate a new random password based on one or more criteria e.g. provided by the user and or the corresponding application server such as password requirements set by the website or program update the user profile with the new password for the corresponding account and update the password with the corresponding application server . Methods suitable for the updating of passwords with an application server by an external processing server may include the use of an application programming interface or other methods that will be apparent to persons having skill in the relevant art.

In some embodiments the processing server may be configured to notify the user when a new password has been randomly generated and updated with the corresponding application server . For example the processing server may transmit a notification to the computing device for presentation to the user . The notification may be an e mail via a message in an application program or website e.g. used to manage the user account with the processing server a short message service SMS message a multimedia message service MMS message a telephone call or other suitable method of notification.

The processing server may also be configured to enable the user to provide for the sharing of a password with an additional user such as a sharing user . In such an instance the user may share an account with a website or service with the sharing user . For example the user and sharing user may be friends or acquaintances both of whom share a single account to a media streaming service or online merchant. As discussed in more detail below the user may provide the processing server with information regarding the sharing of newly generated passwords such as providing a method of communication to a sharing computing device . The sharing computing device may be a computing device associated with the sharing user such as a desktop computer laptop computer notebook computer tablet computer cellular phone smart phone personal digital assistant smart watch etc. In some embodiments the user may set a different sharing computing device for sharing of a password on a per password or per service basis. In some instances if the sharing user also uses the password management service provided by the processing server the user may select to share newly generated passwords with the sharing user via the password management service e.g. accessible by the sharing user via the sharing computing device while accessing their account with the processing server .

When the processing server generates a new password e.g. at the customized interval set by the user the processing server may also generate a transmit a message including the new password to the sharing computing device associated with the sharing user . The message including the new password may be transmitted by e mail via a message in an application program or website a short message service SMS message a multimedia message service MMS message a telephone call or other suitable method. In some instances the user may request a password be shared one time e.g. at the time of submitting the request or may request a password be shared automatically upon updating by the processing server . The sharing of passwords to a sharing user upon generation by the processing server may provide for added convenience to both the user and the sharing user over traditional password managers as the convenience in the traditional sharing of an account may be maintained while receiving the added benefits and security of a password manager particularly a password manager provided by the processing server discussed herein.

The processing server may also be configured to provide additional features to the user and or computing device for the management and use of randomly generated passwords. For example in one embodiment the processing server may enable the user to automatically login to a website or application program with a newly generated password. In such an embodiment an application program or website operated by the processing server e.g. and accessed via the computing device may include a hyperlink to a website or application program that when selected by the user automatically logs the user in to the linked website or application program with stored credentials.

In another embodiment the processing server may be configured to enable the user to view randomly generated passwords. For example an application program or website operated by the processing server may include an option for the user to view a current password for each account registered with the processing server . In some embodiments the user may be able to set criteria for use in the generating of random passwords for updating by the processing server . For example the user may set a minimum or maximum number of characters to be included in a password a minimum number of different types of characters e.g. letters numbers symbols rules regarding the use of uppercase or lowercase characters etc.

In some embodiments accounts registered with the processing server by the user may use multiple methods of communication to manage the account. For example the user may be required to register and login with the processing server using a master password or other similar credential as well as an additional credential such as a one time password or value provided by a security token. For instance the user may have a second computing device such as a smart phone that has an application program stored therein that is configured to provide a one time password. In such an instance the user may provide their master password for their account via the computing device as well as the one time password provided by the application program on the smart phone. The processing server may then authenticate the user using both items. Methods for authentication of a user using multiple points of authentication and the use of security tokens one time passwords or other suitable types of authentication will be apparent to persons having skill in the relevant art.

In one embodiment the processing server may be configured to automatically login the user in one or more computing devices once a new password has been generated. For example the processing server may update a password for a user account with a website and then may instruct the computing device to login to the website or otherwise update stored data e.g. in a browsing application program website cookie etc. regarding the password to be used to login to the corresponding website. In such an instance the user may continue to browse the website without their experience being interrupted by the updating of the password.

In another embodiment the processing server may be configured to automatically update the password stored in one or more application programs in one or more computing devices based on a newly generated and updated password. For example the user may have multiple computing devices each of which may include an application program for a social network. The application program may store login credentials locally on the corresponding computing device such that the user may load the application program and be logged in to their account without having to enter credentials each time. In such an instance the processing server may instruct each computing device to update the locally stored login credentials with the updated password such that the user experience is not interrupted.

The processing server may include a communication interface . The communication interface may be configured to transmit and receive data over one or more networks via one or more network protocols.

When the user registers with the processing server the processor may be configured to store registration data and other data associated with the user in a profile database . The user data may be stored in a user profile associated with the user and included in the profile database .

Each user profile may include data associated with a user and include a user identifier master password contact information and one or more account data entries . The user identifier may be a unique value suitable for identification of the user and or their corresponding user profile such as an identification number username e mail address phone number etc. In some embodiments each user profile may include multiple user identifiers such as both a user identification number and a username.

The master password may be a password provided by the user for management of their account with the processing server . The contact information may include information for use by the processing server in contacting the user such as a preferred method of contact e.g. e mail SMS message MMS message website etc. identifier for use in the preferred method of contact e.g. e mail address telephone number device identifier internet protocol address media access control address etc. etc. In some embodiments the contact information e.g. or the user profile as a whole may include data regarding the computing device associated with the user or another computing device used by the user for authentication of the user such as a computing device on which a security token application program is installed or an identifier of the security token application program.

Each of the one or more account data entries may include data related to a website application program or service account associated with the user and managed by the processing server . Each account data entry may include at least a current password one or more password criteria a custom interval and if applicable sharing information . Each account data entry may also include additional credentials associated with the corresponding service e.g. username e mail address etc. information regarding automatic login of the corresponding account e.g. addresses or other data regarding application programs and websites on one or more computing devices to be updated with a new password or other additional data as will be apparent to persons having skill in the relevant art.

The current password may be the password that is currently used for login to the associated account or service. The one or more password criteria may be criteria provided by the user and or the corresponding service for the generation of a new random password to be used to update the current password on the account. For example the one or more password criteria may include a minimum or maximum number of characters to be included in a password a minimum number of different types of characters e.g. letters numbers symbols rules regarding the use of uppercase or lowercase characters etc.

The custom interval may be a predetermined period of time set by the user related to the corresponding user profile for the updating of the current password in the account related to the respective account data entry . The predetermined period of time may be any period of time suitable for performing the functions disclosed herein such as 5 minutes 30 minutes 1 hour 2 hours 6 hours 12 hours 24 hours 2 days 1 week 1 month 6 months 1 year never etc. The custom interval may be specific to the respective account data entry such that the user may set an individual custom interval for each account data entry . For example the user may set one or more accounts to update once an hour and may set other accounts to update once a day.

The sharing information may include contact information regarding the sharing of the current password for the account data entry once the password is updated e.g. based on the custom interval . The sharing information may include a method of contact for the sharing user and contact information regarding sharing the current password via the method of contact. For example a newly generated password may be transmitted to a specific sharing computing device e.g. via an internet protocol address media access control address telephone number e mail address device identifier etc. via a specified method such as e mail telephone SMS message MMS message etc.

As discussed in more detail below the processor may be configured to generate random passwords for each account data entry based on the included one or more password criteria . In some embodiments the processor may generate a random password for an account data entry and update the current password included in the account data entry if the predetermined period of time set in the included custom interval has expired. In such an embodiment the processor may be configured to monitor the custom interval for each account data entry in each user profile and generate a new password and update the current password accordingly. In some instances each account data entry may include a time when the current password was set e.g. for comparison with the custom interval . In other instances the custom interval may be a countdown to when a new password needs to be generated or may be a time at which the processor is to generate a new password.

When a new password is generated and the current password in the corresponding account data entry updated the processor may be configured to generate and or execute instructions for updating the account with the corresponding application server based on the updated password. The communication interface may transmit any corresponding data and or instructions to the respective application server over the network . In some embodiments the processor may also generate data and or instructions for transmitting to one or more computing devices associated with the respective user profile by the communication interface for updating of the password data stored therein as discussed herein.

The processor may also be configured to generate a notification based on an updated password. The notification may be for transmitting to the computing device associated with the user related to a respective user profile e.g. based on the included contact information and or for transmitting to the sharing computing device associated with the sharing user e.g. based on the sharing information in the respective account data entry . In some instances the notification may include the newly generated password. The notification may be transmitted via the communication interface over the network to the corresponding destination.

The processing server may also include a memory . The memory may be configured to store data suitable for performing the functions disclosed herein. In some embodiments the processing server may also include a display interface .

The input interface may be configured to interface the processing server with one or more input devices such as to receive data input by one or more users of the processing server . Additional or alternative components that may be included in the processing server or additional functions provided by the components illustrated in the processing server and discussed herein e.g. for the traditional features of a password management service will be apparent to persons having skill in the relevant art.

In step the processor of the processing server may store user profile data as a user profile in the profile database of the processing server . In step the processor may wait and monitor for the next action to occur. Once an action has occurred e.g. been detected by the processor or other component of the processing server the process may continue and the processor may determine the action that has occurred.

In step the processor may determine if the user profile has been updated. The determination may be based on for example if data has been received by the communication interface over the network from a computing device . If the user profile has been updated by the user then in step the communication interface may receive the data from the computing device and forward the received update data to the processor . The update data may include at least a user identifier associated with the user and the data for updating in the user profile .

In step the processor may update the user profile based on the received update data. Updating the user profile may include identifying the user profile in the profile database that includes a user identifier corresponding to the identifier received from the computing device and updating the corresponding data. Updating the corresponding data may include updating the contact information updating the master password associating a new computing device with the user profile adding a new account data entry corresponding with a new service being registered with the user profile updating a custom interval sharing information or criteria in a specified account data entry etc. Once the user profile has been updated the process may return to step where the processor may wait for additional actions.

If an action has occurred that is not the updating of a user profile then in step the processor may determine if a custom interval in one or more account data entries of one or more user profiles has expired. The expiration of a custom interval may be identified by a custom interval counting down to zero a current time and or date exceeding a time and or date set in the custom interval a predetermined period of time in a custom interval having passed since a timestamp for a previous password change or other suitable method. If no custom interval has expired then the process may return to step and the processing server may await a new action.

If a custom interval has expired then in step the processor may generate a random password for each account data entry in each user profile where the included custom interval has expired. The random password generated for each account data entry may be based on the criteria included in the respective account data entry . In step the processor may update the respective account data entry by updating the current password with the newly generated random password. In some embodiments the account data entry may continue to store the old password such as in instances where the old password may be used to update the password with the application server . In some instances the old password may be stored in the memory of the processing server .

In step the communication interface of the processing server may transmit the newly generated password to the corresponding application server for updating of the password in the associated account. In some embodiments the communication interface may also transmit any other data necessary for use in updating the password such as other user credentials e.g. username e mail address etc. the previous password etc. Methods and systems for providing a new password to an application server for updating thereof will be apparent to persons having skill in the relevant art.

In step the processor may determine if the newly generated password is to be shared with one or more sharing users . The determination may be based on data included in the respective account data entry such as the sharing information . If the new password is not to be shared then the process may return to step where the processing server may await a new action. If the password is to be shared then in step the communication interface may transmit a notification including the newly generated password to one or more sharing computing devices based on the sharing information included in the account data entry . Once sharing is completed the process may return to step and the processing server may await a new action.

In one embodiment each user profile may further include contact information e.g. contact information and the method may further include identifying by the processor of the computing device a specific user profile of the identified at least one user profile and transmitting by a transmitter e.g. the communication interface of the computing device at least an indication of the generated new password for each of the one or more account data entries included in the specific user profile where the included predetermined period of time has expired to the user related to the specific user profile based on the contact information included ni the specific user profile .

In some embodiments the method may also include transmitting by the transmitter of the computing device the generated new password for each of the one or more account data entries included in each of the identified at least one user profile to an application server e.g. the application server associated with the respective related user account. In one embodiment the method may further include receiving by a receiver e.g. the communication interface of the computing device a password interval update request originating from a specific user wherein the password interval update request includes at least a specific user identifier associated with the specific user and an updated period of time identifying in the profile database of the computing device a specific user profile where the included user identifier corresponds to the specific user identifier and updating in the specific user profile the predetermined period of time based on the updated period of time.

In step a plurality of user profiles e.g. user profiles may be stored in a profile database e.g. the profile database of a computing device e.g. the processing server wherein each user profile includes data related to a user e.g. the user including at least a user identifier e.g. the user identifier a master password e.g. the master password a first method of communication e.g. contact information associated with the related user and a plurality of account data entries e.g. account data entries each account data entry including data related to a user account associated with the related user including at least a current password e.g. current password one or more password criteria e.g. criteria and a sharing method of communication e.g. the sharing information associated with a different user e.g. the sharing user . In one embodiment the sharing method of communication includes at least one of electronic mail short message service message multimedia message service message and telephone.

In step a specific user profile may be identified in the profile database . In step a new password may be generated by a processor e.g. the processor of the computing device for at least one account data entry included in the specific user profile using one or more random password generation algorithms wherein each generated new password is based on the one or more password criteria included in the respective account data entry . In step the current password included in each of the at least one account data entries included in the specific user profile may be updated in the profile database of the computing device based on the generated new password.

In step the generated new password may be transmitted by a transmitter e.g. the communication interface of the computing device based on the sharing method of communication to the associated different user for each of the at least one account data entry included in the specific user profile . In some embodiments the method may further include transmitting by the transmitter of the computing device the generated new password based on the first method of communication to the related user for each of the at least one account data entry included in the specific user profile .

In one embodiment each account data entry may further include a predetermined period of time e.g. the custom interval and the method may further include identifying by the processor of the computing device that the predetermined period of time included in each of the at least one account data entry in the specific user profile has expired. In a further embodiment the predetermined period of time is set by the related user .
