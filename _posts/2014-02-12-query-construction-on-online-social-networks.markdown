title: Query construction on online social networks
abstract: In one embodiment, a method includes accessing a set of nodes of a social graph of an online social network. The social graph includes a number of nodes and a number of edges connecting the nodes. Each of the edges between two of the nodes representing a single degree of separation between them. The nodes include a first node that corresponds to the first user and a number of nodes that each correspond to a concept or a second user associated with the online social network. The method also includes accessing one or more grammar tokens. Each grammar token includes references to zero or more nodes and one or more edges. Each grammar token corresponds to a particular type of completion token. Each grammar token may be based on a natural-language string. The method also includes receiving from the first user a selection of one or more of the grammar tokens and one or more of the completion tokens.

This disclosure generally relates to social graphs and performing searches for objects within a social networking environment.

A social networking system which may include a social networking website may enable its users such as persons or organizations to interact with it and with each other through it. The social networking system may with input from a user create and store in the social networking system a user profile associated with the user. The user profile may include demographic information communication channel information and information on personal interests of the user. The social networking system may also with input from a user create and store a record of relationships of the user with other users of the social networking system as well as provide services e.g. wall posts photo sharing event organization messaging games or advertisements to facilitate social interaction between or among users.

The social networking system may transmit over one or more networks content or messages related to its services to a mobile or other computing device of a user. A user may also install software applications on a mobile or other computing device of the user for accessing a user profile of the user and other data within the social networking system. The social networking system may generate a personalized set of content objects to display to a user such as a newsfeed of aggregated stories of other users connected to the user.

Social graph analysis views social relationships in terms of network theory consisting of nodes and edges. Nodes represent the individual actors within the networks and edges represent the relationships between the actors. The resulting graph based structures are often very complex. There can be many types of nodes and many types of edges for connecting nodes. In its simplest form a social graph is a map of all of the relevant edges between all the nodes being studied.

In particular embodiments a system may generate a search query using a multi step implementation and a graphical interface to a natural language search query interface. A complete search query may be divided into different tokens such as for example a grammar token and a completion token. The system may select a particular grammar token from a list of pre determined grammar tokens. The pre determined grammar tokens may correspond to nodes and edges of a social graph and the selection of the grammar token may lock in the grammar token into the search query. The list of pre determined grammar tokens may be based on text inputted into a query field by the user. For example the user typing ph in a query field may be provided grammar tokens Photos of Photos by or Photos from. In response to the user selecting a particular grammar token the system may display one or more completion tokens. The completion tokens may correspond to a social graph object associated with the querying user such as for example photos or profile pages of friends of the user. The list of completion tokens presented to the user may be based on the selected grammar token and possibly based on one or more additional factors such as for example the affinity of the social graph objects associated with the grammar token. In addition completion tokens with low relevance to the selected grammar token may be filtered out. The user may select a particular completion token to complete the search query and initiate the search by the server. Additional grammar tokens or completion tokens may be appended to the search query for example by selecting the query field.

In particular embodiments a user node may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with a user. In particular embodiments a user node may correspond to one or more webpages.

In particular embodiments a concept node may correspond to a concept. As an example and not by way of limitation a concept may correspond to a place such as for example a movie theater restaurant landmark or city a website such as for example a website associated with social networking system or a third party website associated with a web application server an entity such as for example a person business group sports team or celebrity a resource such as for example an audio file video file digital photo text file structured document or application which may be located within social networking system or on an external server such as a web application server real or intellectual property such as for example a sculpture painting movie game song idea photograph or written work a game an activity an idea or theory another suitable concept or two or more such concepts. A concept node may be associated with information of a concept provided by a user or information gathered by various systems including social networking system . As an example and not by way of limitation information of a concept may include a name or a title one or more images e.g. an image of the cover page of a book a location e.g. an address or a geographical location a website which may be associated with a URL contact information e.g. a phone number or an email address other suitable concept information or any suitable combination of such information. In particular embodiments a concept node may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with concept node . In particular embodiments a concept node may correspond to one or more webpages.

In particular embodiments a node in social graph may represent or be represented by a webpage which may be referred to as a profile page . Profile pages may be hosted by or accessible to social networking system . Profile pages may also be hosted on third party websites associated with a third party server . As an example and not by way of limitation a profile page corresponding to a particular external webpage may be the particular external webpage and the profile page may correspond to a particular concept node . Profile pages may be viewable by all or a selected subset of other users. As an example and not by way of limitation a user node may have a corresponding user profile page in which the corresponding user may add content make declarations or otherwise express himself or herself. As another example and not by way of limitation a concept node may have a corresponding concept profile page in which one or more users may add content make declarations or express themselves particularly in relation to the concept corresponding to concept node .

In particular embodiments a concept node may represent a third party webpage or resource hosted by a third party system . The third party webpage or resource may include among other elements content a selectable or other icon or other inter actable object which may be implemented for example in JavaScript AJAX or PHP codes representing an action or activity. As an example and not by way of limitation a third party webpage may include a selectable icon such as like check in eat recommend or another suitable action or activity. A user viewing the third party webpage may perform an action by selecting one of the icons e.g. eat causing a client system to transmit to social networking system a message indicating the user s action. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge e.g. an eat edge between a user node corresponding to the user and a concept node corresponding to the third party webpage or resource and store edge in one or more data stores.

In particular embodiments a pair of nodes in social graph may be connected to each other by one or more edges . An edge connecting a pair of nodes may represent a relationship between the pair of nodes. In particular embodiments an edge may include or represent one or more data objects or attributes corresponding to the relationship between a pair of nodes. As an example and not by way of limitation a first user may indicate that a second user is a friend of the first user. In response to this indication social networking system may transmit a friend request to the second user. If the second user confirms the friend request social networking system may create an edge connecting the first user s user node to the second user s user node in social graph and store edge as social graph information in one or more of data stores . In the example of social graph includes an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user A and user B and an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user C and user B. Although this disclosure describes or illustrates particular edges with particular attributes connecting particular user nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes . As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent a friendship family relationship business or employment relationship fan relationship follower relationship visitor relationship subscriber relationship superior subordinate relationship reciprocal relationship non reciprocal relationship another suitable type of relationship or two or more such relationships. Moreover although this disclosure generally describes nodes as being connected this disclosure also describes users or concepts as being connected. Herein references to users or concepts being connected may where appropriate refer to the nodes corresponding to those users or concepts being connected in social graph by one or more edges .

In particular embodiments an edge between a user node and a concept node may represent a particular action or activity performed by a user associated with user node toward a concept associated with a concept node . As an example and not by way of limitation as illustrated in a user may like attended played listened cooked worked at or watched a concept each of which may correspond to a edge type or subtype. A concept profile page corresponding to a concept node may include for example a selectable check in icon such as for example a clickable check in icon or a selectable add to favorites icon. Similarly after a user clicks these icons social networking system may create a favorite edge or a check in edge in response to a user s action corresponding to a respective action. As another example and not by way of limitation a user user C may listen to a particular song Imagine using a particular application SPOTIFY which is an online music application . In this case social networking system may create a listened edge and a used edge as illustrated in between user nodes corresponding to the user and concept nodes corresponding to the song and application to indicate that the user listened to the song and used the application. Moreover social networking system may create a played edge as illustrated in between concept nodes corresponding to the song and the application to indicate that the particular song was played by the particular application. In this case played edge corresponds to an action performed by an external application SPOTIFY on an external audio file the song Imagine . Although this disclosure describes particular edges with particular attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes . Moreover although this disclosure describes edges between a user node and a concept node representing a single relationship this disclosure contemplates edges between a user node and a concept node representing one or more relationships. As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent both that a user likes and has used at a particular concept. Alternatively another edge may represent each type of relationship or multiples of a single relationship between a user node and a concept node as illustrated in between user node for user E and concept node for SPOTIFY .

In particular embodiments social networking system may create an edge between a user node and a concept node in social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation a user viewing a concept profile page such as for example by using a web browser or a special purpose application hosted by the user s client system may indicate that he or she likes the concept represented by the concept node by clicking or selecting a Like icon which may cause the user s client system to transmit to social networking system a message indicating the user s liking of the concept associated with the concept profile page. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge between user node associated with the user and concept node as illustrated by like edge between the user and concept node . In particular embodiments social networking system may store an edge in one or more data stores. In particular embodiments an edge may be automatically formed by social networking system in response to a particular user action. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user uploads a picture watches a movie or listens to a song an edge may be formed between user node corresponding to the first user and concept nodes corresponding to those concepts. Although this disclosure describes forming particular edges in particular manners this disclosure contemplates forming any suitable edges in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments one or more client side and or backend server side processes may implement and utilize a typeahead feature that may automatically attempt to match social graph elements e.g. user nodes concept nodes or edges to information currently being entered by a user in an input form rendered in conjunction with a requested webpage such as for example a user profile page a concept profile page a search results webpage or another suitable page of the online social network which may be hosted by or accessible in the social networking system . In particular embodiments as a user is entering text to make a declaration the typeahead feature may attempt to match the string of textual characters being entered in the declaration to strings of characters e.g. names descriptions corresponding to user concepts or edges and their corresponding elements in the social graph . In particular embodiments when a match is found the typeahead feature may automatically populate the form with a reference to the social graph element such as for example the node name type node ID edge name type edge ID or another suitable reference or identifier of the existing social graph element. The typeahead functionality described herein can also be used to match inputs to social graph elements when generating grammar tokens and or completion tokens as described below.

In particular embodiments as a user types or otherwise enters text into a form used to add content or make declarations in various sections of the user s profile page home page or other page the typeahead process may work in conjunction with one or more frontend client side and or backend server side typeahead processes hereinafter referred to simply as typeahead process executing at or within the social networking system e.g. within servers to interactively and virtually instantaneously as appearing to the user attempt to auto populate the form with a term or terms corresponding to names of existing social graph elements or terms associated with existing social graph elements determined to be the most relevant or best match to the characters of text entered by the user as the user enters the characters of text. Utilizing the social graph information in a social graph database or information extracted and indexed from the social graph database including information associated with nodes and edges the typeahead processes in conjunction with the information from the social graph database as well as potentially in conjunction with various others processes applications or databases located within or executing within social networking system may be able to predict a user s intended declaration with a high degree of precision. However the social networking system can also provide users with the freedom to enter essentially any declaration they wish enabling users to express themselves freely.

In particular embodiments as a user enters text characters into a form box or other field the typeahead processes may attempt to identify existing social graph elements e.g. user nodes concept nodes or edges that match the string of characters entered in the user s declaration as the user is entering the characters. In particular embodiments as the user enters characters into a form box the typeahead process may read the string of entered textual characters. As each keystroke is made the frontend typeahead process may transmit the entered character string as a request or call to the backend typeahead process executing within social networking system . In particular embodiments the typeahead processes may communicate via AJAX Asynchronous JavaScript and XML or other suitable techniques and particularly asynchronous techniques. In particular embodiments the request may be or comprise an XMLHTTPRequest XHR enabling quick and dynamic sending and fetching of results. In particular embodiments the typeahead process may also transmit before after or with the request a section identifier section ID that identifies the particular section of the particular page in which the user is making the declaration. In particular embodiments a user ID parameter may also be sent but this may be unnecessary in some embodiments as the user may already be known based on the user having logged into or otherwise been authenticated by the social networking system .

In particular embodiments the typeahead process may use one or more matching algorithms to attempt to identify matching social graph elements. In particular embodiments when a match or matches are found the typeahead process may transmit a response which may utilize AJAX or other suitable techniques to the user s client system that may include for example the names name strings or descriptions of the matching social graph elements as well as potentially other metadata associated with the matching social graph elements. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user entering the characters pok into a query field the typeahead process may display a drop down menu that displays names of matching existing profile pages and respective user nodes or concept nodes such as a profile page named or devoted to poker or pokemon which the user can then click on or otherwise select thereby confirming the desire to declare the matched user or concept name corresponding to the selected node. As another example and not by way of limitation upon clicking poker the typeahead process may auto populate or causes the web browser to auto populate the query field with the declaration poker . In particular embodiments the typeahead process may simply auto populate the field with the name or other identifier of the top ranked match rather than display a drop down menu. The user may then confirm the auto populated declaration simply by keying enter on his or her keyboard or by clicking on the auto populated declaration.

More information on typeahead processes may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 763 162 filed 19 Apr. 2010 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 556 072 filed 23 Jul. 2012 which are incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments the typeahead processes described herein may be applied to search queries entered by a user. As an example and not by way of limitation as a user enters text characters into a search field a typeahead process may attempt to identify one or more user nodes concept nodes or edges that match the string of characters entered search field as the user is entering the characters. As the typeahead process receives requests or calls including a string or n gram from the text query the typeahead process may perform or causes to be performed a search to identify existing social graph elements i.e. user nodes concept nodes edges having respective names types categories or other identifiers matching the entered text. The typeahead process may use one or more matching algorithms to attempt to identify matching nodes or edges. When a match or matches are found the typeahead process may transmit a response to the user s client system that may include for example the names name strings of the matching nodes as well as potentially other metadata associated with the matching nodes. The typeahead process may then display a drop down menu that displays names of matching existing profile pages and respective user nodes or concept nodes and displays names of matching edges that may connect to the matching user nodes or concept nodes which the user can then click on or otherwise select thereby confirming the desire to search for the matched user or concept name corresponding to the selected node or to search for users or concepts connected to the matched users or concepts by the matching edges. Alternatively the typeahead process may simply auto populate the form with the name or other identifier of the top ranked match rather than display a drop down menu . The user may then confirm the auto populated declaration simply by keying enter on a keyboard or by clicking on the auto populated declaration. Upon user confirmation of the matching nodes and edges the typeahead process may transmit a request that informs the social networking system of the user s confirmation of a query containing the matching social graph elements. In response to the request transmitted the social networking system may automatically or alternately based on an instruction in the request call or otherwise search a social graph database for the matching social graph elements or for social graph elements connected to the matching social graph elements as appropriate. Although this disclosure describes applying the typeahead processes to search queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates applying the typeahead processes to search queries in any suitable manner.

In connection with search queries and search results particular embodiments may utilize one or more systems components elements functions methods operations or steps disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 503 093 filed 11 Aug. 2006 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 977 027 filed 22 Dec. 2010 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 978 265 filed 23 Dec. 2010 which are incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments in response to a text query received from a first user i.e. the querying user the social networking system may generate one or more structured queries rendered in a natural language syntax where each structured query includes query tokens that correspond to one or more identified social graph elements. By providing suggested structured queries in response to a user s text query the social networking system may provide a powerful way for users of the online social network to search for elements represented in the social graph based on their social graph attributes and their relation to various social graph elements. Structured queries may allow a querying user to search for content that is connected to particular users or concepts in the social graph by particular edge types. As an example and not by way of limitation the social networking system may receive an unstructured text query from a first user. In response the social networking system via for example a server side element detection process may access the social graph and then parse the text query to identify social graph elements that corresponded to n grams from the text query. The social networking system may then access a grammar model such as a context free grammar model which includes a plurality of grammars. These grammars may be visualized as a grammar forest that is organized as an ordered tree with a plurality of non terminal and terminal tokens. The identified social graph elements may be used as terminal tokens query tokens in the grammars. Once these terminal tokens have been identified for example by using a semantic tree that corresponds to the text query from the user the social networking system may traverse the grammar forest to identify intersecting non terminal nodes. Each grammar represented by one of these intersecting non terminal nodes may then be selected. The selected grammars may then be used to generate one or more structured queries that include the query tokens referencing the identified social graph elements. These structured queries may be based on strings generated by the grammars such that they are rendered with references to the appropriate social graph elements using a natural language syntax. The structured queries may be transmitted to the first user and displayed in a drop down menu via for example a client side typeahead process where the first user can then select an appropriate query to search for the desired content. Some of the advantages of using the structured queries described herein include finding users of the online social network based upon limited information bringing together virtual indexes of content from the online social network based on the relation of that content to various social graph elements or finding content related to you and or your friends. By using this process the output of the natural language rendering process may be efficiently parsed for example to generate modified or alternative structured queries. Furthermore since the rules used by this process are derived from the grammar model any modification to the rules of the grammar model can be immediately reflected in the rendering process. Although this disclosure describes generating particular structured queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating any suitable structured queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may receive from a querying first user corresponding to a first user node an unstructured text query. As an example and not by way of limitation a first user may want to search for other users who 1 are first degree friends of the first user and 2 are associated with Stanford University i.e. the user nodes are connected by an edge to the concept node corresponding to the school Stanford . The first user may then enter a text query friends stanford into query field . As the first user enters this text query into query field the social networking system may provide various suggested structured queries as illustrated in drop down menus . As used herein an unstructured text query refers to a simple text string inputted by a user. The text query may of course be structured with respect to standard language grammar rules e.g. English language grammar . However the text query will ordinarily be unstructured with respect to social graph elements. In other words a simple text query will not ordinarily include embedded references to particular social graph elements. Thus as used herein a structured query refers to a query that contains references to particular social graph elements allowing the search engine to search based on the identified elements. Furthermore the text query may be unstructured with respect to formal query syntax. In other words a simple text query will not necessarily be in the format of a query command that is directly executable by a search engine. Although this disclosure describes receiving particular queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates receiving any suitable queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may parse the unstructured text query also simply referred to as a search query received from the first user i.e. the querying user to identify one or more n grams. In general an n gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sequence of text or speech. The items may be characters phonemes syllables letters words base pairs prefixes or other identifiable items from the sequence of text or speech. The n gram may comprise one or more characters of text letters numbers punctuation etc. entered by the querying user. An n gram of size one can be referred to as a unigram of size two can be referred to as a bigram or digram of size three can be referred to as a trigram and so on. Each n gram may include one or more parts from the text query received from the querying user. In particular embodiments each n gram may comprise a character string e.g. one or more characters of text entered by the first user. As an example and not by way of limitation the social networking system may parse the text query friends stanford to identify the following n grams friends stanford friends stanford. As another example and not by way of limitation the social networking system may parse the text query friends in palo alto to identify the following n grams friends in palo alto friends in in palo palo alto friend in palo in palo alto friends in palo alto. In particular embodiments each n gram may comprise a contiguous sequence of n items from the text query. Although this disclosure describes parsing particular queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates parsing any suitable queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may determine or calculate for each n gram identified in the text query a score that the n gram corresponds to a social graph element. The score may be for example a confidence score a probability a quality a ranking another suitable type of score or any combination thereof. As an example and not by way of limitation the social networking system may determine a probability score also referred to simply as a probability that the n gram corresponds to a social graph element such as a user node a concept node or an edge of social graph . The probability score may indicate the level of similarity or relevance between the n gram and a particular social graph element. There may be many different ways to calculate the probability. The present disclosure contemplates any suitable method to calculate a probability score for an n gram identified in a search query. In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine a probability p that an n gram corresponds to a particular social graph element. The probability p may be calculated as the probability of corresponding to a particular social graph element k given a particular search query X. In other words the probability may be calculated as p k X . As an example and not by way of limitation a probability that an n gram corresponds to a social graph element may calculated as an probability score denoted as p. The input may be a text query X x x . . . x and a set of classes. For each i j and a class k the social networking system may compute p p class x k X . As an example and not by way of limitation the n gram stanford could be scored with respect to the following social graph elements as follows school Stanford University 0.7 location Stanford Calif. 0.2 user Allen Stanford 0.1. As another example and not by way of limitation the n gram friends could be scored with respect to the following social graph elements as follows user friends 0.9 television show Friends 0.1. In particular embodiments the social networking system may user a forward backward algorithm to determine the probability that a particular n gram corresponds to a particular social graph element. For a given n gram within a text query the social networking system may use both the preceding and succeeding n grams to determine which particular social graph elements correspond to the given n gram. In particular embodiments the identified social graph elements may be used to generate a query command that is executable by a search engine. The query command may be a structured semantic query with defined functions that accept specific arguments. As an example and not by way of limitation the text query friend me mark could be parsed to form the query command intersect friend me friend Mark . In other words the query is looking for nodes in the social graph that intersect the querying user me and the user Mark i.e. those user nodes that are connected to both the user node of the querying user by a friend type edge and the user node for the user Mark by a friend type edge . Although this disclosure describes determining whether n grams correspond to social graph elements in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates determining whether n grams correspond to social graph elements in any suitable manner. Moreover although this disclosure describes determining whether an n gram corresponds to a social graph element using a particular type of score this disclosure contemplates determining whether an n gram corresponds to a social graph element using any suitable type of score.

In particular embodiments social networking system may identify one or more edges having a probability greater than an edge threshold probability. Each of the identified edges may correspond to at least one of the n grams. As an example and not by way of limitation the n gram may only be identified as corresponding to an edge k if p p. Furthermore each of the identified edges may be connected to at least one of the identified nodes. In other words the social networking system may only identify edges or edge types that are connected to user nodes or concept nodes that have previously been identified as corresponding to a particular n gram. Edges or edge types that are not connected to any previously identified node are typically unlikely to correspond to a particular n gram in a search query. By filtering out or ignoring these edges and edge types the social networking system may more efficiently search the social graph for relevant social graph elements. As an example and not by way of limitation referencing for a text query containing went to Stanford where an identified concept node is the school Stanford the social networking system may identify the edges corresponding to worked at and the edges corresponding to attended both of which are connected to the concept node for Stanford. Thus the n gram went to may be identified as corresponding to these edges . However for the same text query the social networking system may not identify the edges corresponding to like or fan in the social graph because the Stanford node does not have any such edges connected to it. Although this disclosure describes identifying edges that correspond to n grams in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates identifying edges that correspond to n grams in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may identify one or more user nodes or concept nodes having a probability greater than a node threshold probability. Each of the identified nodes may correspond to at least one of the n grams. As an example and not by way of limitation the n gram may only be identified as corresponding to a node k if p p. Furthermore each of the identified user nodes or concept nodes may be connected to at least one of the identified edges . In other words the social networking system may only identify nodes or nodes types that are connected to edges that have previously been identified as corresponding to a particular n gram. Nodes or node types that are not connected to any previously identified edges are typically unlikely to correspond to a particular n gram in a search query. By filtering out or ignoring these nodes and node types the social networking system may more efficiently search the social graph for relevant social graph elements. As an example and not by way of limitation for a text query containing worked at Apple where an identified edge is worked at the social networking system may identify the concept node corresponding to the company APPLE INC. which may have multiple edges of worked at connected to it. However for the same text query the social networking system may not identify the concept node corresponding to the fruit type apple which may have multiple like or fan edges connected to it but no worked at edge connections. In particular embodiments the node threshold probability may differ for user nodes and concept nodes and may differ even among these nodes e.g. some concept nodes may have different node threshold probabilities than other concept nodes . As an example and not by way of limitation an n gram may be identified as corresponding to a user node k if p p while an n gram may be identified as corresponding to a concept node k if p p. In particular embodiments the social networking system may only identify nodes that are within a threshold degree of separation of the user node corresponding to the first user i.e. the querying user . The threshold degree of separation may be for example one two three or all. Although this disclosure describes identifying nodes that correspond to n grams in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates identifying nodes that correspond to n grams in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may access a context free grammar model comprising a plurality of grammars. Each grammar of the grammar model may comprise one or more non terminal tokens or non terminal symbols and one or more terminal tokens or terminal symbols query tokens where particular non terminal tokens may be replaced by terminal tokens. A grammar model is a set of formation rules for strings in a formal language. Although this disclosure describes accessing particular grammars this disclosure contemplates any suitable grammars.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may generate one or more strings using one or more grammars. To generate a string in the language one begins with a string consisting of only a single start symbol. The production rules are then applied in any order until a string that contains neither the start symbol nor designated non terminal symbols is produced. In a context free grammar the production of each non terminal symbol of the grammar is independent of what is produced by other non terminal symbols of the grammar. The non terminal symbols may be replaced with terminal symbols i.e. terminal tokens or query tokens . Some of the query tokens may correspond to identified nodes or identified edges as described previously. A string generated by the grammar may then be used as the basis for a structured query containing references to the identified nodes or identified edges. The string generated by the grammar may be rendered in a natural language syntax such that a structured query based on the string is also rendered in natural language. A context free grammar is a grammar in which the left hand side of each production rule consists of only a single non terminal symbol. A probabilistic context free grammar is a tuple N S P where the disjoint sets and N specify the terminal and non terminal symbols respectively with S N being the start symbol. P is the set of productions which take the form E p with E N N and p Pr E the probability that E will be expanded into the string . The sum of probabilities p over all expansions of a given non terminal E must be one. Although this disclosure describes generating strings in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating strings in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may identify one or more query tokens corresponding to the previously identified nodes and edges. In other words if an identified node or identified edge may be used as a query token in a particular grammar that query token may be identified by the social networking system . As an example and not by way of limitation an example grammar may be user user filter school . The non terminal symbols user user filter and school could then be determined based n grams in the received text query. For the text query friends stanford this query could be parsed by using the grammar as for example friends who go to Stanford University or friends who work at Stanford University . As another example and not by way of limitation an example grammar may be user user filter location . For the text query friends stanford this query could be parsed by using the grammar as for example friends who live in Stanford Calif. . In both the example cases above if the n grams of the received text query could be used as query tokens then these query tokens may be identified by the social networking system . Although this disclosure describes identifying particular query tokens in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates identifying any suitable query tokens in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may select one or more grammars having at least one query token corresponding to each of the previously identified nodes and edges. Only particular grammars may be used depending on the n grams identified in the text query. So the terminal tokens of all available grammars should be examined to find those that match the identified n grams from the text query. In other words if a particular grammar can use all of the identified nodes and edges as query tokens that grammar may be selected by the social networking system as a possible grammar to use for generating a structured query. This is effectively a type of bottom up parsing where the possible query tokens are used to determine the applicable grammar to apply to the query. As an example and not by way of limitation for the text query friends stanford the social networking system may identify the query tokens of friends and Stanford University . Terminal tokens of the grammars from the grammar model may be identified as previously discussed. Any grammar that is able to use both the friends and the Stanford University tokens may then be selected. For example the grammar user user filter school may be selected because this grammar could use the friends and the Stanford University tokens as query tokens such as by forming the strings friends who go to Stanford University or friends who work at Stanford University . Thus if the n grams of the received text query could be used as query tokens in the grammars then these grammars may be selected by the social networking system . Similarly if the received text query comprises n grams that could not be used as query tokens in the grammar that grammar may not be selected. Although this disclosure describes selecting particular grammars in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates selecting any suitable grammars in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may select one or more grammars by analyzing a grammar forest formed by a plurality of grammars. The grammar forest may be organized as an ordered tree comprising a plurality of non terminal tokens and a plurality of terminal tokens. Each grammar may be represented as a sub tree within the grammar forest and each sub tree may adjoin other sub trees via one or more additional non terminal tokens. As an example and not by way of limitation the social networking system may start by identifying all the terminal tokens i.e. query tokens in the grammar forest that correspond to identified nodes and edges corresponding to portions of a text query. Once these query tokens in the grammar forest have been identified the social networking system may then traverse the grammar forest up from each of these query tokens to identify one or more intersecting non terminal tokens. Once a non terminal token has been identified where paths from all the query tokens intersect that intersecting non terminal token may be selected and the one or more grammars adjoined to that intersecting non terminal token in the grammar forest may then be selected. Although this disclosure describes selecting grammars in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates selecting grammars in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine a score for each selected grammar. The score may be for example a confidence score a probability a quality a ranking another suitable type of score or any combination thereof. The score may be based on the individual scores or probabilities associated with the query tokens used in the selected grammar. A grammar may have a higher relative score if it uses query tokens with relatively higher individual scores. As an example and not by way of limitation continuing with the prior examples the n gram stanford could be scored with respect to the following social graph elements as follows school Stanford University 0.7 location Stanford Calif. 0.2 user Allen Stanford 0.1. The n gram friends could be scored with respect to the following social graph elements as follows user friends 0.9 television show Friends 0.1. Thus the grammar user user filter school may have a relatively high score if it uses the query tokens for the user friends and the school Stanford University generating for example the string friends who go to Stanford University both of which have relatively high individual scores. In contrast the grammar user user filter user may have relatively low score if it uses the query tokens for the user friends and the user Allen Stanford generating for example the string friends of Allen Stanford since the latter query token has a relatively low individual score. In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine a score for a selected grammar based on the lengths of the paths traversed in order to identify the intersect token corresponding to the selected grammar. Grammars with lower cost multi paths i.e. shorter paths may be scored more highly than grammars with high cost multi paths i.e. longer paths . In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine a score for a selected grammar based on advertising sponsorship. An advertiser such as for example the user or administrator of a particular profile page corresponding to a particular node may sponsor a particular node such that a grammar that includes a query token referencing that sponsored node may be scored more highly. Although this disclosure describes determining particular scores for particular grammars in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates determining any suitable scores for any suitable grammars in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine the score for a selected grammar based on the relevance of the social graph elements corresponding to the query tokens of the grammar to the querying user i.e. the first user corresponding to a first user node . User nodes and concept nodes that are connected to the first user node directly by an edge may be considered relevant to the first user. Thus grammars comprising query tokens corresponding to these relevant nodes and edges may be considered more relevant to the querying user. As an example and not by way of limitation a concept node connected by an edge to a first user node may be considered relevant to the first user node . As used herein when referencing a social graph the term connected means a path exists within the social graph between two nodes wherein the path may comprise one or more edges and zero or more intermediary nodes. In particular embodiments nodes that are connected to the first user node via one or more intervening nodes and therefore two or more edges may also be considered relevant to the first user. Furthermore in particular embodiments the closer the second node is to the first user node the more relevant the second node may be considered to the first user node. That is the fewer edges separating the first user node from a particular user node or concept node i.e. the fewer degrees of separation the more relevant that user node or concept node may be considered to the first user. As an example and not by way of limitation as illustrated in the concept node corresponding to the school Stanford is connected to the user node corresponding to User C and thus the concept Stanford may be considered relevant to User C. As another example and not by way of limitation the user node corresponding to User A is connected to the user node corresponding to User C via one intermediate node and two edges i.e. the intermediated user node corresponding to User B and thus User A may be considered relevant to User C but because the user node for User A is a second degree connection with respect to User C that particular concept node may be considered less relevant than a user node that is connected to the user node for User C by a single edge such as for example the user node corresponding to User B. As yet another example and not by way of limitation the concept node for Online Poker which may correspond to an online multiplayer game is not connected to the user node for User C by any pathway in social graph and thus the concept Online Poker may not be considered relevant to User C. In particular embodiments a second node may only be considered relevant to the first user if the second node is within a threshold degree of separation of the first user node . As an example and not by way of limitation if the threshold degree of separation is three then the user node corresponding to User D may be considered relevant to the concept node corresponding to the recipe Chicken Parmesan which are within three degrees of each other on social graph illustrated in . However continuing with this example the concept node corresponding to the application All About Recipes would not be considered relevant to the user node corresponding to User D because these nodes are four degrees apart in the social graph . Although this disclosure describes determining whether particular social graph elements and thus their corresponding query tokens are relevant to each other in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates determining whether any suitable social graph elements are relevant to each other in any suitable manner. Moreover although this disclosure describes determining whether particular query tokens corresponding to user nodes and concept nodes are relevant to a querying user this disclosure contemplates similarly determining whether any suitable query token and thus any suitable node is relevant to any other suitable user.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine the score for a selected grammar based social graph information corresponding to the query tokens of the grammar. As an example and not by way of limitation when determining a probability p that an n gram corresponds to a particular social graph element the calculation of the probability may also factor in social graph information. Thus the probability of corresponding to a particular social graph element k given a particular search query X and social graph information G may be calculated as p k X G . The individual probabilities for the identified nodes and edges may then be used to determine the score for a grammar using those social graph elements as query tokens. In particular embodiments the score for a selected grammar may be based on the degree of separation between the first user node and the particular social graph element used as a query token in the grammar. Grammars with query tokens corresponding to social graph elements that are closer in the social graph to the querying user i.e. fewer degrees of separation between the element and the first user node may be scored more highly than grammars using query tokens corresponding to social graph elements that are further from the user i.e. more degrees of separation . As an example and not by way of limitation referencing if user B inputs a text query of chicken a grammar with a query token corresponding to the concept node for the recipe Chicken Parmesan which is connected to user B by an edge may have a relatively higher score than a grammar with a query token corresponding to other nodes associated with the n gram chicken e.g. concept nodes corresponding to chicken nuggets or funky chicken dance that are not connected to user B in the social graph . In particular embodiments the score for a selected grammar may be based on the identified edges corresponding to the query tokens of the grammar. If the social networking system has already identified one or more edges that correspond to n grams in a received text query those identified edges may then be considered when determining the score for a particular parsing of the text query by the grammar. If a particular grammar comprises query tokens that correspond to both identified nodes and identified edges if the identified nodes are not actually connected to any of the identified edges that particular grammar may be assigned a zero or null score. In particular embodiments the score for a selected grammar may be based on the number of edges connected to the nodes corresponding to query tokens of the grammar. Grammars comprising query tokens that corresponding to nodes with more connecting edges may be more popular and more likely to be a target of a search query. As an example and not by way of limitation if the concept node for Stanford Calif. is only connected by five edges while the concept node for Stanford University is connected by five thousand edges when determining the score for grammars containing query tokens corresponding to either of these nodes the social networking system may determine that the grammar with a query token corresponding to the concept node for Stanford University has a relatively higher score than a grammar referencing the concept node for Stanford Calif. because of the greater number of edges connected to the former concept node . In particular embodiments the score for a selected grammar may be based on the search history associate with the first user i.e. the querying user . Grammars with query tokens corresponding to nodes that the first user has previously accessed or are relevant to the nodes the first user has previously accessed may be more likely to be the target of the first user s search query. Thus these grammars may be given a higher score. As an example and not by way of limitation if first user has previously visited the Stanford University profile page but has never visited the Stanford Calif. profile page when determining the score for grammars with query tokens corresponding to these concepts the social networking system may determine that the concept node for Stanford University has a relatively high score and thus the grammar using the corresponding query token because the querying user has previously accessed the concept node for the school. As another example and not by way of limitation if the first user has previously visited the concept profile page for the television show Friends when determining the score for the grammar with the query token corresponding to that concept the social networking system may determine that the concept node corresponding to the television show Friends has a relatively high score and thus the grammar using the corresponding query token because the querying user has previously accessed the concept node for that television show. Although this disclosure describes determining scores for particular grammars based on particular social graph information in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates determining scores for any suitable grammars based on any suitable social graph information in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may select one or more grammars having a score greater than a grammar threshold score. Each of the selected grammars may contain query tokens that correspond to each of the identified nodes or identified edges which correspond to n grams of the received text query . In particular embodiments the grammars may be ranked based on their determined scores and only grammars within a threshold rank may be selected e.g. top seven . Although this disclosure describes selecting grammars in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates selecting grammars in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may generate one or more structured queries corresponding to the selected grammars e.g. those grammars having a score greater than a grammar threshold score . Each structured query may be based on a string generated by the corresponding selected grammar. As an example and not by way of limitation in response to the text query friends stanford the grammar user user filter school may generate a string friends who go to Stanford University where the non terminal tokens user user filter school of the grammar have been replaced by the terminal tokens friends who go to and Stanford University respectively to generate the string. In particular embodiments a string that is generated by grammar using a natural language syntax may be rendered as a structured query in natural language. As an example and not by way of limitation the structured query from the previous example uses the terminal token who go to which uses a natural language syntax so that the string rendered by grammar is in natural language. The natural language string generated by a grammar may then be rendered to form a structured query by modifying the query tokens corresponding to social graph element to include references to those social graph elements. As an example and not by way of limitation the string friends who go to Stanford University may be rendered so that the query token for Stanford University appears in the structured query as a reference to the concept node corresponding to the school Stanford University where the reference may be include highlighting an inline link a snippet another suitable reference or any combination thereof. Each structured query may comprise query tokens corresponding to the corresponding selected grammar where these query tokens correspond to one or more of the identified edges and one or more of the identified nodes. Generating structured queries is described more below.

In particular embodiments in response to a text query received from a first user i.e. the querying user social networking system may generate one or more structured queries rendered in a natural language syntax where each structured query includes query tokens that correspond to one or more identified social graph elements. Structured queries may allow a querying user to search for content that is connected to particular users or concepts in the social graph by particular edge types. As an example and not by way of limitation social networking system may receive an unstructured text query from a first user. In response social networking system via for example a server side element detection process may access the social graph and then parse the text query to identify social graph elements that corresponded to n grams from the text query. Social networking system may then access a grammar model such as a context free grammar model which includes a plurality of grammars described below. The identified social graph elements may be used as terminal tokens query tokens in the grammar. The selected grammars may then be used to generate one or more structured queries that include the query tokens referencing the identified social graph elements. These structured queries may be based on strings generated by the grammars such that they are rendered with references to the appropriate social graph elements using a natural language syntax. The structured queries may be displayed in a drop down menu via for example a client side typeahead process where the first user can then select an appropriate query to search for the desired content. Some of the advantages of using the structured queries described herein include finding users of the online social network based upon limited information bringing together virtual indexes of content from the online social network based on the relation of that content to various social graph elements or finding content related to you and or your friends. By using this process the output of the natural language rendering process may be efficiently parsed for example to generate modified or alternative structured queries. Furthermore since the rules used by this process are derived from the grammar model any modification to the rules of the grammar model can be immediately reflected in the rendering process. Although this disclosure describes and illustrates generating particular structured queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating any suitable structured queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may receive from a querying first user corresponding to a first user node an unstructured text query. As an example and not by way of limitation a first user may want to search for other users who 1 are first degree friends of the first user and 2 are associated with Stanford University i.e. the user nodes are connected by an edge to the concept node corresponding to the school Stanford . The first user may then enter a text query friends stanford into search query field . As used herein reference to an unstructured text query may refer to a simple text string inputted by a user. The text query may of course be structured with respect to standard language grammar rules e.g. English language grammar . However the text query will ordinarily be unstructured with respect to social graph elements. In other words a simple text query will not ordinarily include embedded references to particular social graph elements. Thus as used herein a structured query refers to a query that contains references to particular social graph elements allowing the search engine to search based on the identified elements. Furthermore the text query may be unstructured with respect to formal query syntax. In other words a simple text query will not necessarily be in the format of a query command that is directly executable by a search engine. Although this disclosure describes receiving particular queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates receiving any suitable queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments in response to a structured query received from a querying user the social networking system may generate one or more search results where each search result matches or substantially matches the terms of the structured query. The social networking system may receive a structured query from a querying user. In response to the structured query the social networking system may generate one or more search results corresponding to the structured query. Each search result may include link to a profile page and a description or summary of the profile page or the node corresponding to that page . The search results may be presented and transmitted to the querying user as a search results page. The structured query used to generate a particular search results page is shown in query field and the various search results generated in response to the structured query are illustrated in a field for presented search results. In particular embodiments the query field may also serve as the title bar for the page. In other words the title bar and query field may effectively be a unified field on the search results page. The search results page may also include a field for modifying search results and a field for providing suggested searches. When generating the search results the social networking system may generate one or more snippets for each search result where the snippets are contextual information about the target of the search result i.e. contextual information about the social graph entity profile page or other content corresponding to the particular search result . Although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular search results pages this disclosure contemplates any suitable search results pages.

More information on generating search results may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 731 939 filed 31 Dec. 2012 which is incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments mobile client system many include a communication component coupled to antennae A B for communicating with an Ethernet or other wire based network or a wireless NIC WNIC wireless adapter for communicating with a wireless network such as for example a WI FI network or modem for communicating with a cellular network such third generation mobile telecommunications 3G or Long Term Evolution LTE network. This disclosure contemplates any suitable network and any suitable communication component for it. As an example and not by way of limitation mobile client system may communicate with an ad hoc network a personal area network PAN a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN a metropolitan area network MAN or one or more portions of the Internet or a combination of two or more of these. One or more portions of one or more of these networks may be wired or wireless. As another example mobile client system may communicate with a wireless PAN WPAN such as for example a BLUETOOTH WPAN a WI FI network a WI MAX network a cellular telephone network such as for example a Global System for Mobile Communications GSM 3G or LTE network or other suitable wireless network or a combination of two or more of these. Mobile client system may include any suitable communication component for any of these networks where appropriate.

In particular embodiments mobile client system may generate one or more structured queries based query tokens which may be divided into grammar tokens and completion tokens that may be selected by a querying user. As an example and not by way of limitation structured queries may be generated by selecting one or more grammar tokens and subsequently one or more completion tokens . Herein reference to a grammar token may refer to one or more social graph elements of a partial structured query. As an example and not by way of limitation grammar tokens of a structured query may correspond to partial structured queries such as Photos of . . . Friends of . . . or Pages liked by . . . and which contain references to particular social graph elements as described below. Herein reference to a completion token may refer to a one or more social graph elements that completes a structured query that includes a grammar token. As an example and not by way of limitation completion tokens of a structured query may correspond to partial structured queries such as . . . my friends . . . current location or . . . New York and which contain references to particular social graph elements as described below. In particular embodiments grammar tokens or completion tokens may be based on a natural language string. A type associated with the social graph elements referenced by the grammar token may be used to determine one or more completion tokens subsequently displayed to the querying user. In particular embodiments a grammar tokens page may be auto populated in the null state with one or more grammar tokens. Selection of a particular grammar token A may act to lock in the nodes or edges referenced by grammar token A into the search query. In particular embodiments a completion token displayed in completion token page may be used to add one or more terms and complete structured query A. As an example and not by way of limitation completion tokens displayed in completion token page may correspond to particular types of matching social graph elements of the selected grammar token A. In particular embodiments the querying user may want to modify completed structured query A to further refine search results through use of modifying completion tokens . As an example and not by way of limitation a modified structured query B may be generated that incorporates the additional node and additional edge referenced in the selected modifying completion token A. Although this disclosure describes generating structured queries in a particular manner on a particular type of client system this disclosure contemplates generating structured queries in any suitable manner on any suitable type of client system.

As described above one or more structured queries may include one or more grammar tokens and one or more completion tokens . In particular embodiments mobile client system may access one or more grammar tokens in response to accessing search query field . Grammar tokens may correspond to a particular grammar used by grammar models described above. In particular embodiments grammar tokens may include references to one or more nodes or one or more edges from the social graph . The querying user may select a grammar token that references particular nodes edges of social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation illustrates an example grammar tokens page generated in response to detecting an input corresponding to initiating a search such as for example a touch input in search query field . As illustrated in the example of grammar tokens page may be auto populated in the null state with grammar tokens . In particular embodiments grammar tokens displayed in the null state may be derived based at least in part on popular search queries preferences of the querying user business intelligence or any combination thereof. In particular embodiments mobile client system may parse an unstructured text query also simply referred to as a search query received from the querying user to identify one or more n grams. As an example and not by way of limitation grammar tokens displayed in grammar token page may be ranked or modified in response to text provided in search query field and which may also work in conjunction with the typeahead functionality described previously. For example the querying user typing ph in search query field may be provided grammar tokens Photos of . . . Photos by . . . or Photos from . . . . As another example mobile client system may filter out grammar tokens that do not match the provided text or identified n grams such as for example Pages liked by . . . .

In particular embodiments the displayed grammar tokens may include a graphical element that may provide an indication of a type of social graph elements that are referenced by the search results of the structured query corresponding to each grammar token . As an example and not by way of limitation grammar token Photos of . . . may have a graphical element A indicating the search results associated with this grammar token may include references to images. As another example grammar token Friends of . . . may have a graphical element B indicating the search results associated with this grammar token may include references to profile pages of second users. Grammar tokens displayed in grammar tokens page may include references to particular nodes and edges used in structured queries corresponding to each grammar token . The querying user may then select one or more of these grammar tokens to generate a partial structured query. As illustrated by the example of the querying user may select grammar token A Friends of . . . through a touch input detected by a touch sensor of mobile client system . As an example and not by way of limitation grammar token A Friends of . . . may reference user nodes connected to the querying user by a friend type edge .

In particular embodiments selection of a particular grammar token A may act to lock in the nodes or edges referenced by grammar token A into the search query. As illustrated by the example of search query field may be auto populated with a partial structured query corresponding to the selected grammar token A. In particular embodiments mobile client system may access one or more completion tokens in response to selection of a particular grammar token . An example completion tokens page may display completion tokens in response to subsequently receiving an input corresponding to selection of a grammar token A. For example completion tokens may correspond to a social graph element associated with the querying user such as for example photos or profile of users connected to the querying user through a friend type edge . In particular embodiments completion token page may display a pre determined list of completion tokens . As an example and not by way of limitation one or more completion tokens displayed in completion token page may correspond to particular types of matching social graph elements of the selected grammar token A. For example in the case of grammar token Pages liked by . . . corresponding completion tokens may include users connected to the querying user through a friend type edge . In particular embodiments each completion token may be based on a natural language string that corresponds to a natural language string of selected grammar token A.

Completion tokens displayed in completion token page may be used to complete structured query A. As an example and not by way of limitation selection of one of completion tokens may add one or more terms to complete structured query A. By providing these suggested completion tokens to the querying user the social networking system may provide a way for users to search for exactly what they are looking for. As described above completion tokens may include references to one or more nodes or one or more edges of the social graph . In particular embodiments one or more completion tokens may be used to add a reference to one or more nodes or edges to complete structured query A. The querying user may then select one or more of these completion tokens to add the nodes edges to complete partial structured query . Example completion tokens page illustrated in the example of may be generated in response to selection of grammar token A Friends of . . . . As an example and not by way of limitation the querying user may want to complete structured query A by specifying a particular user corresponding to user nodes connected to the querying user by a friend type edge . In this case completion tokens page illustrated in the examples of may display completion tokens that correspond to particular users such as for example Ryan L. Russ Maschmeyer and Mark Z. among others. As another example and not by way of limitation completion tokens may be identified as part of a typeahead process and displayed in response to subsequent text input. Continuing with the example illustrated in if the user inputs the character r the list of completion tokens may be refined to show Ryan L. Russ Maschmeyer and other users having names beginning with r while removing Mark Z. and other user from the list of possible completion tokens. In particular embodiments the displayed completion tokens may be derived from the top ranked results of a search index of users or user vertical stored on social networking system . As another example completion tokens displayed in completion tokens page may be ranked based at least in part on the selected grammar token A and the affinity of the social graph elements associated with selected grammar token A. For example in a case where the querying user selects a particular grammar token e.g. Photos of . . . a completion token corresponding to user A may be ranked higher than completion token corresponding to user B. In contrast in the case where the querying user selects different but similar grammar token e.g. Photos by . . . completion token corresponding to user B may be ranked higher than completion token corresponding to user A. In other words when grammar token Photos of . . . is selected photos of user A may be ranked higher than photos of user B. In contrast when grammar token Photos by . . . is selected photos taken by user B may be ranked higher than photos taken by user A.

The querying user may then select one or more of these completion tokens to add the referenced nodes or edges to complete partial structured query thereby filtering the search results by particular social graph elements. As illustrated in the example of the selection may be performed through a input by the querying user such as for example a touch input on the display of mobile client . As an example and not by way of limitation the querying user may select completion token A . . . my friends that corresponds to user nodes with a higher degree of separation from user node of the querying user. In response to the selection from the querying user mobile client system may complete structured query A to include a reference to the added social graph elements. As illustrated in the example of once completion token A is selected e.g. through an input by the querying user completed structured query A may be generated using an appropriate grammar such that the completed structured query A is rendered using a natural language syntax. Although this disclosure describes generating structured queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating structured queries in any suitable manner. In particular embodiments completed structured query A may be sent to social networking system in response to selection of one or more completion tokens A. In particular embodiments completed structured query A may be sent to social networking system in response to an input provided by the querying user such as for example clicking a graphical element of completion tokens page .

As illustrated in the example of an example search results page of mobile client system may display search results returned by social networking system in response to receiving completed structured query A. In particular embodiments search results may correspond to the type of social graph elements indicated by the graphical element A B associated with selected grammar token A as described above. As an example and not by way of limitation search results page illustrated in the example of may display search results that includes one or more profile pages that match a type of social graph elements indicated by graphical element B associated with selected grammar token A or that correspond to particular types of matching social graph elements of the selected grammar token A.

The querying user may want to modify completed structured query A to refine search results . In particular embodiments search results may be refined through use of modifying completion tokens . Furthermore modifying completion tokens may be clustered into particular categories . As an example and not by way of limitation categories may correspond to modifying completion tokens associated with Employer School Current City Hometown Relationship Status Interested in Friendship Gender Name Likes or any combination thereof. As illustrated in the example of an example category page may display one or more categories of modifying completion tokens in response to receiving an input corresponding to an indication the querying user may want to modify completed structured query A. As an example and not by way of limitation may access category page for example by clicking or otherwise selecting a particular graphic element e.g. a button or by accessing search query field . In particular embodiments the querying user may select one or more modifying completion tokens associated with particular categories . As illustrated in the example of the querying user may modify completed structured query A by providing an input selecting category A Current City .

As illustrated in the example of example modification page may display modifying completion tokens corresponding to the selected category A. In particular embodiments modifying completion tokens may include references to one or more modifying nodes or one or more modifying edges of social graph . As described above modifying completion tokens may be ranked and displayed on example modification page . In particular embodiments mobile client system may generate a modified structured query B in response to a selection of one or more of the modifying completion tokens . In particular embodiments mobile client system may generate a modified structured query B comprising references to the selected nodes and the selected edges from the completed structured query A and each modifying node or modifying edge referenced in the selected modifying completion token A. As an example and not by way of limitation for the completed structured query A Friends of my friends and selected category A Current City mobile client system may generate modifying completion token A New York New York which may reference connections to the concept node for New York by a live in type edge . Mobile client system may then generate modified structured query B Friends of my friends who live in New York which incorporates the additional node and additional edge referenced in the selected modifying completion token A.

In particular embodiments the querying user may modify completed structured query A to further refine search results by selecting modifying completion tokens through completion tokens page illustrated in the example of . As an example and not by way of limitation completion tokens page may be displayed in response to the querying user providing an input indicating the querying user may want to modify completed structured query A such as for example accessing search query field . As another example modifying completion tokens may be identified as part of a typeahead process and displayed in response to subsequent text input. In particular embodiments one or more modifying completion tokens displayed in completion token page may correspond to particular types of matching social graph elements of the completed structured query A. In particular embodiments each modifying completion token may be based on a natural language string that corresponds to a natural language string of the selected grammar token A and completion token A. As described below modified completion tokens may be ranked based at least in part on the selected grammar token A and the affinity of the social graph elements associated with selected grammar token A. Although this disclosure describes generating particular modified structured queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating any suitable modified structured queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may score one or more completion tokens to complete a structured query . In particular embodiments when generating a set of completion tokens to display to a querying user only those completion tokens having a score greater than a threshold score may be included in the set of query modifications that are actually transmitted. The threshold score may include for example a confidence score a probability a quality a ranking another suitable type of score or any combination thereof. As an example and not by way of limitation the social networking system may determine a ranking for each completion token where only the top six ranked completion tokens are displayed to the querying user. In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine a score for a completion token based on the social relevance of completion token to partial structured query . Completion tokens that reference social graph elements that are more closely connected or otherwise relevant to the querying user may be scored more highly than completion tokens that reference social graph elements that are not as closely connected or are otherwise less relevant to the querying user.

In particular embodiments modifying completion tokens may be scored similarly. In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine a score for modifying completion tokens based on a search history associated with the querying user. Modifying completion tokens referencing social graph elements that the querying user has previously accessed or are relevant to nodes profile pages the querying user has previously accessed may be more likely to be relevant to the user s modified structured query B. Thus these modifying completion tokens may be given a higher relative score. As an example and not by way of limitation if the querying user has previously search for My friends at Stanford University then the social networking system may determine that the querying user is interested in user nodes connected to the concept node for Stanford University. Thus in response to subsequent queries the social networking system may rank modifying completion tokens referencing Stanford University more highly than other modifying completion tokens because of the querying user s history of interest in that type of contextual information. Although this disclosure describes scoring completion or modifying completion tokens in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates scoring completion or modifying completion tokens in any suitable manner.

As illustrated in the example of an example search results page of mobile client system may display search results returned by social networking system in response to receiving modified structured query B. In particular embodiments search results page illustrated in the example of may display search results that correspond to particular types of matching social graph elements of selected modifying completion token A as well as completed structured query A.

In particular embodiments social networking system may determine the social graph affinity which may be referred to herein as affinity of various social graph entities for each other. Affinity may represent the strength of a relationship or level of interest between particular objects associated with the online social network such as users concepts content actions advertisements other objects associated with the online social network or any suitable combination thereof. Affinity may also be determined with respect to objects associated with third party systems or other suitable systems. An overall affinity for a social graph entity for each user subject matter or type of content may be established. The overall affinity may change based on continued monitoring of the actions or relationships associated with the social graph entity. Although this disclosure describes determining particular affinities in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates determining any suitable affinities in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may measure or quantify social graph affinity using an affinity coefficient which may be referred to herein as coefficient . The coefficient may represent or quantify the strength of a relationship between particular objects associated with the online social network. The coefficient may also represent a probability or function that measures a predicted probability that a user will perform a particular action based on the user s interest in the action. In this way a user s future actions may be predicted based on the user s prior actions where the coefficient may be calculated at least in part on a history of the user s actions. Coefficients may be used to predict any number of actions which may be within or outside of the online social network. As an example and not by way of limitation these actions may include various types of communications such as sending messages posting content or commenting on content various types of an observation actions such as accessing or viewing profile pages media or other suitable content various types of coincidence information about two or more social graph entities such as being in the same group tagged in the same photograph checked in at the same location or attending the same event or other suitable actions. Although this disclosure describes measuring affinity in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates measuring affinity in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may use a variety of factors to calculate a coefficient. These factors may include for example user actions types of relationships between objects location information other suitable factors or any combination thereof. In particular embodiments different factors may be weighted differently when calculating the coefficient. The weights for each factor may be static or the weights may change according to for example the user the type of relationship the type of action the user s location and so forth. Ratings for the factors may be combined according to their weights to determine an overall coefficient for the user. As an example and not by way of limitation particular user actions may be assigned both a rating and a weight while a relationship associated with the particular user action is assigned a rating and a correlating weight e.g. so the weights total 100 . To calculate the coefficient of a user towards a particular object the rating assigned to the user s actions may comprise for example 60 of the overall coefficient while the relationship between the user and the object may comprise 40 of the overall coefficient. In particular embodiments the social networking system may consider a variety of variables when determining weights for various factors used to calculate a coefficient such as for example the time since information was accessed decay factors frequency of access relationship to information or relationship to the object about which information was accessed relationship to social graph entities connected to the object short or long term averages of user actions user feedback other suitable variables or any combination thereof. As an example and not by way of limitation a coefficient may include a decay factor that causes the strength of the signal provided by particular actions to decay with time such that more recent actions are more relevant when calculating the coefficient. The ratings and weights may be continuously updated based on continued tracking of the actions upon which the coefficient is based. Any type of process or algorithm may be employed for assigning combining averaging and so forth the ratings for each factor and the weights assigned to the factors. In particular embodiments social networking system may determine coefficients using machine learning algorithms trained on historical actions and past user responses or data farmed from users by exposing them to various options and measuring responses. Although this disclosure describes calculating coefficients in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates calculating coefficients in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on a user s actions. Social networking system may monitor such actions on the online social network on a third party system on other suitable systems or any combination thereof. Any suitable type of user actions may be tracked or monitored. Typical user actions include viewing profile pages creating or posting content interacting with content tagging or being tagged in images joining groups listing and confirming attendance at events checking in at locations liking particular pages creating pages and performing other tasks that facilitate social action. In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on the user s actions with particular types of content. The content may be associated with the online social network a third party system or another suitable system. The content may include users profile pages posts news stories headlines instant messages chat room conversations emails advertisements pictures video music other suitable objects or any combination thereof. Social networking system may analyze a user s actions to determine whether one or more of the actions indicate an affinity for subject matter content other users and so forth. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user may make frequently posts content related to coffee or variants thereof social networking system may determine the user has a high coefficient with respect to the concept coffee . Particular actions or types of actions may be assigned a higher weight and or rating than other actions which may affect the overall calculated coefficient. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user emails a second user the weight or the rating for the action may be higher than if the first user simply views the user profile page for the second user.

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on the type of relationship between particular objects. Referencing the social graph social networking system may analyze the number and or type of edges connecting particular user nodes and concept nodes when calculating a coefficient. As an example and not by way of limitation user nodes that are connected by a spouse type edge representing that the two users are married may be assigned a higher coefficient than a user nodes that are connected by a friend type edge. In other words depending upon the weights assigned to the actions and relationships for the particular user the overall affinity may be determined to be higher for content about the user s spouse than for content about the user s friend. In particular embodiments the relationships a user has with another object may affect the weights and or the ratings of the user s actions with respect to calculating the coefficient for that object. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user is tagged in first photo but merely likes a second photo social networking system may determine that the user has a higher coefficient with respect to the first photo than the second photo because having a tagged in type relationship with content may be assigned a higher weight and or rating than having a like type relationship with content. In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient for a first user based on the relationship one or more second users have with a particular object. In other words the connections and coefficients other users have with an object may affect the first user s coefficient for the object. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user is connected to or has a high coefficient for one or more second users and those second users are connected to or have a high coefficient for a particular object social networking system may determine that the first user should also have a relatively high coefficient for the particular object. In particular embodiments the coefficient may be based on the degree of separation between particular objects. The lower coefficient may represent the decreasing likelihood that the first user will share an interest in content objects of the user that is indirectly connected to the first user in the social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation social graph entities that are closer in the social graph i.e. fewer degrees of separation may have a higher coefficient than entities that are further apart in the social graph .

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on location information. Objects that are geographically closer to each other may be considered to be more related or of more interest to each other than more distant objects. In particular embodiments the coefficient of a user towards a particular object may be based on the proximity of the object s location to a current location associated with the user or the location of a client system of the user . A first user may be more interested in other users or concepts that are closer to the first user. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user is one mile from an airport and two miles from a gas station social networking system may determine that the user has a higher coefficient for the airport than the gas station based on the proximity of the airport to the user.

In particular embodiments social networking system may perform particular actions with respect to a user based on coefficient information. Coefficients may be used to predict whether a user will perform a particular action based on the user s interest in the action. A coefficient may be used when generating or presenting any type of objects to a user such as advertisements search results news stories media messages notifications or other suitable objects. The coefficient may also be utilized to rank and order such objects as appropriate. In this way social networking system may provide information that is relevant to user s interests and current circumstances increasing the likelihood that they will find such information of interest. In particular embodiments social networking system may generate content based on coefficient information. Content objects may be provided or selected based on coefficients specific to a user. As an example and not by way of limitation the coefficient may be used to generate media for the user where the user may be presented with media for which the user has a high overall coefficient with respect to the media object. As another example and not by way of limitation the coefficient may be used to generate advertisements for the user where the user may be presented with advertisements for which the user has a high overall coefficient with respect to the advertised object. In particular embodiments social networking system may generate search results based on coefficient information. Search results for a particular user may be scored or ranked based on the coefficient associated with the search results with respect to the querying user. As an example and not by way of limitation search results corresponding to objects with higher coefficients may be ranked higher on a search results page than results corresponding to objects having lower coefficients.

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient in response to a request for a coefficient from a particular system or process. To predict the likely actions a user may take or may be the subject of in a given situation any process may request a calculated coefficient for a user. The request may also include a set of weights to use for various factors used to calculate the coefficient. This request may come from a process running on the online social network from a third party system e.g. via an API or other communication channel or from another suitable system. In response to the request social networking system may calculate the coefficient or access the coefficient information if it has previously been calculated and stored . In particular embodiments social networking system may measure an affinity with respect to a particular process. Different processes both internal and external to the online social network may request a coefficient for a particular object or set of objects. Social networking system may provide a measure of affinity that is relevant to the particular process that requested the measure of affinity. In this way each process receives a measure of affinity that is tailored for the different context in which the process will use the measure of affinity.
