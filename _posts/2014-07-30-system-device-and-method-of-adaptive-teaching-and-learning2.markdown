In some embodiments the teacher station and the student stations may be implemented using a common interface or an integrated platform e.g. an educational workstation such that a log in screen request the user to select or otherwise input his role e.g. teacher or student and or identity e.g. name or unique identifier .

In some embodiments system performs ongoing assessment of students performance based on their operation of student stations . For example instead of or in addition to conventional event based quizzes or examinations system monitors the successes and the failures of individual students in individual learning objects or learning activities. For example the teacher utilizes the teacher station to allocate or distribute various learning activities or learning objects to various students or groups of students. The teacher utilizes the teacher station to allocate a first learning object and a second learning object to a first group of students including Student A who utilizes student station and the teacher utilizes the teacher station to allocate the first learning object and a third learning object to a second group of students including Student B who utilizes student station .

System monitors logs and reports the performance of student based on their operation of student stations . For example system may determine and report that Student A successfully completed the first learning object whereas Student B failed to complete the second learning object. System may determine and report that Student A successfully completed the first learning object within a pre defined time period associated with the first learning object whereas Student B completed the second learning object within a time period longer than the required time period. System may determine and report that Student A successfully completed or answered 87 percent of tasks or questions in a learning object or a learning activity whereas Student B successfully completed or answered 45 percent of tasks or questions in a learning object or a learning activity. System may determine and report that Student A appears to be stuck or lingering on a particular exercise or learning object or that Student B did not operate the keyboard or mouse for a particular time period e.g. two minutes . System may determine and report that at least 80 percent of the students in the first group successfully completed at least 75 percent of their allocated learning activity or that at least 50 percent of the students in the second group failed to correctly answer at least 30 percent of questions allocated to them. Other types of determinations and reports may be used.

System generates reports at various times and using various methods for example based on the choice of the teacher utilizing the teacher station . For example the teacher station may generate one or more types of reports e.g. individual student reports group reports class reports an alert type message that alerts the teacher to a particular event e.g. failure or success of a student or a group of students or the like. Reports may be generated for example at the end of a lesson at particular times e.g. at a certain hour at pre defined time intervals e.g. every ten minutes every school day every week upon demand request or command of a teacher utilizing the teacher station upon a triggering event or when one or more conditions are met e.g. upon completion of a certain learning activity by a student or group of students a student failing a learning activity a pre defined percentage of students failing a learning activity a student succeeding in a learning activity a pre defined percentage of students succeeding in a learning activity or the like.

In some embodiments reports or alerts may be generated by system substantially in real time during the lesson process in class. For example system may alert the teacher using a graphical or textual or audible notification through the teacher station that one or more students or groups of students do not progress at all or according to pre defined mile stones in the learning activity or learning object assigned to them. Upon receiving the real time alert the teacher may utilize the teacher station to further retrieve details of the actual progress for example by obtaining detailed information on the progress of the relevant student s or group s . For example the teacher may use the teacher station to view a report detailing progress status of students e.g. whether the student started or not yet started a learning object or a learning activity the percentage of students in the class or in one or more groups that completed as assignment the progress of students in a learning object or a learning activity e.g. the student performed 40 percent of the learning activity the student is stuck for more than sixty seconds in front of the third question or the fourth screen of a learning object the student completed the assigned learning object and started to perform an optional learning object or the like.

In some embodiments teaching learning and or assessment activities are monitored recorded and stored in a format that allows subsequent searching querying and retrieval. Data mining processes in combination with reporting tools may perform research and may generate reports on various educational pedagogic and administrative entities for example on students single student a group of students all students in a class a grade a school or the like teachers a single teacher a group of teachers that teach the same grade and or in the same school and or the same discipline learning activities and related content and for conducting research and formative assessment for improvement of teaching methodologies flow or sequence of learning activities or the like.

In some embodiments data mining processes and analysis processes may be performed for example on knowledge maps of students on the tracked and logged operations that students perform on student stations on the tracked and logged operations that teachers perform on teacher stations or the like. The data mining and analysis may determine conclusions with regard to the performance the achievements the strengths the weaknesses the behavior and or other properties of one or more students teachers classes groups schools school districts national education systems multi national or international education systems or the like. In some embodiments analysis results may be used to compare among teaching and or learning at international level national level district level school level grade level class level group level student level or the like.

In some embodiments the generated repots are used as alternative or additional assessment of students performance students knowledge students classroom behavior e.g. a student is responsive to instructions a student is non responsive to instructions or other student parameters. In some embodiments for some assessment events information items e.g. rubrics may be created and or displayed to provide assessment related information to the teacher or to the teaching learning system the assessment information item may be visible to or accessible by the teacher and or the student e.g. subject to teacher s authorization . The assessment information item may include for example a built in or integrated information item inside an assessment event that provides instructions to the teacher or the teaching learning system on how to evaluate an assessment event which was executed by the student.

The educational content includes for example comprehensive educational content in accordance with full curriculum or portions thereof in digital format. The educational content includes originally generated or pre designed learning materials e.g. lessons exercises assignments or the like as well as learning materials created by modifying prior or other learning materials e.g. using editors templates or the like .

The teacher tools include for example tools for real time in class management of teaching and learning. This includes for example differential and or selective allocation of learning objects and or learning activities to students or groups of students monitoring the in class learning progress of students or groups of students approving or rejecting automatic suggestions by the system e.g. a suggestion to serve to Student B a tailored correction cycle or repeat exercise in a certain subject matter or the like.

The integrated evaluation and assessment module is able to perform integrated evaluation and assessment of substantially all learning activities e.g. by monitoring logging and dynamically reporting the performance of individual students through their learning. The integrated evaluation and assessment module is capable of dynamic knowledge mapping namely generating and or updating a knowledge map of a student a group of student a class a grade or the like. For example the integrated evaluation and assessment module may generate the knowledge map associated with Student B indicating that in the subject matter of mathematics Student B is proficient in addition and subtraction relatively strong in multiplication but relatively weak in division. The knowledge map may be generated and or updated for example upon demand e.g. by the teacher by the school principal or the like at the end of a lesson at the end of the week at pre defined time intervals upon completion of certain tasks e.g. learning objects or learning activities or the like.

The integrated evaluation and assessment module may substantially continuously monitor the learning activities of students utilizing the student stations and may generate e.g. in substantially real time alert messages and notifications e.g. transferred to the teacher station. For example the integrated evaluation and assessment module may be part of the student station and or the teacher station and or the school server and may determine that the user of a particular student station answered incorrectly a pre defined cumulative number of questions e.g. six incorrect answers cumulatively in a learning object that the user of a particular student station answered incorrectly a pre defined consecutive number of questions e.g. three incorrect answers consecutively in a learning object that the user of a particular student station answered incorrectly a pre defined percentage of tasks or questions in a learning activity or in a pre defined time period that the user of a particular student station did not operate its student station e.g. did not move the mouse did not click the mouse and or did not press a key on the keyboard for at least a pre defined time period e.g. two minutes or the like.

Upon such determination an alert message may be transferred to the teacher station e.g. from the student station from the school server or from the integrated evaluation and assessment module . Optionally additional notification may be presented to the student on the relevant student station e.g. alerting the attention of the student to the determined triggering event. Optionally additional help or support information e.g. educational content explanations narrations or the like may be presented to the student on the relevant student station either automatically or in response to a pre approval of the teacher using the teacher station.

The integrated evaluation and assessment module may be implemented within interactive learning activities and learning objects allowing ongoing monitoring of student progress. The integrated evaluation and assessment module may further allow LMS integration and may be implemented using management tools for managing tests assignments and question bank utilization. Additionally in some embodiments in which the teaching learning system is implemented using a Web environment knowledge mining may be performed for example by tracking and analysis of web based activity of students e.g. statistical analysis page view analysis time periods spent in viewing pages analysis or the like .

In some embodiments the integrated evaluation and assessment module may generate and update the actual knowledge map of the student thereby generating a dynamic representation of the student s learning curve . In view of the actual student map and in view of the desired or required or target knowledge map the teaching learning system may provide to students adaptive offering of educational content the adaptive offering may be provided directly to students automatically e.g. if the teacher allowed it in advance or may be first sent to the teacher for approval prior to sending the adaptive educational content to the student station.

The integrated evaluation and assessment module may determine and present to the teacher on the teacher station information regarding individual student performance group wide performance and or class wide performance. For example the teacher may use the teacher station to allocate a learning object to a group of ten students the learning object having three questions included therein. After a pre defined time period or upon demand by the teacher the integrated evaluation and assessment module may calculate and present to the teacher group wide evaluation indicating that the first question in the learning object was correctly answered by 70 percent of the students in the group the second question in the learning object was correctly answered by 30 percent of the students in the group and the third question in the learning object was correctly answered by 80 percent of the students in the group. The integrated evaluation and assessment module may be pre programmed to alert the teacher to identified situations in which less than a pre defined percentage of students e.g. less than 50 percent of students answer correctly a particular question. Therefore the integrated evaluation and assessment module may selectively alert the teacher that the second question in the learning object was correctly answered by 30 percent of the students in the group.

Alternatively the teacher station may present to the teacher the success rates of all the three questions optionally sorted from worse performance to best performance optionally highlighting or otherwise marking the second question in which the students performance was poor. The integrated evaluation and assessment module may compare and or analyze two continuously updated knowledge maps a required knowledge map derived from the curriculum and updated or refined by the teacher s choice of learning activities or their order of performance and a student s acquired knowledge map derived from the record of activities and performance of the particular student. The integrated evaluation and assessment module may dynamically and continuously or upon demand determine the gap or difference between the student s acquired knowledge map and the required knowledge map and may generate reports reflecting analysis results of that gap.

In some embodiments the integrated evaluation and assessment module may generate progress information reports per teacher per student per group of students per class per grade per school or the like. For example a progress information report for a student may include assignments completed by the student including the success rate and specific grades in each assignment a list of vocabulary learnt by the student and or calculated indications of the vocabulary learnt by the student e.g. an indication that based on the vocabulary related learning objects that the student performed the student is proficient with 84 percent of the vocabulary that he is required to learn a report of math exercises performed including details of success rates of math topics in which the student is strong or weak or the like.

The dynamic adaptation module is able to dynamically adapt or modify properties of the system content of the system and or operations of the system in order to accommodate various teaching styles of teachers various learning skills of students various preferences of teachers or the like. For example system may allow dynamic adaptation of the teaching learning process to the needs of the individual student e.g. by assigning to the student learning activities and learning objects or specific content within the learning object to accommodate the student s particular needs knowledge map and or past performance. Accordingly system may adapt and or provide additional assignments which may be tailored to the particular student based on his past performance optionally including hints or specific assistance with regard to selected portions of the learning object or learning activity e.g. special hints attached to questions audio narration added to text or the like .

Additionally a teacher intervention module may generate and present to the teacher various updates for example feedback progress reports alert messages system suggestions a notification about a student that succeeds or completes a learning activity or learning object a notification about a student that fails to complete a learning activity or learning object notifications about dynamically calculated grades of various students or the like. The teacher intervention module may allow the teacher to respond to the generated information and or to respond to input e.g. requests help request questions completion notifications comments or the like received from students e.g. through their student stations .

The LMS management and adaptation module includes for example a teaching services module to provide the teacher with various teaching services a learning management module to allow the teacher to manage the learning of individual students and or groups of students a differentiality module to allow differential teaching and differential learning e.g. by students or groups of students an assessment module to perform ongoing assessment of students groups of students or the entire class and a personal content module to generate and or store content associated with a particular teacher or class.

The teacher tools include for example a lesson planning module to allow the teacher to plan and prepare a lesson e.g. before class begins using a drag and drop interface to select and place learning objects or learning activities onto sequencing bars or the like .

The teacher tools further include a real time class management module to allow the teacher to see on the teacher station the status and progress of each student and or each group of students during actual learning in class. The real time class management module further allows for example selective activation or de activation of teaching accessories or equipment and selective activation and or projection of a learning object e.g. which may be used as integral part of presenting explaining and discussing a topic in class . The real time class management module further allows activation or unlocking of a learning object or a learning activity thereby sending it to one or more students or making it available to them.

The real time class management module further allows the teacher to view on the teacher station the status and progress of teaching peripherals e.g. the projector Internet connection communication tools or the like . The teacher tools further includes a module for differential assigning of content and activities to individual students or to groups of students a discussions module to allow initiation and execution of discussions e.g. among students or among the teacher and one or more students and an assessment and reporting module to allow the teacher to obtain current assessment of students or groups of students e.g. including a knowledge map .

The assessment and reporting module may calculate the percentage of exercises of assignments completed successfully by individual students or groups of students and may transfer the calculated data to a school server for further processing or utilization. The assessment and reporting module allows the teacher to selectively give or modify weight in the total assessment score to a particular activity object assignment or question allows the teacher to add assessment to portions of the assignment that cannot be efficiently or accurately evaluated by automatic tools e.g. an open question to which the student is required to answer using his free style text and allows the teacher to override or modify scores calculated automatically by the system based on automated checking of students results and performance.

Optionally these reports may be accesses by the student any time at his discretion or at pre defined pedagogic milestones e.g. end of term end of study unit end of the study of a certain topic to assist self assessment processes.

The knowledge map may indicate for example that the student is strong in math and weak in literature that the student is strong in verbal communication of ideas but weak in writing that the student is strong in multiplication and weak in division that the student is strong in comparing numbers that have an easily identifiable common denominator but is weak in comparing numbers that do not have an easily identifiable common denominator or the like.

These indications of the knowledge map the personal study map the student s learning curve and or the progress reports together with the real time reporting features and alerts e.g. as created by the alerts module of may provide the teacher valuable information for managing the pedagogic process for example indicating to the teacher that a certain teaching or learning process did not produce the planed results that a certain student or group of students did not perform as anticipated that a student failed an assessment event or failed to perform according to instructions and may assist the teacher to take measures for shortening the correction cycle e.g. re arranging the order or flow of activities refining pre defined conditions for alerts or for optional content allocation allocating to a student or a group of students some additional content or exercises .

Based on the knowledge map learning activities are performed block by the student utilizing the student station. Specifically the student may be exposed to exercises or drills in topics in which the student s knowledge maps shows weakness. Based on the student s performance of the additional learning activities the student s knowledge map is updated modified or re generated block to reflect modifications in the students knowledge. For example the student s knowledge map may be updated to reflect that the student is now strong in division.

Optionally one or more iterations or cycles of the operations of blocks and may be repeated arrow . The iterations may be performed during the same lesson or at the same day e.g. consecutively or across multiple days or lessons. The iterations may be performed until the updated knowledge map of the student reflects sufficient knowledge of the student in the relevant topic or subject matter e.g. until the student s actual knowledge map reaches or matches the required knowledge map or until the estimated gap or difference between the student s actual knowledge map and the required knowledge map is small or smaller than a pre defined percentage or threshold or until his personal learning curve shows a certain degree or level of progress. Optionally additional explanations or help may be provided to the student during the iterations if needed to strengthen his knowledge in the relevant topic or subject matter. The content of learning objects may be automatically modified or adapted during the iterations to accommodate the student s weaknesses and strengths as identified in his knowledge map.

The student s progress is monitored and tracked block . Optionally a student s knowledge may be further strengthened by re cycling and further drilling topics or vocabulary that the student already knows block according to his knowledge map. For example learning activities may be adaptively tailored to further exercise concepts that the student already grasped as well as to attempt to provide the student with new knowledge which the student did not yet grasp. The learning objects may be filled with content or their content may be modified according to the tracked record of progress of the student.

Other suitable operations or sets of operations may be used in accordance with embodiments of the invention. One or more of the operations may be repeated for example in multiple iterations or cycles. Operations may be performed in other suitable order.

The collaboration tool includes a teacher station associated with multiple student stations for example student stations . Students utilize the student stations to perform learning activities substantially in parallel e.g. the same learning activity or various learning activities. A save state mechanism is associated with each student station for example save state mechanisms are associated with student stations respectively. The save state mechanism allows for example to save or copy or capture or acquire a current state or snapshot of a learning activity of a student station to pause or hold a current state of a learning activity of a student station to save or copy a screen shot or snapshot or a status of a learning activity of a student station to save or copy a results report of a learning activity of a student station. The save state mechanisms may be activated substantially together e.g. the teacher station is used by the teacher to activate all the save state mechanisms or selectively e.g. the teacher station is used by the teacher to selectively activate one or more of the save state mechanisms .

For example the teacher may utilize the teacher station to selectively activate one or more of the save state mechanisms . Additionally or alternatively a student may utilize a student station e.g. student station to activate the corresponding save state mechanism . Additionally or alternatively the teaching learning system or a learning object may be programmed to activate a save state mechanism upon a triggering event or when pre defined conditions are met for example when a pre defined time period elapses since the beginning of the lesson when a pre defined time period elapses since the beginning of the operation of a learning object or a learning activity when a pre defined percentage of a learning object is successfully completed when a pre defined percentage of a learning object is incorrectly performed or the like. In some embodiments optionally a save state mechanism may be able to save multiple states e.g. corresponding to multiple time points.

A transfer mechanism is associated with each student station for example transfer mechanisms are associated with student stations respectively. The transfer mechanism is able to transfer the saved state information from the corresponding student station to the teacher station . The transfer mechanisms may be activated substantially together e.g. the teacher station is used by the teacher to activate all the transfer mechanisms or selectively e.g. the teacher station is used by the teacher to selectively activate one or more of the transfer mechanisms .

For example the teacher may utilize the teacher station to selectively activate one or more of the transfer mechanisms . Additionally or alternatively a student may utilize a student station e.g. student station to activate the corresponding transfer mechanism . Additionally or alternatively the teaching learning system or a learning object may be programmed to activate a transfer mechanism upon a triggering event or when pre defined conditions are met for example when a pre defined time period elapses since the beginning of the lesson when a pre defined time period elapses since the beginning of the operation of a learning object or a learning activity when a pre defined percentage of a learning object is successfully completed when a pre defined percentage of a learning object is incorrectly performed or the like. In some embodiments optionally a transfer mechanism may be able to transfer multiple saved states e.g. corresponding to multiple time points.

A saved state may include for example a screen shot textual component graphical components audio video animations results achievements answers correct answers incorrect answers or other information. Saves states may be received from one or more student stations for example saved states may be received from student stations respectively. The received saved states are stored and presented on the teacher station for example in a common space .

The common space may be implemented in various ways. For example in some embodiments the common space may be implemented as a global common space that virtually exists on the Internet or the World Wide Web. Such global type of common space may be associated with a view or other functions available exclusively to the teacher using the teacher station allowing the teacher to perform management and or moderation of the common space e.g. management and or moderation of content and saved states . Optionally a non managed or non moderated common space may be used in addition to or instead of the managed or moderated common space .

In other embodiments the common space may be implemented as a local common space and or a teacher station s common space which is operable substantially exclusively on the teacher station . In some embodiments students may use student stations to post or submit their work e.g. work results or work products to the common space and or to relate e.g. comment on work posted by other students. The teacher may utilize the teacher station to access such global common space optionally the teacher utilizing the teacher station may have more privileges e.g. more available functions with regard to the common space then students utilizing the student stations .

In some embodiments a global type of common space may not necessarily include all or some of the saved states that were captured and transferred to the teacher station . In some embodiments some or all of the saved states may be stored in the global common space and may not be stored on the teacher station optionally the teacher station may allow the teacher to moderate modify delete edit or otherwise manage the content of the common space.

In some embodiments a common space may be implemented locally utilizing the teacher station and the teacher may selectively share the local common space or selected portions thereof with the class for example the local common space may be selectively presented and operated as a class session common space available to the class for a limited time period and or not necessarily available globally to third parties.

A received saved state may optionally be presented on the teacher station together with an indication of the respective source of the saved state. For example saved state may be presented on the teacher station in proximity to a textual item indicating that saved state was received from student station which is currently operated by Student B.

The teacher station may include an interface to allow the teacher to selectively operate on one or more or all of the saved states . For example a select button allows a teacher to select one or more of the saved states a delete button allows a teacher to delete or remove the selected saved state s from the common space a project button allows a teacher to project the selected saved state s using a projector onto a board other interface components may be used. The projected saved state s may aid the teacher to conduct a class discussion for example comparing the projected saved states evaluating the correctness of the projected saved state s inviting comments from students about the projected saved state s or the like.

Optionally the teacher may utilize the teacher station to select a particular saved state e.g. or a particular student or of the teacher utilizing the teacher station and to define that saved state as a starting point or a continuation point for some or all of the students the learning object may thus become available for utilization by students continuing from the position of the selected saved state.

Instead of or in addition to projection of selected saved state s other information may be selected for class presentation or projection by the teacher using the teacher station . For example other items may be included in the common space or in the projected information which may be used as a sharing space for lesson materials or information which provides opportunity for class discussions or interacting between the teacher and students regarding educational content.

In some embodiments the teacher station may allow the teacher to perform various operations on the saved states or on other information in the common space for example sorting operation comparison marking the differences between items putting items side by side or in various presentation formats zooming in or zooming out on items shrinking or expanding items hiding and revealing items dividing items into groups or the like.

In some embodiments the collaboration tool may include additional functions for interactions and collaboration. For example an annotation tool may allow students to use their student stations and or may allow the teacher to use his teacher station to annotate information items to add comments to information items to tag information items to mark portions of information items or the like.

Additionally or alternatively a voting tool or a poll conducting tool may allow students to use their student stations in order to cast votes on survey questions presented by the teacher station with regard to the projected information items. For example the teacher may use the teacher station to selectively project two different saved states and onto the board . The teacher may then ask the students orally or by using the teacher station to cast their vote for the saved state which they think includes the correct answer. The students may use student stations to cast their votes electronically for example using a survey program or a poll application or interface and the votes may be collected and the results displayed using the teacher station. Other tools may be used in conjunction with the collaboration tool .

A show the answer button may present the correct answer to the student e.g. if the student does not wish to submit his suggested answer or if the student failed to correctly answer the question. Optionally a continue button may be used by the student to progress from the current question to a subsequent question.

In some embodiments the learning object may provide the student with a digital drawing board on the student station and the student may utilize the student station in order to draw paint select items drag and drop items move items rotate items delete items draw lines draw polygons draw circles enter text resize items undo actions re do actions clear the digital drawing board refresh or reload the original drawing utilize graphical items from a repository or the like. For example a learning object in the topic of geometry may present to the student a polygon and may ask the student how many diagonals can be drawn from a particular corner of the polygon. The student may utilize the student station to enter his response. Then the learning object may ask the student to draw on the digital board all the diagonals possible from that particular corner. The student may utilize the student station to draw lines representing the diagonals. Then the learning object may ask the student whether or not his estimate of the possible number of diagonals is correct in view of his actual drawing of diagonals. The student may select or enter yes or no . The learning object may thus allow interactive step by step learning. Optionally the learning object may provide the student with real time guidance and correction for example if a student attempts to draw a polygon but generates multiple lines that do not constitute a polygon the learning object may alert the student that the polygon is not completed and may advise the student how to correct his drawing.

The teaching learning system may store and utilize information regarding teachers students principals and other users of the system. The information may include for example personal information e.g. name home address contact information subject matters in which the teacher is able to teach subject matters in which the teacher actually teaches in the current year identification of classes which the teacher teaches in the current year and or taught in past years or the like. The information may reflect division of students among classes division of students among subject matter classes e.g. a math class a literature class division of students among base classes or the like. The information may be searched and or filtered and various reports may be generated based on the stored information.

Some embodiments include a system for teaching learning and assessment which includes three fully integrated modules a planning module a Real Time Class Management RTCM module and an integrated tracking and assessment module. The planning module allows planning presenting editing and preparing items for delivery to a class of students the items including for example integrated teaching learning assessment plans having flow and content components. The deliverable items may correspond to an entire yearly curricular program for each subject matter. The planning may include selecting learning objects and or learning activities and arranging them in accordance with a teacher s preferred order optionally allowing differential and or pre defined and or conditional order layout and allocation of content and or activities to different students or groups of students. The system allows the teacher to define and to dynamically modify order of subjects study units and lessons flow of activities and learning objects including content alternatives e.g. pre conditioned or manually selected or automated based on allocation rules groups of students assessment rules and rubrics.

In some embodiments a student may belong to more than one group e.g. for various purposes. For example a student may belong to Group A including advanced level students with respect to math and to Group B including students that require assistance with respect to literature. Additionally or alternatively a student may belong to Group A with regard to multiplication in math and may belong to Group B with regard to division in math. Other suitable parameters may be used to classify students into one or more groups.

The RTCM module allows the teacher to present content and make content available to students e.g. by selectively locking unlocking or enabling disabling content items on their student stations to modify the pre planed flow of a lesson e.g. by re ordering learning activities or by modifying allocation of content to groups to monitor students activities to control students activity in class and to assign activities for homework to control computers and peripheral equipment e.g. teaching accessories or learning accessories in the classroom to manage and moderate a common space and its display area and to include order or edit students work to selectively project it and or make it available to students for comments.

The integrated tracking and assessment module allows monitoring of substantially all teaching learning assessment activities of the users e.g. teachers and students assessing them and reporting the results to authorized users e.g. teachers principal . The integrated tracking and assessment module allows for example definition and arrangement of practice assignments and tests based on sets of exercises and questions publishing and allocating the tests or assignments including definitions of differential allocation and or differential behavior of items e.g. different time to accomplish different weight of question scoring checking assessing and or grading the assignments performed by students reporting the results to users according to their rights permissions and storing a full record of the activity and scores.

The integrated tracking and assessment module performs tracking e.g. a recording process of most or substantially all of the students interactions with learning objects. These interactions are monitored and tracked during in class activities and or homework and are stored for example in the students personal portfolio or folder. Accordingly the integrated tracking and assessment module may apply various rules or criteria for assessment and may not be limited to determining whether correct answers are provided e.g. during tests and formal exercises .

For example the integrated tracking and assessment module may determine the number of wrong choices during preliminary phases of an activity the number of times the student asked for help using the relevant buttons e.g. help hint example need assistance or the like the rate of assignments that were submitted on schedule namely within the time period allocated for submission and not after a pre defined deadline the level of cooperation that the student exhibits while performing collaborative assignments or other parameters.

The integrated tracking and assessment module allows for assessment and reporting of teachers professional progress based on the tracking of his planning activities real time class performance and his students success achievement and or the changes in the personal and group learning curves or knowledge maps . Some embodiment of the system also allows for assessment and reporting of a teacher a group of teachers or an entire school performance based on all mentioned above .

In some embodiments the system may include multiple components for example three components a RTCM component which includes multiple functions and tools for management of in class teaching and learning in substantially real time a planning component which includes multiple functions and tools for planning in the macro level and in the micro level lessons assignments learning activities learning itineraries and teaching itineraries and an integrated assessment component which performs substantially ongoing assessment of student performance as an integrated part of the teaching learning process wherein the ongoing assessment results further affect and modify the teaching and learning processes.

In some embodiments the teaching learning system may allow the teacher to utilize the teacher station to divide the students into multiple groups taking into account one or more dimensions or parameters and to allocate to different groups different learning objects different learning activities different lesson plans or different learning scenarios. The RTCM component may allow the teacher utilizing the teacher station to dynamically modify the allocation of learning objects or learning activities to students or groups in substantially real time in class. For example the teacher station may be used by the teacher to lock or disable a particular learning object from being performed by students to whom it was previously allocated to modify the order in which previously allocated learning objects are performed or to perform other modifications optionally using a drag and drop interface a scripting language and or a scripting interface to allow creation and modification of lesson plans and learning activities.

In some embodiments the teaching learning system may allow the teacher to utilize the teacher station to selectively or gradually introduce or serve to different students utilizing student stations or to different student groups one or more learning objects learning activities lesson plans or learning scenarios based on one or more conditions or criteria. For example learning objects or learning activities may be exposed or served to different students based on gradual exposure based on substantially complete exposure based on conditioned exposure e.g. completion of a first learning object by Student A is a condition for exposing a second learning object to Student A or successful completion of a first learning object by a minimum percentage of students in the class or in a group is a condition for exposing a second learning object or the like or other exposure schemes.

In some embodiments the teacher station may be used by the teacher to control and or modify operational parameters or operational status of one or more teaching units or other teaching equipment. For example the teacher may utilize the teacher station to selectively turn on or turn off the projector and or the board connected to the teacher station to temporarily darken or pause or stop the projection so that the students attention is directed to the teacher and not to the projection to project a message instructing the students to direct their attention to the teacher or to the board and to selectively enable or disable the connection of one or more students stations or substantially all the students stations to the Internet. Optionally the teacher station may show textual indications and or graphical indications of the operational status of one or more teaching units e.g. the projector the board the Internet connection or the like . Optionally the pre planned lesson plan may include commands to automatically control the operation of such teaching units during the lesson e.g. when a triggering event occurs when pre defined conditions are met when a threshold percentage of students completed a learning activity or the like.

In some embodiments the teaching learning system is able to generate and to dynamically update a knowledge map per student which may be used as an evaluation tool to evaluate the achievements and the performance of that student. Optionally the knowledge map may be presented using textual descriptions e.g. the student is strong in math and weak in literature having various levels of resolution or detailing e.g. the student is very strong in multiplication and relatively weak in division . The knowledge map may optionally include color representations e.g. marking in green color a topic in which the student is strong and marking in red color a topic in which the student is weak . The knowledge map may optionally include graphical representations e.g. charts pie charts graphs or the like. The knowledge map of a student may use textual and or graphical indications to represent for example the actual or estimate knowledge map of the student the required or expected knowledge map and the gap or difference between the two. The knowledge map may be used instead of or in addition to other evaluation metrics or evaluation articles for example a report card a listing of grades a transcript or the like. The dynamically updated knowledge map may be used for self assessment of the student by himself for parental supervision and assessment for pedagogic supervision and assessment or the like.

In some embodiments a base line curricular knowledge map is generated and is optionally regarded as a set of pre defined rubrics or requirements of the curriculum or the lesson plan . Students knowledge maps may be evaluated with reference to the base line curricular knowledge map thereby allowing assessment of how a student accomplished the requirements set by the curriculum.

In some embodiments the teaching learning system is able to generate and to dynamically update a knowledge map of a student and to generate and update dynamically multiple knowledge maps of multiple students respectively. The multiple knowledge maps of multiple students may be used by the teaching learning system for further analysis research and or data mining tasks. The teaching learning system may analyze multiple knowledge maps of multiple students and use the aggregated information in order to generate output for example an evaluation of a teacher based on the knowledge maps of the students associated with that teacher an evaluation of a teacher based on the knowledge gaps e.g. between the actual knowledge map of a student and the required or expected knowledge map of the students associated with that teacher an evaluation of a school or of multiple schools or of an education system based on an analysis of aggregated knowledge maps of multiple students e.g. substantially all students representative students pseudo randomly selected students or the like or the like.

In some embodiments the knowledge maps of multiple students may be used by the teaching learning system to compare or evaluate particular operations performed by a teacher particular decisions taken by a teacher particular teaching styles or the like. For example a first group of students may be associated with a first teacher that utilizes lesson plans and or learning objects and or learning activities that are pre provided by the teaching learning system substantially exclusively without modification or personalization by the first teacher. In contrast a second group of students may be associated with a second teacher that utilizes modified lesson plans and or modified learning objects and or modified learning activities e.g. modified by the second teacher . Furthermore a third group of students may be associated with a third teacher that utilizes newly generated lesson plans and or newly generated learning objects and or newly generated learning activities e.g. newly generated by the third teacher using a generation wizard or other generation tools . The teaching learning system may aggregate and analyze knowledge maps of students from the first group the second group and the third group and may provide output comparison results and relative success of each teacher the first teacher that uses pre provided educational content the second teacher that uses modified educational content and the third teacher that uses newly generated educational content. Other analysis or comparisons may be performed.

In some embodiments a process of techno pedagogic cracking or solving is performed in order to create relation and correlation between ICT advantages and pedagogic goals e.g. as set for knowledge skills and competencies in the curriculum . The techno pedagogic cracking process determines the best way the optimal way a near optimal way a suggested optimal way or an estimated optimal way to teach learn and assess a certain topic issue skill and or competency with the aid of ICT. In some embodiments cracking of pedagogic approaches and processes is performed in various learning processes or disciplines for example at the primary or elementary school e.g. first language studies second learning studies mathematics or the like .

The techno pedagogic solutions cracks are all field tested followed by research and evaluation pedagogic teams and provide proven paths for teaching learning and assessment. The teaching learning system offers content methodology conditions and tools which are incorporated in the teaching learning environment and relevant parts are incorporated in the teachers and students workstations that provide the advantages of ICT to the pedagogic science and profession. These allow the teacher to carry out his job e.g. managing and guiding a learning process utilizing the benefits of Information and Communication Technology ICT and using the computer in the classroom and or at home.

The teaching learning system provides to the teacher a variety of learning objects that fulfill different goals in the processes of teaching learning and assessment a set of editing and authoring tools that allow creating editing modifying and adapting e.g. changing predefined content and or behavior of learning objects and allow their incorporation into teaching learning and assessment processes an assortment of pedagogic models where learning objects are arranged into predefined tested and proven paths of teaching learning and assessment a teaching management and planning environment that allows for editing modifying and adapting of the predefined pedagogic models according to class or students needs allowing replacing adding deleting modifying re sequencing and re ordering of learning objects a real time class management environment that allows activation or playback of a predefined or modified or edited flow of learning objects e.g. according to a pedagogic model as well as allocating of learning objects to a class or a group of individual students and optionally locking freezing or temporarily disabling and unlocking unfreezing or enabling learning objects and a dynamic optionally case sensitive e.g. adapted to provide case by case relevant input set of help files instructions and pedagogic recommendations for the use of both the learning object s and the pedagogic models.

Some embodiments provide a modeling language pedagogic scripting and or techno pedagogic scripting or modeling. For example an Educational Modeling Language EML allows managers of instruction or of pedagogic processes to define a path for of computer based pedagogic activities and their relevant content. It further allows defining computerized management of differential and adaptive learning for example using a set of pedagogic terms that the system recognizes and arranging them in a way the system is able to understand and act upon.

In some embodiments a simple sequencing script is used for example utilizing a script file that includes the sequence of the learning objects to be presented or activated. The script is able to call learning objects from the repository onto the screen of a computer in a predefined order. Having more than one alternative of sequence scripts for a given learning process or topic or set of skills allows production of differential learning processes for different groups or students according to needs of the users as estimated or predicted by the sequence planner.

In some embodiments a more complicated format is used for example a branched and conditional sequencing script. The script may modify the path of learning e.g. the sequence or the educational content elements that are presented or activated according to the context or according to a students behavior or interaction with the educational content. For example built in algorithms may assess or evaluate judge the students interaction with the educational content and may modify the sequence or content elements in the script according to a pre defined set of options or alternatives thereby providing the student with an adaptive fit to his needs. The assessment or evaluation judgment of students interactions by the system is based on predicted patterns of behavior on sorting and discernment of student answers and on algorithms set in the system.

In some embodiments a script may further modify or edit the content elements within a learning activity or learning object e.g. on the fly or in real time. For example the script may call for a content presenter e.g. a component that displays the content on the screen then calls for a template e.g. that defines order placement of multimedia elements and behavior instructions to interactive elements then calls for the multimedia elements and the textual elements involved and presents all of them on the screen as an interactive learning object.

In some embodiments the system may use a combination of script types to allow the teacher to prepare or allocate for each group or student an assortment of different content elements with differentiality in substantially all the aspects of the interactive learning object e.g. the look and feel of skins and navigation controls the use of multimedia elements or textual elements the choice of words or level or register of a language changes in conditional behavior changes in assessment rubrics or information elements or the like thereby providing the student with an adaptive fit to his needs as well as content and behavior that fit his learning style his disabilities if any his talents or the like.

In some embodiments the teacher or the learning path planner may edit the script and create a learning flow or scenario. The teacher may drag and drop learning objects into the class or group or student designated learning path and may create a preferred sequence for each. The teacher may use an editing tool e.g. implemented as a subset of the differential assigning of content and activities module of which utilizes the EML that is based on pedagogic terms that the teaching learning system recognizes and arrange them in a way that allows the system to understand and act upon them using a learning script editor.

The learning script editor may display the results of the editing process by the teacher in an interactive way in a what you see is what you get WYSIWYG manner and may allow the teacher for example to select learning objects from the repository to set the initial conditions or order in which they are allocated or offered to a student to set alternative learning objects and the conditions and or context and or circumstances and or parameters that will incorporate or activate them in the learning path to rearrange the look feel and content of the learning objects to set alternative look feel and content of any of the selected learning objects to evaluate or assess his decisions in real time to make corrections of his editing and to place the edited scenario in the teaching learning and assessment plan and or allocate it to individual students groups or the entire class.

Some embodiments include a factory or process for generating educational content including tools for mass production of pre prepared digital educational content items and tools for mass production of educational content by users e.g. teachers . The tools include templates supporting multiple aspects e.g. visual and behavioral or functional . The factory or process may define and utilize standardization to achieve usability and re usability of created or modified digital educational content.

A template includes a standardized form that defines creation aspects of a certain type of content elements namely learning objects in more than one instance or example for example creation aspects of the same type of content element with the same behavior of functions but with different content or multimedia assets from instance to instance.

Content is created or built in small elements educational content atoms that can be rapidly and conveniently arranged into bigger portions or chunks of content educational content molecule . All template elements and multimedia assets are designed and manufactured according to template definitions and system standards and or style guides thereby allowing improved re utilization and combining of elements or assets into learning objects.

A template further sets the standards for creating or developing all the components assets involved in a type of learning object for example standards for sizes color schemes style guides predicted behavior outcome or result of student interaction with them or the like. This standardization allows better re usability of the assets as well as integrating multimedia assets developed once into many examples or instances of the template or learning object and allows the integration of more than one atomic educational content item into a chain or a complex learning object educational content molecule .

Content elements are placed in a content repository a content management system and or a content library. Each content element is tagged with comprehensive metadata that describes its features settings parameters and possible relations with other content elements and with the learning flow. The content management system automatically determines where each element or multimedia asset is placed and into which template it may fit or into which presenter or container it may be called and be displayed or activated.

Some content objects may be pre fabricated such that elements are combined together into a playable file or script or incorporated into a common container that is regarded by the teaching learning system as a unique item or a black box . Other content objects may be dynamically built on the fly or in real time for example a file containing a script may call for a content presenter may call a template may call all multimedia elements assets may call the texts involved and may display them on the screen when needed or called for.

With regard to pre fabricated learning objects an editor allows the arrangement or re arrangement of all parts or components of the learning object e.g. skins navigation elements multimedia assets as well as insertion of text where needed. The editor creates a container that includes a script file e.g. using XML that defines the context for which the learning object is relevant lists all elements that are included in a current instance of the learning object defines the conditions for calling the learning object to the students station set rubrics and or parameters for assessment and the actions that the system takes with respect to the interaction of the student with the learning object.

With regard to dynamically generated learning objects a learning script editor is used e.g. as described herein with reference to techno pedagogic scripting . This allows creating an instructions file e.g. a script that describes the learning scenario offered for the current activity which notifies the learning management system about all relevant components e.g. template assets etc. to be called for at any time.

These editors may be implemented as teacher s tools allowing teachers to access and or create educational content based on system templates and multimedia assets and to set or modify their behavior and functionality according to system rules e.g. the modeling language . Products generated by these editors may be incorporated into the teaching learning and assessment plan of the teacher for his class and may be activated in the process at the teacher s request or at predefined conditions or context.

Some embodiments allow publishing of generated or modified educational content for example by a first teacher to other teachers. Content publishing may be un moderated or may be controlled and moderated by a supervisor. In some embodiments a learning object created by a teacher or modified by a teacher may be published or otherwise shared with other teachers and or with the teaching learning system and may thus become re usable in other teaching learning scenarios and instances. Accordingly the product generated by a teacher who creates or modifies a learning object optionally using editor tools step by step wizard tools or the like may thus become part of the teaching learning system and may be used by that teacher or by other teacher in subsequent teaching learning sessions.

Optionally a digital learning object created or modified by a teacher may include or may be associated with rules or scripts for dynamic adaptation or dynamic modification thereof. Optionally a digital learning object may include self awareness rules or self modification rules which may dynamically modify the content of the digital learning object in real time in response to dynamic properties of the teaching learning environment. In some embodiments for example a digital learning object may be adapted to automatically use a first set of vocabulary items when executed by a first grade student or by a weak student and to automatically use a second different set of vocabulary items when executed by a third grade student or by an advanced student. In some embodiments for example a digital learning object may be pre programmed to switch from a first set of vocabulary items to a second set of vocabulary items based on the ongoing performance of that digital learning object by a student. In some embodiments a digital learning object may be associated with various other rules that adaptively and or differentially modify the digital learning object or modify or replace the assets used therein e.g. vocabulary numbers images or the like based on identity and properties of the student executing the digital learning object based on past performance or current performance of the digital learning object by the student based on external or environmental properties e.g. extending the time or shortening the time allocated for completing the digital learning object in response to an increase or decrease in the time allocated for the lesson or other self modification rules.

In some embodiments the system utilizes voice recognition and or speech recognition for example as a mechanism allowing the teacher to provide input to provide commands to perform RTCM operations or the like. For example the teacher station may utilize a voice recognition mechanism including hardware components e.g. a microphone and software components e.g. a software module that recognizes speech . The teacher station may be trained or adapted to selectively recognize the teacher s voice and to selectively execute commands conveyed orally by the teacher and to ignore disregard or not execute oral input or commands provided by students or other parties. For example the teacher station may be adapted to recognize the phrase projector on when said or pronounced by the teacher and to turn on the projector in response to recognize the phrase projector off when said by the teacher and to turn off the projector in response to recognize the phrase please look at me when said by the teacher and in response to project and or send to all students stations a message please look at the teacher or other suitable commands. Speech recognition may be used by the teacher to perform RTCM operations or to dynamically modify in real time learning objects and or lesson plans for example the teacher station may recognize the phrase lock the third learning object when said by the teacher and in response may lock or freeze or disable the third learning object scheduled for utilization in the current lesson. Other suitable operations may be triggered using voice recognition and or speech recognition in addition to or instead of other types of input mechanisms e.g. using a mouse a keyboard or the like .

The present invention may provide an Educational Adaptive Engine development environment for Data Driven Teaching as infrastructure and modules supported by building blocks digital objects and files components and interfaces allowing developing configuring and executing modular and flexible adaptive teaching learning mechanisms as well as the accompanying digital content needed for their execution. The system may utilize two interconnected or separate platforms the Teach Platform and the Create Platform which may be able to communicate with each other by utilizing pre defined taxonomy of educational definitions and or a set of parameters operators in a manner that that requires content creation and or content utilization e.g. including the configuration or real time modification of content without programing knowledge. The system may allow a computerized process which takes the teacher and the student from a conventional textbook to innovative Electronic Course eCourse teaching and learning environment.

The Teach Platform may comprise or may provide for example a Access to content repository of digital objects and for teachers choice according to student s needs such as eBooks predefined courses banks of interactions and allowing ongoing lesson planning and lesson modification according to actual results. b Display of class group students profiles including level and progress status displayed to the teacher s with an intuitive UI that allows auto grouping and re grouping of students according to their accomplishment subject to manual teacher s override The system may identify the level of a student based on his accomplishment s during interactions and assessment thus keeping a continuously updated student knowledge map. The system may also align all interactions with educational requirement such as state or common core standards. As the system holds and updates such information for the entire class or for groups of students the system may recommend assignment or division or allocation of the students into groups and dynamic real time re allocation or re grouping based on dynamically monitored accomplishments of individual students such that all students in a group are of the same or sufficiently close accomplishment level. The boundaries of a group high and low marks for the students to be included in the group may be pre set and locked by schools administration or may be left to the teacher s decision for dynamic modification. The teacher may choose to allow this process to be governed automatically by the system or to allow the system to operate in recommend mode in which the system recommends actions that the teacher may accept or reject or which may be automatically accepted unless the teacher over rides within a pre defined time period . In the recommend mode the system may alert the teacher about changes in student s accomplishment for individual student s or for groups of students. This may be a note in end of lesson summary report or a real time alert in the real time progress dashboard or a special notice if and when the system realizes such recommendation is appropriate e.g. student or students are currently performing below or above their set level. Once the teacher gets such recommendation the teacher may choose to use the re grouping interface and move e.g. via drag and drop students from one group to another group. A special case may be handled at the beginning of the school year as the system has no data or little data for initial grouping and a Placement Level Test may be performed and the system may assign or recommend group placement for all participating students and optionally the system may utilize historical data from a previous year with regard to one or more students. c Content allocation for different groups of students and or individual students for example allowing to serve them different educational content and different interactions e.g. at different complexity or level different scaffolding and support features e.g. help hints tips highlight and comments number of allowed trials d Adaptive generic engine for different adaptive learning implementations which may optionally rely on content taxonomy and may be aligned with educational requirements e.g. state standards e Monitoring module via real time progress dashboard end of lesson report periodical reports allowing effective formative assessment e.g. real time performance feedback and continuous quality improvement in a virtual teaching learning cycle f Real Time teaching and class management features supporting messaging spot check polling ensuring that all students are on the same page allowing a student to raise his hand to answer or to pose a question by operating his computer station and or other suitable features.

The Create Platform may comprise an educational applications generation environment featuring a Pre defined pedagogically designed interactions editing tools and templates b Design and layout features at the user interface level not requiring additional programming with the ability to choose between Dynamic Layout multi platform multi resolution automatic layout or Dynamic Layout Bypass c Ability to keep original PDF design by adding hotspots to open the interactions or ability to view the original PDF in the player while performing the interactions the CGS has the ability to convert PDF files into HTML5 while keeping the original layout book view . Interactions may be linked to selected places in the book view page. This may be done by specifying a link on text or picture or part s of picture e.g. by marking a specific mark on the picture and defining it to act as a hot spot that activates a link to the activity when clicked upon d Standalone player for running content on other platforms e.g. LMS or to wrap the content in a generic or integrated or flexible player that allows the content to be played on other platforms and or through other devices as a stand alone application or a native application. e Workflow management e Content reuse e.g. maintain one instance of content and re use it with modifications and or other suitable features.

The combination of Teach and Create platforms allows realization of various pedagogic approaches to facilitate and achieve the end goal of Improved Students Achievement teaching and learning in a variety of IT settings one to one one to class class and home gathering data from students interactions during learning activities executing different adaptive concepts and related teaching methodologies pave a differential personal learning path based students performance interact or integrate with a variety of third party tools to enhance school class student and lessons management Content differential update such that a new update affects only content of lessons that were not used. The digital educational content may be updated easily and efficiently and this is of great value to content creator publisher and authorities but typically the content creator or publisher loses any knowledge about the digital content once it was published and released or distributed such as content that was used by a class presented or assigned to the students and then interacted with should not be changed or updated as an update will usually replace the interacted content and the data on student accomplishment may be lost. If content that was used by student is changed or updated it may become different in his lessons history relative to what he experienced during class causing possible confusion. The system may thus identify already used content if an update is issued and content is replaced in the content repository library it would be available for new use in the updated form but it will not over write those lessons that were already used by teacher and students in class.

A Rule Engine controls the flow of the learning path. The rule engine may be built by utilizing a programming language composed of set s of API s to read user previous performance attributes current performance attribute and API that controls the path of the application the learning path implemented by routing the user to the Next learning activity .

A user performance mapping module may create and utilize a data structure representing previous predeceasing performance data this data structure is a dynamic data structure allowing the implementer to store predeceasing information for user learning activities. The structure complexity depends on the adaptive learning methodology may vary from a simple list of attributes to complex structures .

The set of learning activities may be a bank of digital learning objects e.g. files mini programs scripts created by the content developer s and tagged with specific attributes to identify the learning activity difficulty and other parameters.

Various approaches may be realized to achieve different adaptive concepts to facilitate personal learning path based on learning activities. The teacher may control the rules through the teacher controlled Adaptive Model Rules Interface and may selectively assign a different adaptive concept to groups or individuals.

The Technical Actions Flow module allows a teacher to assign different adaptive concepts to multiple e.g. three groups in the class Bellow level students on level students and above level students.

In the lessons planning phase the teacher accesses the planning section in the DTP and activates the teacher controlled Adaptive Model Rules Interface. The teacher may change the parameters of the rules according to the desired adaptive learning concept method a For below level students defines that all help hints and examples are active and the student is assigned at least 10 repetitions of the activity with different data b For on level students defines that only help and hints are active and only after wrong answer the student is assigned only 7 repetitions of the activity with different data and only if he scores below 50 he will be assigned another set of seven c For above level students defines that no help or hints are active the student is assigned only 4 repetitions of the activity if he scores below 50 he will be assigned only another set of 4 if he scores above 75 he will be assigned extra reading and a problem solving assignment.

In another implementation all three groups are assigned to a placement test. Their accomplishments in the placement test are used for setting the adaptive rules for them Students that accomplish poorly in spelling will be assigned more interaction that requires spelling of words. Students that had many mistakes in grammar will be assigned more interaction that strengthens their mastering of grammatical rules. Students that their performance indicated problems in understanding will receive more reading passages accompanied with a lot of scaffolding tools if needed.

In another implementation on level and above level groups of students are assigned to adaptive rules while bellow level students are not and rather the below level students are addressed by the teacher and treated separately according teachers understanding.

During class each group of student receives on the screen the starting point content element first LO that is assigned to students of the group and the adaptive engine controls the flow and assignment of the next content elements second LO third LO and so forth according to the rules set for the group.

In a first example Student A who is bellow level and student B who is on level will both receive identical first and second LOs. These LOs include interactions questions that the way the students answers them indicates his level of understanding and ability to accomplish the task at hand. Student A performs badly which is an indication that he belongs to the bellow level set of rules so from the third LO onwards he will receive all interactions with help hints and examples. This will be the case with the ten or other number of the following digital Los and if the system realizes that he is answering correct answers without accessing the help and hint scaffolding tools then the following digital LOs will again be presented without scaffolding tools. Student B who performed better on the two initial digital LOs will continue to receive LOs with no help or hint. If he performs properly this will be the case for seven or other number of repetitions but if he provides wrong answers then the system may offer him to try again and expose the help and or hint options. If the help hint indeed helped and the student answers properly in most cases then he will continue to the next step and again will start with no help or hint exposed but if he scores below a certain threshold e.g. below 50 then he will be assigned another set of 7 interactions of the same kind.

The present invention may provide a Course Browser utilizing Dynamic Layout DL . Courses or LOs may run on various devices e.g. desktop computer laptop computer tablet smartphone interactive board eBook reader multimedia player with different screen size and or screen resolution and with different operating systems. The Course Browser adapts the pedagogical content to provide the best display on the relevant device. The Course Browser takes into account several factors by a machine or human when solving the best content layout on the screen or other display peripherals. Such factors may include for example a Mission factor or Mission of the pedagogical activity namely the pedagogical content requirements for the specific activity such as goals activity characteristics and the information presented to the user b Environment factor representing constraints for the content layout solution related to environmental factors such as user profile age special needs and physical conditions e.g. lighting conditions measured ambient lighting estimated user distance from the screen particularly if the screen comprises or is associated with a projector or a smart board and optionally utilizing a camera or imager located in proximity to the screen the camera or imager able to capture an image of the classroom or to capture a field of view the camera associated with measurement logic or estimation logic to estimate distance of one or more students from the screen based on size or relative size of image components or based on other suitable parameters the system will change font type and or font size if needed as well as image size the system may maintain pedagogic priority and therefore resize or hide or replace with thumb nail the less important content elements from pedagogic point of view while trying to keep the more important parts unchanged or less changed . c Device factor representing constraints for the content layout solution related to the device in use such as display size resolution color depth quality input peripheral mouse keyboard touch screen multi touch screen stylus .

In some embodiments a Mission of a digital educational activity or LO may take into account goal s intended to be achieved concept s intended to be conveyed and learned information intended to be conveyed and learned one or more tasks that need to be completed or performed e.g. actual on screen operations or pedagogical tasks one or more characteristics of the activity e.g. is it text based or graphics based is it audio based or silent is it timed or non timed and or other suitable parameters.

The Technical Actions Flow may include the publisher content creator uses the Create Platform or engine or CGS platform to define pedagogic rules that will guide the content browser s layout and behavior when played on different devices. The DL engine determines the purpose and or the context of the elements that it needs to re arrange the basic component for the layout is a Task and since the task is modeled to different elements such as question answer bank of results then the DL may apply pre defined logic to the whole task to keep the pedagogical rational and not only a graphical basic lay outing process like a web browser may do. Some embodiments may perform DL of visual elements of a digital educational learning object based on or by taking into account for example pedagogic requirements pedagogic constraints pedagogic standards pedagogic importance or significance of visual elements priority order of pedagogic requirements or constraints standards or guidelines for accessibility for disabled persons or for students with special needs or the like.

When creating content the publisher uses a Pedagogical Constrains Setting Interface to apply desired pedagogical constraints for the course content for example no scroll per task no text reduction no image reduction image must be shown together with the text of the question side by side or one above the other image may be replaced by thumb nail that will launch a floating image window all elements except for the interactive applet can be resized no element can be resized except for a given list of elements which can be hidden and replaced with icons or thumb nails that will un hide them when clicked question and answers must be shown all the time while accompanying elements such as explanatory drawing may be hidden un hidden or activated in a floating window.

The Content Editor creates course content e.g. feeding text images and other content elements . When the content is played in the Create Platform s preview module or in the Teach Platform playback module the Content Browser automatically and dynamically determines or generate or modifies the layout of publisher s content based on Device type given and or available on screen real estate e.g. available screen size in pixels the view port of an electronic device layout rules which may be general for a group of content items and or may be specific for a student or a group of student and or may be specific for a particular date or time or location content characteristics e.g. type amount the publisher s predefined pedagogical constraints.

In a first example the dynamic layout module of the Teach Platform may present the same LO in two different manners for a laptop computer having a generally horizontal screen or Landscape type display and for a tablet having a generally vertical screen or a Portrait type display. For example in a landscape type display unit the Teach Platform may arrange side by side internal components of a particular LO e.g. a graph chart side by side with a yes no question or a multiple choice question whereas in a portrait type display unit the Teach Platform may arrange such internal components of the LO one on top of the other e.g. a graph chart on top of the yes no question or the multiple choice question . Optionally the font size may automatically adjusted and or graphic elements may be automatically resized in order to accommodate a particular display type or size.

In a second example for dynamic layout a list of four graphical items A may be presented as a horizontal list of four graphical items side by side on a first device having sufficient landscape type display e.g. a laptop computer having screen ratio of 16 9 and B may be automatically adjusted to be displayed as a vertical list of four graphical items one on top of the other on a second device having narrow horizontal space or having portrait type display e.g. a smartphone held in portrait mode and C may be automatically adjusted to be displayed as a matrix of two by two graphic elements on a third device having medium level of horizontal display capacity e.g. a laptop computer having screen ratio of 4 3 or a tablet held in landscape mode or a smartphone held in landscape mode .

In another example if there is insufficient on screen real estate for all the four graphical items on the screen when their aspect ratio is maintained then the DL engine may determine to show one item in original size while the other three items are reduced to thumb nails when a one of the reduced three is clicked the full size item is reduced to thumb nail and the clicked item is shown in full size thereby allowing efficient utilization of limited on screen real estate to interactively present multiple elements by taking into account a small or limited form factor.

The platforms of the systems may include a Stop Line module enabling a teacher to control and to plan in advance how far the students or all students in class or a group of students or an individual student would be authorized to progress in the educational content items for a specific lesson and or for a specific course. The stop line may be dynamically adjusted during the lesson by the teacher. By using the Technical Actions Flow in the planning phase the teacher indicates the last activity or interaction or LO that the students or some of them get access to and may assign or define different Stop Line to different students or to different groups of students. In class when the student reaches the last activity interaction that the teacher set for him or for his group an indication will pop up on the student s station telling the student that he completed his task s for the current time point and that he cannot continue to further tasks and or that he should approach the teacher or communicate with the teacher electronically or otherwise. The teacher may dynamically adjust the Stop Line for the class a specific group or individual.

In some implementations once student A reaches his Stop Line the teacher station may automatically generate a notification to the teacher about this event and may query the teacher whether the teacher would like to extend the Stop Line by one or more activities or by a pre defined number of learning activities e.g. towards a secondary Stop Line which may be pre defined by the teacher . In some implementations the teacher may define in advance a primary Stop Line and a secondary Stop Line that the system would utilize automatically as a default extension once the student reached the primary Stop Line and provided that the teacher did not intervene e.g. within 15 or 30 seconds of receiving a notification of this event by commanding not to extend the primary Stop Line.

In another example the teacher may use the Stop Line feature for controlling pre lesson reading or pre lesson practice activities. For example the teacher wants the student s to read a certain passage and prepare for a class discussion and the teacher wants them to read up to a certain point only as the rest of the passage comes up with solutions or conclusions which will may harm or prevent an open discussion . Therefore the Stop Line is placed by the teacher at the desired point preventing any further reading of the content at student stations. A Stop Line may be conditional such that if a student scores above a predefined threshold then he will be stopped at a certain point while another student that scored below the threshold would be stopped at another point allowing such students to selectively be authorized to read or view less content or more content according to the case the nature of the text or the level of interactions . Other suitable mechanisms may be used.

Some embodiments may utilize a Follow the Teacher module enabling the teacher to force all students or a group of students in class to be on the same page place as the teacher wants them to be within a sequence of multiple LOs or digital activities in order to explain a specific matter even if the student is currently working individually and or a synchronously on another task via his student station. The content publisher may create or define lessons or tasks which should be displayed and or performed during a Follow the Teacher mode of synchronous teaching learning. In the content authoring phase the content creator may set an entire lesson or a specific set of activities to be displayed and or performed e.g. by all students or by a group of students in Follow the Teacher mode. If set for this mode then the content on students devices will advance only if and when the teacher activates it for re advancing or for reverting back to the content that each student was consuming or performing prior to the Follow the Teacher mode e.g. which may be saved temporarily using a Save State module . In the planning phase the teacher may indicate that an entire lesson or a specific set of activities would be displayed or performed in Follow the Teacher mode. In Class content chosen by the teacher for Follow the Teacher mode will be exposed on the students devices only if and when the teacher activates the Follow the Teacher mode from the teacher s station for the entire class or for a subset or group of students e.g. optionally allowing one or more students such as advanced students to continue working on their current tasks optionally utilizing their headphones for audio .

Some embodiments may utilize an Eyes to the Teacher module allowing the teacher to command through the teacher s station that a all the student stations or a subset or group thereof would freeze or pause the current activity of each student and or b all the student stations or a subset or group thereof would block students from further interacting e.g. by causing all input units keyboards mouse devices touch screens to become non responsive and or c all the student stations or a subset or group thereof would display a teacher defined message or notification such as Please pause your current work and turn your eyes to the teacher . In such mode the system may Save State of each student station and may Resume that state once the teacher subsequently de activates or terminates the Eyes to the Teacher mode. In some embodiments the Eyes to the Teacher mode may be selectively activated by the teacher for example selectively towards a student or a group of students that the teacher would like to freeze their current on screen interactions e.g. a disobedient student or a noisy student that the teacher wants to talk to while the student s station is paused remotely per the teacher s command .

The Create Platform may include an educational application generation environment or suit of modules an authoring suit that allows the creation of Educational Interactive Applications without the need for programming skills. The Create Authoring Environment allows authoring and publishing of digital interactive content using a General Purpose Educational Interactions Bank a set of educational computerized pedagogical interactions authoring tools that are covering most of the pedagogical needs serving to develop computerized educational content and or b Educational Applications Applets small applications that are designed to convey a pedagogical concept e.g. probability number line text analysis . The Create environment provides the set of tool to generate such applets. The end product s comprising interactive elements Educational Interactions and Applets are then combined into lessons and courses to be published as a Teach lesson or as Educational Applications. The Create Toolbox offers all that is needed for the generation of General Purpose Educational Interactions and Educational Applications Applets and may optionally utilize eWidgets Applet Templates and or Applet APIs a set of pre defined concepts structures interfaces and building blocks that allow the creation without programming skills of educational computerized components eWidgets that can become the foundation of an applet and later on be plugged in into educational application s . Multiple atomic digital LOs may be combined or assembled in advance and or dynamically in real time into a molecular digital LO utilizing a controller element which manages or controls their sequence or their conditional playback e.g. if student performed Atomic LO successfully then proceed to another atomic LO otherwise proceed to a third atomic LO . This may be applied to generating applets authoring of smart educational applets may be based on more than one eWidget combined together with a controlling component of logic that governs the relations and or conditioning and or sequencing between the widgets. For example to create a Live Text applet the creator may utilize a an eWidget of text display with capability to highlight text elements b another eWidget that may include lists of text rules or components one displaying tenses past present present progressive future another displaying the parts of speech c combining these two with a relations logic eWidget to create an applet of Live Text that highlights sentences in the text according to the choice in the text components lists d an API eWidget may allow integration of the Applet into a learning interaction that makes use of the applet and General Purpose Educational Interactions such as questions that in order to answer them the student may need to operate the Live Text applet. The applet in turn may be loaded with text passages and perform live text highlighting as an assistive tool for study of grammatical text elements while the General Purpose Educational Interactions are loaded with specific questions that relate to the text passages and to the highlighted parts of speech. Other eWidgets may be construction elements or building blocks for mathematical applets e.g. relation between elements mathematic and graphic presentations of functions science or technology applets e.g. changing an experiment results by controlling conditions or parameters or the like. The Controlling or managerial eWidget element may provide API features allowing interaction and data exchange between General Purpose Educational Interactions and Applets that were generated based on these eWidgets as well as interchanging of data and commands with the Teach DTP platform. These eWidget allow the system to Save State as well as Teacher Controls such as Stop Line Follow the teacher Eyes to the teacher updates to teacher s dash board in real time and storage of students scores or progress data for analysis and reporting.

The Create Publishing Environment allows publishing of educational interactive content in various ways including A Automatic publishing first publication as a lesson to be run on the Teach platform and content update a differential update of content that will affect only content of lessons that were not used in class such as a differential content update ability which allows for ongoing improvement of the content without changes to content that was used in class while on the other hand classes and or students that never accessed and used this content may benefit from the update which is generally developed to introduce improvements add or delete text images or interactions according to feedback from users or to correct mistakes . The added value is educational and or pedagogical once a teacher class students used a portion of digital educational content course lesson then this content becomes a basis for future steps of learning in the same course b basis for assessment of accomplishments of the students e.g. questions in assessment events are based on this content c revision content for the students when preparing for test as this chunk of content is part of their learning history . Once introduced to a class and studied interacted by the students this content must not be changed for the students of this class at least not as long as the school year is not finished or as long as the teacher did not indicate willingness for refreshing . The automatic differential update may be over ridden by a teacher e.g. if he wants to re teach the course lesson to the same class by choosing a refresh content order that empties all the content from all students interactions with it. In this case the content will become unused and will be updated as any unused content. B Package and Publish as a Sharable Content Object Reference Model SCROM package an Educational Application. C Data driven publishing when run on the Teach platform the content is continuously monitored and reported to the Create user and the system may perform analysis of the usage reports of the educational computerized content from large numbers of students allowing constant improvement of the content. Accordingly the system gives the content publisher an ongoing picture and feedback about his released content and may save him a lot of time and efforts as the Teach platform can provide him with information that otherwise could only be gained by distributing a preliminary draft version to some testing schools classes or focus group monitor their use and gather information about their satisfaction and accomplishments . The monitoring recording and reporting features of the Teach platform can send to the Create platform valuable information. Based on this feedback data the publisher author of the content may a understand user s satisfaction based on usage reports providing information indicating what parts or types of content are used by more users and or more frequently than other parts and use the wisdom of the crowd to improve the content product b understand if the content is aligned with students understanding level and abilities at a certain age group based on usage reports that can indicate too complicated or too difficult interactions e.g. intense trial and error type of use or intense use or hints and helps by on level and above level students or too simple or easy interactions e.g. all answers are correct even from bellow level students or the time taken by the students to answer a chunk of interactions is much shorter than planned estimated c understand if questions in the content are written properly based on correct incorrect answers e.g. an overwhelming number of mistakes in answers for a question may indicate un clear use of language in the question or misleading distracting wording in the question or answer options .

In another example when using the Create platform to generate lessons and interactions by school teachers adapting content for use by colleagues and the results of use by their students may serve as wisdom of the crowed to correct mistakes or to improve quality of the lesson flow and the integrated interactions and or applets. For example Teacher A creates a digital learning unit about ratios in math comprising of 5 lessons each lesson includes a solved example of an exercise in ratios and ten exercises for practice by students and a Ratios Applet that combines and presents different presentations of ratios e.g. painted unpainted areas dilutions of colored liquid in clear water numbers of individual under a certain age in a crowd and equivalent mathematical expressions like A B or C D and may be called and used by the students as a scaffolding tool. The lessons are imported for use by 4 fellow teachers and assigned by them to their 100 students within a week. The content creator Teacher A who is recognized by the system as the lessons author queries the Create platform to generate a usage and progress report from all the users of this digital learning unit on the Teach platform. The report is generated indicating that 80 of students failed most of the exercises in the third lesson. Teacher A checks the third lessons interactions and the Ratio Applet and finds that the wording used in the Applet for the representations of the colored liquid dilutions in water and the wording used in the exercises are not the same indicating a possible cause for confusion. Teacher A modifies the wording accordingly. The report is also indicating that in the fifth lesson about 90 of the students even those in the below level groups have completed successfully the given exercises within about 35 percent of the predicted or planned or allotted time. Teacher A checks the fifth lesson s interactions descriptors and finds out that he published for that lesson a copy of those interactions already published in the fourth lesson Teacher A then edits lesson the fifth lesson to include the right questions and to re publish the entire unit.

The present invention may include an adaptive teaching learning system or a Digital Teaching Platform DTP or a Learning Management System LMS which may present digital learning objects to students who utilize student stations or other suitable electronic devices. Each student may utilize a student station or student device e.g. a desktop computer a laptop computer a tablet a smartphone or the like which may present to the student interactive digital educational content for example a story having text and or audio narration a quiz questions having multiple choice answers questions or phrases with fill in the blank regions math questions reading comprehension or the like. A server computer may dynamically allocate different digital learning objects to different students who utilize in turn different student stations or devices thereby allowing differential and adaptive teaching. For example the server may adjust add remove or modify one or more features of a digital learning object e.g. add or remove audio narration add or remove an on screen calculator add or remove an on screen numbers line add or remove an on screen dictionary or thesaurus or word bank tool to accommodate a particular need or a particular ability increased or decreased of a particular student. A teacher station may be used to manage the teaching learning in real time to selectively modify in real time while class is in session parameters of digital learning object s of one or more student stations e.g. adding more time to complete a task adding or removing on screen tools as well as to allocate or re allocate digital learning objects to various student stations e.g. change order of previously allocated digital learning objects add or remove a digital learning object for one or more student stations . The teacher station further allows the teacher to view in real time the progress of each student in completing tasks using his her student station and further allows the teacher to view cumulative data historic data data related to performance of a group of students or the like. The system may further include automatic Computer Aided Assessment CAA modules modules for repetitive training or drilling of particular subject matters alert modules reporting modules or the like.

The present invention may automatically or semi automatically generate Digital Learning Objects DLOs which may then be used by the teaching learning system in order to present interactive pedagogical tasks that students can engage in using her student stations.

For example a DLO generator may include the following units which may be implemented using suitable hardware components and or software modules 

 1 An input unit able to receive educational content or pedagogical content which may typically be in a non interactive format. The input may be for example a Portable Document Format PDF file or document and may include text and or images. Other suitable input file s may be used for example a Microsoft Word file or other word processing file a Microsoft Excel file or other spreadsheet file a Microsoft PowerPoint file or other presentation file a Rich Text Format RTF file a text file TXT or the like.

 2 An optional Optical Character Recognition OCR module which may optionally perform OCR on the input file in order to convert bitmap based data into distinct textual characters which may then be further utilized by the system.

 3 A converter module to perform a preliminary step in which the non interactive initial input for example the PDF file is converted to a format or language or representation which may be interactive or may be suitable for further conversion into an interactive applet. For example the converter may convert the initial PDF file into an HTML5 which may be visually identical or generally visually similar to the visual appearance of the initial PDF file.

 4 An element identifier module which may analyze the converted version that the converter produced in order to identify one or more elements visual elements textual elements visual elements patterns or the like. For example the element identifier module may identify a header a footer a title an introduction region an image a question region an answer region a multiple choice question items that comprise a set of multiple choice answers a math question an open question a fill in the blank question or sentence a doze a matching task a narrative a free text box or the like. The user may configure the element identifier module to identify other suitable types of elements based on other pre defined criteria.

 5 Optionally the identification may be performed based on contextual analysis based on recognizing that a certain textual component is a question e.g. ending with a question mark beginning with a question word such as who or what or where or when or why based on recognizing that a portion of the content is a list of items e.g. four multiple choice answers preceded with a b c and d and optionally starting with the word because based on identification of a particular term or phrase from a pre defined list or table of phrases e.g. Please choose the most accurate answer or Which one of these is true based on identification of action words or commands e.g. calculate explain describe fill in solve demonstrate and or based on other suitable attributes or criteria.

 6 A manual mover module providing the user a drag and drop interface or other suitable interface such that a user may review the converted data and may select and drag portions thereof or otherwise move portions thereof into one or more pre defined areas or regions. For example the user may drag a question sentence from a first portion of the screen which shows the PDF to HTML5 converted content towards a second portion of the screen which shows for example a first region for a Story a second region for an Image a third region for a Question a fourth region for Answers or the like . The user may thus drag and drop portions of the original PDF file which have been converted automatically into HTML5 elements onto particular regions or place holders in a template. The manual mover module may also include a labeling module allowing a user to create or modify a label of a selected portion of the content for example in case the pre suggested labels e.g. Question Answers Story are not suitable.

 7 An automatic mover module which automatically moves or copies identified elements into particular regions or place holders in a template for example moving or copying the text of an identified Question sentence into a place holder or box for a Question in the template moving or copying the text of identified multiple choice answers into the corresponding place holder s or region s in the template or the like. The automatic mover module may also include a labeling module able to create or attach a label e.g. from a pre defined pool of labels to various elements in the template.

 8 A flow management module which may automatically manage the process in which the DLO generator identifies elements of the initial contents and places them into a suitable DLO template.

 9 A template selector allowing manual selection by the user of a suitable DLO template for a particular initial input file and or allowing automatic selection by the system of a suitable DLO template for a particular initial input file. For example based on initial analysis by the element identifier module the DLO generator may determine that the initial input corresponds the best to a math question template and thus the template selector may automatically select a DLO template which suits a math question.

 10 Optionally a DLO compiler module able to take the DLO template in which the user and or the system inserted content into particular place holders or regions or boxes and able to generate from that template and its content an interactive DLO based on pre defined rules that are associated with the DLO template being used or based on pre defined rules that are associated with the boxes or place holders within that DLO template . The DLO compiler module may not necessarily compile an executable file but rather may be able to generate a DLO in an interactive format or in a rich media format for example HTML5 JavaScript Adobe Flash Adobe AIR Ajax Flex Rich Internet Applications RIA Java an applet an embedded element a rich media element a stand alone element an element displayable via a Web browser an element able to run in a browser less environment e.g. utilizing an operating system or a particular runtime environment 

For example a DLO template may be associated with pre defined rules or with a script or a flow which dictates an order of presenting items on the screen an order of presenting output and receiving input or the like. For example a story question answer DLO template may be associated with a script or a flow such that at first the user is shown the story optionally with audio narration e.g. using an automated text to speech converter then after a pre defined period of time e.g. 60 seconds the question element appears and multiple choice answers appear then the user is prompted to select an answer and the flow continues to provide feedback to the user on his her choice of answer e.g. you are correct or you are incorrect try again .

In another example some DLO template elements may be associated with particular rules or a script or flow pertaining to their own behavior. For example a multiple choice answers element may be associated with a user interface that allows the user to select one answer e.g. radio buttons or to select multiple answers e.g. check box elements .

 11 A DLO transporter able to transport or copy the generated DLO to a proper storage device DLO repository cloud based storage or repository network location student station server remote location or other suitable destination in which the DLO may be stored and or may be interacted upon.

 12 A user generated content module allowing a teacher or other user to view and modify already existing educational content and to convert it into or save it as a new DLO or to import or input content into a previously created e.g. empty or partially filled DLO or to create a new DLO starting from scratch e.g. a simple DLO having few boxes or place holders or a more complex DLO associated with various scripts or flows or rules . Optionally a DLO editor modifier module may be used allowing the teacher or user to view modify and or edit a previously created DLO.

Some embodiments of the present invention may allow an educator or other user to easily and efficiently convert in an automatic or semi automatic computer aided process a PDF file or other suitable non interactive content container into an interactive DLO or to perform a save as operation of a content file into a DLO format or structure.

The present invention may include a system and method for enabling and administering adaptive teaching in a learning environment with digital devices. The system may be based on automated content conversion from any digital format of TextBook PDF ePub Rich text into a format that allows the system and its users a teacher or any authorized authority to create modify administer and manage an eCourse based on that TextBook that may be run on any computerized device smart board laptop tablet desktop computer smartphone electronic reader eBook reader . The teaching learning system may enable the teacher by using a teacher station or other suitable computerized device to do one or more of the following 1 Import a digitized textbook converted and enhanced to the system s course format from a catalogue or repository or local source or remote source 2 Modify flow of the course e.g. edit or modify or re arrange the Table of Content TOC and or related content to fit a preferred teaching flow learning environment classroom synchronous online teaching learning non synchronous or a synchronous online teaching learning and teaching method being used 3 Modify the educational content to fit learners group individuals and their learning needs difficulty level learning style limitation disability special ability or advantage by adding or removing any type of files or any element or application element by editing the course interactive content by adding user interactive generated content from provided tools within the system 4 Manage the content allocation to students group individuals in and out of the classroom or in and out of lesson sequence 5 Monitor student progress and interactions with the content in real time and while generating real time alerts and notifications to the teacher about progress of one or more students groups of students and the entire class 6 Control students activities and communicate with them in real time and or beyond the lesson time period 7 Review and grade students submitted work and send back to students the graded or commented work or assignments or homework for the students to further review 8 Generate and or receive analyzed reports on students performance with regard to individual student a group or subset of students or an entire class.

The teacher may be able to react to students progress based upon dashboard indications and notifications and may check why progress is slow or why certain students are making too many mistakes he may activate the All eyes to the teacher feature or may address a single student or a group of students in the class that has problems while others are doing their independent work on their stations. The teacher may change or edit lesson flow or lesson content typically after the lesson ends in response to the End of lesson report or to reports of assessment events. The planning like activities that a teacher may perform in real time while the lesson is in progress may include for example changing or moving or dragging the Stop Line to a new location dragging a students name avatar icon from one group to another group or otherwise modifying groups or re grouping students writing a comment or virtual sticky note to himself with regard to particular student s or topics or content or the like. Optionally some implementations allow the teacher to perform in real time while the lesson is in progress or subsequently after the lesson has ended one or more modifications and or changes as described herein.
