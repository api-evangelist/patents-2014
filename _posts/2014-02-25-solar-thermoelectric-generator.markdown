title: Solar thermoelectric generator
abstract: Solar thermoelectric generators (STEGs) are solid state heat engines that generate electricity from concentrated sunlight. A novel detailed balance model for STEGs is provided and applied to both state-of-the-art and idealized materials. STEGs can produce electricity by using sunlight to heat one side of a thermoelectric generator. While concentrated sunlight can be used to achieve extremely high temperatures (and thus improved generator efficiency), the solar absorber also emits a significant amount of black body radiation. This emitted light is the dominant loss mechanism in these generators. In this invention, we propose a solution to this problem that eliminates virtually all of the emitted black body radiation. This enables solar thermoelectric generators to operate at higher efficiency and achieve said efficient with lower levels of optical concentration. The solution is suitable for both single and dual axis solar thermoelectric generators.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 769 006 filed Feb. 25 2013 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.

This invention was made with government support under award number DE AR0670 4918 from the Advanced Research Projects Agency Energy U.S. Department of Energy. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

A method and apparatus for a solar thermoelectric generator with improved efficiency is provided. More specifically a solar thermoelectric generator with a thermal cavity to reduce the angle of blackbody emission is provided.

There are many technologies available to directly harness the sun s energy the most prevalent of which are photovoltaics and solar thermal also known as concentrated solar power or CSP . Installed CSP plants which use conventional heat engines to generate electric power from a temperature gradient typically operate at 14 16 efficiency. Solar thermal technologies produce electric power from a temperature gradient traditionally by using conventional heat engines. Solid state heat engines in the form of thermoelectric generators TEGs can also exploit this temperature gradient to generate power. Solar thermoelectric generators STEGs are solid state heat engines that generate electricity from concentrated sunlight. STEGs can operate at higher temperatures than CSP systems and do not require moving generator parts or working fluids.

Solar thermoelectric generators STEGs like photovoltaic systems and concentrating solar power plants generate electricity by harnessing the energy of sunlight. Because STEGs are solid state devices their lack of moving parts or need for high temperature operating fluids and their robustness in harsh environments make them an attractive technology for standalone power conversion or in hybrid solar thermal systems. While the traditionally low efficiency of thermoelectric devices has relegated their use to such applications as waste heat recovery recent improvements in thermoelectric devices may make STEGs a viable technology for direct solar to electric energy conversion.

Advances in thermoelectric TE materials have brought renewed attention to the potential for STEGs to serve as part of a renewable energy portfolio. Solar thermoelectric generators rely on the Seebeck effect which describes the tendency of free charge carriers in a temperature gradient to diffuse from the hot to the cold side. These solid state devices are attractive for the following reasons a the working fluid is simply charge carriers electrons and holes b they can operate at extremely high temperatures enabling a high Carnot efficiency c they are majority carrier devices which can tolerate high levels of defects compared to photovoltaic devices and d all wavelengths of sunlight can be absorbed.

In 1954 Maria Telkes reported the first experimental STEG efficiency using flat plate collectors in combination with a ZnSb BiSb thermocouple. M. Telkes Solar Thermoelectric Generators J. A. P. 1 13 25 1954 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. This device demonstrated 0.6 efficiency which increased to 3.4 when a 50 fold concentrating lens was added. After this initial study experimental STEG work has been intermittent with low efficiency values due to relatively low hot side temperatures and the lack of vacuum encapsulation to prevent convective losses.

A paper by G.

A. P. 109 104908 2011 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Chen advocates for increasing the efficiency of the STEG by using a selective absorber to maximize the net flux into the thermal concentrator. Chen predicts that STEG efficiencies of approximately 12 can be achieved with 10 fold optical concentration and 200 fold thermal concentration for a module operating at 527 C. with an average zT of 1.

A paper by McEnaney et al. modeled segmented and cascaded BiTe skutterudite STEGs using data from currently existing thermoelectric materials and selective surfaces. K. McEnaney D. Kraemer Z. F. Ren and G. Chen J. A. P. 110 2011 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The efficiency of the cascaded design was predicted to be the highest reaching 16 at 600 C. While this study did much to shed light on the important design variables of a STEG the predicted device performance was determined by finite element modeling for a specific generator design and TE materials. Thus to date STEG modeling efforts have been numerical approaches or have used CPM to address TE performance limiting the applicability of these models.

While solar driven thermoelectric generators have been known for more than a century the total efficiencies of these STEGs remain very low below 5 . Further there has not been any effort to decrease the radiative losses in a STEG via either a a narrow opening at the focal point of the concentrated solar flux or b photonic surfaces within a cavity that create angular emission restrictions for decreased radiative losses. Note that the term cavity may be used interchangeably herein with thermal cavity optical cavity and enclosure. All of the previous approaches have used a simple possibly selective in wavelength flat plate absorber with no thermal shielding to decrease radiative losses. Prior STEGs also do not put the absorber beyond the focal point of the concentrating optics also called an optical concentrator herein . Thus it is one aspect of the present invention to provide a novel design for a STEG.

Another aspect of embodiments of the present invention is to provide high efficiency concentrated STEGs. STEGs have several advantages as compared to existing solar technologies. Unlike traditional solar thermal generators STEGs are solid state devices with no moving parts which greatly increase reliability and lifetime. Additionally STEGs are a scalable technology that can be used for small or large scale applications. While photovoltaics are limited to the fraction of incident solar radiation above the bandgap STEGs utilize a larger portion of the solar spectrum.

It is one aspect of embodiments the present invention to provide a generalized description of STEGs that is analytic and is not limited by the CPM. Optimized TE geometries selective absorbers and total efficiencies for given optical and thermal concentrations are considered. This global optimization is done from the view of a fixed hot side temperature because of the inherent temperature limits of TE materials. Further advanced TE materials experimental data is used to design an optimized STEG module.

One aspect of embodiments of the present invention is to provide a STEG with five subsystems 1 optical concentration 2 thermal absorber 3 thermoelectric module 4 cooling system and 5 vacuum encapsulation. The first subsystem is an optical system to concentrate the solar radiation. The second subsystem is a thermal absorber to convert the incident light to heat which then flows to the thermoelectric module the third subsystem . The cold side temperature of the TE is maintained by a passive or active cooling system the fourth subsystem . Finally the thermal absorber TE module and cooling system are encapsulated in a vacuum enclosure to prevent conductive and convective heat losses to the air. The vacuum enclosure could be similar to those used in evacuated solar hot water systems which are widely used and have demonstrated lifetimes greater than 15 years.

Another aspect of embodiments of the present invention is to provide a STEG with three subsystems the 1 solar absorber 2 thermoelectric generator and 3 heat management system.

It is a further aspect of the present invention to provide a STEG with improved efficiency. More specifically a STEG with a total efficiency greater than 14 is provided. The total STEG efficiency is the product of the individual subsystems efficiencies. Thus the total efficiency of a STEG depends on the optical absorber and thermoelectric subsystem efficiencies.

It is one aspect of the present invention to provide a STEG that dramatically reduces the radiative losses from the absorber. In order for the thermal absorber to effectively convert the incident light to heat the absorber surface must have a high absorptivity. However by Kirchoff s Law this also invokes a high emissivity leading to large radiative losses. When past attempts have addressed this radiative loss problem they have focused on using a selective absorber which has energy dependent absorptivity emissivity. For a high temperature STEG the radiative losses from the absorber account for a significant fraction of the STEG s efficiency losses. With today s absorbers realistic efficiencies of the absorbers are almost 50 . As the total STEG efficiency is the product of the individual subsystem efficiencies having an absorber with an efficiency below 50 is a serious loss to the STEG s overall efficiency.

One aspect of the present invention is to achieve high values of the hot side temperature Th by looking to high levels of optical concentration as well as optical and thermal concentration systems with high efficiencies. The TE efficiency within the STEG is defined as the ratio of the output electric work to the input heat. Like all heat engines the efficiency of TEGs is limited by the Carnot efficiency. For a fixed cold side temperature Tc an increase in the hot side temperature Th will result in a higher total efficiency of the thermoelectric generator.

One aspect of various embodiments the present invention is to provide a STEG with a thermoelectric material that generates a voltage in response to a temperature gradient. The efficiency of a thermoelectric material is governed by its figure of merit zT defined as zT T where is the Seebeck coefficient the thermal conductivity and the electrical resistivity. Until recently thermoelectric materials had demonstrated peak zT values of 0.5 0.8 leading to low conversion efficiencies and limiting these materials to niche applications. With the advent of nanostructured thermoelectrics and complex bulk materials in the 1990s there has been a sharp increase in zT.

One aspect of embodiments of the present invention is to develop a novel detailed balance model for STEGs and apply this model to both state of the art and idealized materials. This model uses thermoelectric compatibility theory to provide analytic solutions to device efficiency in idealized materials with temperature dependent properties. The results of this modeling allow for predictions of maximum theoretical STEG efficiencies and suggestions of general design rules for STEGs. In one embodiment with today s materials a STEG with an incident flux of 100 kWmand a hot side temperature of 1000 C. could achieve 15.9 overall generator efficiency making STEGs competitive with concentrated solar power plants. Future developments may depend on materials that can provide higher operating temperatures or higher material efficiency. For example a STEG with zT 2 at 1500 C. would have an efficiency of 30.6 .

Thus it is another aspect of the present invention to provide a STEG with a cavity positioned above the absorber which dramatically reduces the angle and amount of blackbody emission. This approach takes advantage of the concentration required to achieve the high temperatures 1000 C. of a high efficiency STEG. In one embodiment sunlight is concentrated down through an optical concentrator to a focal point and the absorber is put on the far side of this focal point. A cavity is constructed from the absorber up to the focal point and a pin hole or other aperture in the cavity enables the concentrated light to enter the cavity. The walls of the cavity may exhibit low thermal conductivity e.g. radiative baffling and may be at a temperature close to the high temperature of the absorber. With a cavity the dominant radiative loss is then restricted to a narrow angular range determined by the geometry of the cavity and the aperture. Thus the directed nature of sunlight enables optical engineering to significantly decrease the radiative losses and thereby run a more efficient STEG with less solar concentration.

In one embodiment of the present invention a detailed balance approach to deriving the maximum theoretical STEG efficiency is provided. The optimized STEG uses a solar selective absorber to efficiently capture the incident solar flux while limiting radiative losses. We predict that a STEG made with today s materials zT 1 and a hot side temperature of 1000 C. could achieve an efficiency of 15.9 under illumination by 100 suns. With reasonable improvements in thermoelectric materials zT 2 we expect a limiting efficiency of 23.5 for the same hot side temperature and level of illumination.

In some embodiments the STEG can operate as both as a standalone energy conversion technology and as a topping cycle for existing concentrating solar power CSP technologies.

In one embodiment the STEG comprises high efficiency TEG couples to serve as the power generating device. Maximizing the solar absorptance while minimizing losses due to blackbody radiation at the hot side is critical to maintaining high efficiency under solar illumination. Thus in some embodiments the STEG includes an improved solar selective absorber coating that will allow for high absorptance over the solar spectrum while inhibiting emittance of the blackbody spectrum at 1000 C. The STEG design may also include a thermally insulating cavity that allows concentrated sunlight to enter through an aperture but further limit radiative losses.

In one embodiment a solar electrical generator is provided comprising a radiation capture structure having a front surface and a back surface said front surface being adapted for exposure to solar radiation so as to generate heat and at least one thermoelectric converter thermally coupled to said structure at a high temperature end thereof to receive at least a portion of said generated heat such that a temperature differential is achieved across the at least one thermoelectric converter wherein said radiation capture structure comprises a capture area and the plurality of thermoelectric converters comprises a converter area a ratio of capture area to converter area being greater than about 100.

In another embodiment a electric generator powered by a solar thermal electric power source is provided comprising a parabolic solar dish to collect and reflectively concentrate solar photon energy into a heat containment housing which may be a vacuum that contains a heat absorber which may be some black body heat absorber to trap heat energy from the solar photon energy and that manages a thermal energy flow into a thermal electric generation device.

By way of providing additional background context and to further satisfy the written description requirements of 35 U.S.C. 112 the following references are incorporated by reference in their entireties for the express purpose of explaining the nature of solar thermoelectric generators and to further describe the various methods tools components pieces and other apparatuses commonly associated therewith 

U.S. Patent Pub. No. 2010 0252085 to Gotthold describes a portable direct solar thermoelectric generator 

To assist in the understanding of the embodiments of the present invention the following list of components and associated numbering found in the drawings is provided herein 

It should be understood that the drawings are not necessarily to scale and various dimensions may be altered. In certain instances details that are not necessary for an understanding of the invention or that render other details difficult to perceive may have been omitted. It should be understood of course that the invention is not necessarily limited to the particular embodiments illustrated herein.

To provide further clarity to the detailed description provided herein in the associated drawings the following list of variables and their definitions are provided as follows 

STEGs operate by absorbing sunlight which generates a temperature gradient which in turn generates electricity through the Seebeck effect. The efficiency of a STEG therefore depends on both the efficiency with which sunlight is converted to heat and on the thermoelectric efficiency of the device. The thermoelectric efficiency depends on the temperature difference across the device and the temperature dependent figure of merit of the thermoelectric materials zT S k T where S is the Seebeck coefficient is the electrical conductivity k is the thermal conductivity and T is the absolute temperature. The maximum efficiency of a TEG is given by

The first subsystem of a STEG is the optical concentration system . In some embodiments optical concentration systems for high efficiency STEGs may be the same as those used for concentrated photovoltaic or solar thermal applications. Examples include Fresnel lenses heliostats in conjunction with a central receiver system and parabolic dishes and troughs. For use in a STEG the pertinent characteristics are the level of concentration reached the tracking system required and the optical efficiency.

The optical concentration ratio is defined as the ratio of the optical concentrator area i.e. the area of the lens or mirror that receives the incident light to the absorber area upon which the light is focused. Considering one sun to be approximately 1 kW m the flux after concentration is given by this solar flux multiplied by the optical concentration ratio. The concentration ratio is mainly limited by the type of solar tracking used. For a static concentrator with no tracking the optical concentration ratio is limited to about 10. When single axis tracking is introduced a concentration ratio of 100 can be achieved above which dual axis tracking systems are required.

The optical efficiency is the ratio of light that reaches the absorber to the total light incident upon the optical concentrator and increases with improved tracking systems. Typical optical efficiencies are 40 for static concentrators 60 for single axis tracking and 85 90 for dual axis tracking. With dual axis tracking the optical losses of the tracking system itself are very low other losses due to factors such as soiling of the lens surface reflection and absorption are still present. Additionally increased tracking increases the system cost.

To reach the targeted hot side temperature of 1000 C. we will employ optical concentration of the incoming sunlight. As discussed above with sufficient suppression of heat losses through the use of a selective absorber cavity and vacuum enclosure an optical concentration at the absorber surface 

The thermal cavity requires that the beam enter through an aperture that is smaller than the absorber and diverge to completely irradiate the absorber surface. Therefore to capitalize on the improved absorber efficiency afforded by the thermal cavity we must add secondary optics to tailor the incoming beam to the STEG prototype. To accommodate the small size of the STEG and aperture in the cavity we will place secondary focusing optics in the beam path to further tighten the beam waist. We have modeled a series of lenses with different numbers of primary mirrors to identify the optimum optical components for integrating the STEG prototype into the HFSF. The key parameters for selection are i the area of the beam at the waist which defines the aperture in the cavity ii the distance from the focus at which the beam completely fills the absorber area which defines the height of the cavity and iii the intensity at the absorber surface. Table 1 shows the modeling results of placing a 5 cm diameter aperture and lens at the focus of the primary concentrator. We find that the beam waist decreases with decreasing focal length but the divergence increases decreasing both the height and average intensity at the absorber. While using more mirrors increases the intensity this also increases the waist and decreases the height. The 3 mirror subarray with a 6 cm focal length lens should deliver sufficient intensity while allowing for a cavity with a small aperture for efficient solar absorption.

The 1000 C. operating temperature of the STEG requires modification of the multilayer coating to optimize performance at the elevated temperature. Optimization includes changes in layer thicknesses and a lower targeted cutoff wavelength. The predicted performance of this design a 9 layer stack optimized for 1000 C. is better than any commercially available product with average absorption of 0.976 over the band from 300 1300 nm and total solar weighted absorptance of 0.938. The calculated emittance of the design is 0.21. After annealing at 1000 C. the film retains a high room temperature absorptance of 0.884. However the infrared reflectance is lower than predicted. Measuring the optical properties of annealed individual layers to use as inputs in the model rather than literature values improves the as deposited performance. Different deposition conditions to produce films with better purity of the targeted crystalline phases for the individual layers and examining alternate material systems may be used to improve the selectivity of the deposited films.

In one embodiment the entire system view of the heat fluxes in the STEG can be modeled. From we can write a heat balance for the absorber 1 Maximizing qfor a given q and thus q requires minimizing q. Here we model the effects of radiation shielding on qand the resultant subsystem and STEG efficiencies.

The third subsystem is the thermoelectric module . shows one embodiment of a thermoelectric module . The module has unicouples linked electrically in series. The thermoelectric modules consist of n type and p type materials that are electrically connected. When a load is connected across the cold ends the Seebeck effect will cause current to flow through the load generating electrical power.

Many thermoelectric unicouples would be combined into much larger modules significantly reducing the constraints on the optics and allowing for larger beam waists while maintaining the high ratio of absorber area to waist area Aa Aw required for an efficient optical cavity. Further description is provided in by M. L. Olsen et al. SolarPACES 2013 and by Lauryn L. Baranowski et al. Journal of Electronic Materials 2014 the entire disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.

A multilayer selective absorber film is shown in . At high operating temperatures radiation losses from the top surface can limit device performance. Selective absorbers are designed to maximize absorption of visible lights while minimizing the emission of black body radiation. The optical properties of multilayer selective absorber films can be tuned by changing the materials and layer thicknesses. In one embodiment films are designed and fabricated using a new class of materials optimized for operation at 1000 C. and fabricated using physical vapor deposition.

As shown in the STEG also includes a non uniform cavity to physically block thermal radiation from escaping and redirect it to the absorber surface . In a non uniform cavity only one surface absorbs the incoming light with the other surfaces reflect emitted radiation back to the active surface which enables the achievement of high temperatures with lower levels of optical concentration. A uniform cavity requires higher levels of optical concentration to achieve the same efficiency as a non uniform cavity. The operating principle of the cavity is that concentrated sunlight is focused to a waist and enters through a small aperture at the top of the cavity . The light diverges inside the cavity to fully irradiate the absorber surface . Any sunlight that is reflected by the absorber or blackbody radiation that is emitted from the absorber surface is then i reflected by the cavity specifically by the cavity walls ii absorbed and thermally reemitted by the cavity or iii lost through the aperture . The proper choice of cavity geometry can increase the probability that the reflected light will be directed back toward the absorber surface . Using multiple layers of foil for the cavity improves its insulating behavior increasing the probability that thermal radiation will be reemitted into the cavity and absorbed by the device rather than lost through the walls . Designing the cavity such that the area of the aperture is much smaller than the absorber area limits the solid angle through which radiation can escape.

One embodiment of a STEG that employs a state of the art TEG 3 with high optical concentration 200 300 Suns at the absorber surface to achieve a sunlight generated T 1000 C. with a targeted total efficiency of 15 is provided and shown in . In addition to the efficient TEG 3 to reach the efficiency target the novel STEG requires i an absorber that is well matched to the solar spectrum ii minimal heat losses due to thermal radiation iii a vacuum environment to eliminate convective heat losses and prevent degradation of the STEG and iv an additional actively cooled BiTethermoelectric stage which is expected to increase the total TEG efficiency to 18 by allowing for a lower T. To simultaneously meet requirements i and ii a solar selective absorber will be coupled with a thermally insulating cavity . The STEG further includes a stand and feed throughs for stage control electronics and cooling. The vacuum chamber can include a port which may be a lens or a window to allow light into the chamber . In one embodiment the port includes a water cooled quartz window. An embodiment of this design is shown in .

As can be seen in the incident solar flux and the black body emission spectrum peak at different energies. In an ideal selective absorber the absorptivity takes the form of a step function in which the step from zero to one is located between the black body and solar flux maxima. The location of the step edge is referred to as the cutoff energy. This optimum cutoff energy is function of both temperature and optical concentration. A selective absorber can be used to maximize the flux absorbed and minimize the flux re radiated to the atmosphere. Here the optimized energy cutoff is shown for a direct incident flux of 200 kW mand a black body temperature of 1000 C. show that even with an ideally selective absorber which is far from currently achievable the absorber efficiency at 1000 C. is only 80 .

Materials such as semiconductors are often considered intrinsic absorbers meaning that they exhibit some solar selectivity as pure materials. For a semiconductor the cutoff value between high and low absorptivities is determined by the bandgap of the material. In recent years intrinsic absorbers have been used as the starting materials for high performing selective absorbers ranging from simple layered designs to highly sophisticated plasmonic and photonic structures. High temperature absorbers above 750 C. have been developed that exhibit solar absorptivities above 0.8 and thermal emissivities below 0.15.

The absorber surface at the base of the cavity is defined as surface 2. The inner walls of the radiation shield are defined as surface 3 in the cylinder this is split up into 3a and 3b for calculation reasons . For the cylinder and the cone we have three free parameters r r and h. The value of h for the hemisphere is not a free parameter but rather is dictated by rand r. In the following analysis we consider the ratio of r2 to r1 rather than their individual values. Similarly we write h values as multiples of r.

These assumptions allow us to draw the thermal circuit model shown in . There are two kinds of resistances modeled in this circuit. The first resistor on the left for surface 2 is the resistance to heat loss through radiation. As can be seen from the equation as surface 2 approaches a black body approaches 1 this resistance becomes zero note that there is no analogous resistor for surface 1 because we already assumed this surface to be a black body . The other resistances shown in the circuit are geometry dependent factors. These depend on both the area of each surface and the view factor between the surfaces. View factors are written as F denoting the view factor from surface x to surface y. For common geometries such as those in analytic expressions to calculate view factors are readily available.

Here the terms in the numerator are the result of integrating the black body emission spectrum over all wavelengths.

Because we assumed that the absorber surface was a gray or black body the heat absorbed can simply be written as 5 

Eq. 8 immediately allows us to examine the limiting case in which qapproaches zero. We see that giving an expression for the maximum STEG efficiency 

Provided that radiation losses can be sufficiently minimized Eq. 9 makes it clear that using a black body 1 as the absorber surface will yield the highest STEG efficiency. Also interesting to note is that qis not present in the equation leaving a STEG efficiency that depends only on the absorber emissivity and the TE properties. Note a black body is better than a gray body. A wavelength dependent selective absorber will be the model built next.

We model with a STEG with a hot side temperature T of 1273 K a cold side temperature T of 300 K and a zT of 1. As discussed above we assume that the absorber surface is a black body 1 . We plot the STEG efficiency as a function of the ratio of the absorber r to aperture r radii. For the cylinder and the cone two outer bounds on the value of h are used h r lower bound and h r 10 upper bound .

As predicted by Eq. 9 as the radiative losses approach zero the STEG efficiency asymptotes to a maximum value. Additionally this maximum efficiency is not dependent on the value of q the efficiency curves in q 100 kW m and q 200 kW m asymptote to the same value. Thus the incident flux has no effect on the STEG efficiency when r r 10.

Regardless of the shape of the cavity the maximum efficiency can be obtained when r r 10. This indicates that radiative losses are effectively eliminated when the absorber radius is more than 10 the aperture radius.

We can also explore the effect of radiation shielding on the thermal length of the TEG. The thermal length L is defined as the product of the TE leg length l and the thermal concentration . The thermal concentration is given by the ratio of the absorber A to TE A areas. For the STEG parameters given in the previous section we plot the thermal length in centimeters as a function of r rin .

We see that the thermal length behaves similarly to the STEG efficiency in that the shape and h value of the cavity are not important for r r 10. The thermal length drops as r rincreases which is a result of decreasing the radiative losses. This results in an overall greater heat flux into the TE and so the TE is required to be less thermally resistive smaller L to maintain a given value of T. For the same reason increasing the incident flux results in a smaller thermal length.

At r r 10 the thermal length values for incident fluxes of 100 kW mand 200 kW mare 1.54 cm and 0.76 cm respectively. In the STEG without radiation shielding increasing STEG efficiency required moving to higher incident fluxes. This created a problem in that the thermal lengths dictated by these fluxes were often less than a reasonable value for the TE leg length such that 10. Thus it is possible to use the more reasonable value of 1.54 cm at 100 kW m without sacrificing device efficiency.

If a lens or mirror is used to bring the focus into a point the cavity should be constructed with a pinhole at the focal point. A linear focusing mirror such as a trough or lenses may be used with the pinhole replaced by a slit at the focal line.

Thermal properties of cavity walls The cavity walls must be thermally insulating. One embodiment is with thermal baffling which can be used to reduce the radiative transfer. Embedding the thermal cavity within a vacuum will reduce convective losses.

The cavity should be designed with a form factor to minimize the radiation from the cavity walls to the pinhole slit. However any geometry is better than not having a thermal cavity. For a pin hole focus a cylinder with the pinhole on one flat end and the absorber on the other is a simile geometry which will serve this purpose. For the slit focus one geometry is a hemi cylinder with the slit running along the axis of the hemi cylinder thereby creating two quarter cylinders 

The surface properties of the cavity and absorber can be textured or coated with a photonic structure to provide angularly resolved emission properties. The over riding goals for the absorber are to a absorb the incident concentrated solar flux b emit little in the blackbody energy regime and c minimize emission away from the pinhole slit. The goals of a and b are in conflict and an optimized selective absorber will strike a compromise between this emission and absorption. To minimize emission away from the slit a textured or photonic structure on the absorber would be beneficial. Considering the walls of the thermal cavity the main goal is to reduce emission from the walls to the pinhole slit. The photons leaving from this process are purely a loss mechanism. Along with the geometry of the thermal cavity an angularly resolved surface coating can be used to minimize this loss mechanism.

We can also explore the effect of radiation shielding on the thermal length of the TEG. The thermal length L is defined as the product of the TE leg length l and the thermal concentration . The thermal concentration is given by the ratio of the absorber A to TE A areas. For the STEG parameters given in the previous section we plot the thermal length in cm as a function of r rin .

The N and P type material may be a semiconductor i.e. a material that has electrical conductivity between that of a conductor such as copper and that of an insulator such as glass . Typically N type semiconductors have a larger electron concentration than hole concentration. The phrase n type comes from the negative charge of the electron. In N type semiconductors electrons are the majority carriers and holes are the minority carriers. N type semiconductors are created by doping an intrinsic semiconductor with donor impurities or doping a P type semiconductor as done in the making of CMOS chips . A common dopant for N type semiconductors is phosphorus. In an N type semiconductor the Fermi energy level is greater than that of the intrinsic semiconductor and lies closer to the conduction band than the valence band. As opposed to N type semiconductors P type semiconductors have a larger hole concentration than electron concentration. The phrase p type refers to the positive charge of the hole. In P type semiconductors holes are the majority carriers and electrons are the minority carriers. P type semiconductors are created by doping an intrinsic semiconductor with acceptor impurities or doping an N type semiconductor . A common P type dopant is Boron. P type semiconductors have Fermi energy levels below the intrinsic Fermi energy level. The Fermi energy level lies closer to the valence band than the conduction band in a P type semiconductor.

In deriving the total system efficiency we separate the optical efficiency from the STEG efficiency. The STEG can be broken down into two subsystems the thermal absorber and the TEG. The efficiency for each subsystem can be derived individually and the STEG efficiency is simply the product of the two. The absorber efficiency is defined as the ratio of the heat transferred to the TE to the total heat that strikes the absorber surface. We must first consider the modeling of the selective absorber to determine how much of this incident heat is actually absorbed by the surface. Then the absorber efficiency is derived using heat transfer modeling to consider the conductive and radiative heat flows within the absorber and the TE leg. The thermoelectric efficiency is derived for model materials with a temperature independent zT and for real materials in a cascaded generator.

Because the use of a selective absorber increases both the cost and complexity of the STEG one could also consider using a black body as the thermal absorber. shows the net flux for a black body absorber versus the net flux for an optimized selective absorber the performance of the selective absorber is markedly better at high temperatures and low incident fluxes. compares the ratio of the net flux achieved by the black body q q to the net flux achieved with an optimized selective absorber . The difference between the black body and selective absorber fluxes is greatest at high temperatures and low incident fluxes. Because the radiative losses of the system show a Tdependence the selective absorber is necessary to prevent large radiative losses at high temperatures. At low incident fluxes the magnitudes of the incident and radiative fluxes are similar and again a selective absorber is necessary to prevent large radiative losses. In contrast at high incident fluxes the magnitude of the incident flux dwarfs that of the radiative flux and the difference between the black body and selective absorber is less pronounced.
