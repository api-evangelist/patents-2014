title: Self-aligning, compactable chair
abstract: A self-aligning, compactable, collapsible seating structure formed by sections of hollow tubing, each hollow tubing component has a first end having a first diameter and a second opposing region having a second, reduced diameter. Reduced diameter regions are insertable into said tubing regions having a first diameter to form a self-aligning joint. A pair of rigid, U-shape frames are rotatively connected together to form an A-frame shaped support. Dimensions of the chair in an operational, deployed configuration may be reduced along two dimensions (i.e., height, length) into a compacted configuration for storage or transport. The novel chair may be compacted into a thin bundle that may be rolled up in and contained within fabric that forms a portion of the chair. In its compacted, rolled up state, the novel chair is suitable for transportation within a backpack or other such enclosure.

This application is a Continuation in Part Application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 595 249 Self Aligning Compactable Chair filed August 27 2012 that is included herein in its entirety by reference.

The invention pertains to collapsible seating structures and more particularly to a chair having a light weight rigid collapsible frame having reduced dimensions in a collapsed state allowing the compacted collapsed chair to be carried in a back pack or rolled up and secured without the necessity of a bag.

Many outdoor activities are greatly enhanced by the use of a portable seat or back support structure. Many such devices have been proposed in the prior art all suffer from the limitations of bulk and or weight. While many prior art structures may be folded or collapsed for transportation or storage the rigid frames thereof typically retain at least one of their original dimensions. Consequently the frame dimensions of such prior art chairs or seats even in the folded or collapsed configuration are not reduced and the degree of compaction of such structures is thereby limited. In other words when such prior art seats are folded or collapsed they typically retain at least two e.g. height and width of their open operational dimensions. When the activity for which a seat or backrest is required occurs a distance from a transportation source the collapsed dimensions of prior art structures still present logistical problems due to their bulk when hand carrying them to the site of the activity.

Several attempts at providing portable and or collapsible seating or backrest structures may be found in the prior art. For example U.S. Pat. No. 1 799 939 for CONVERTIBLE GROUND SEAT AND LOUNGE issued Apr. 7 1931 to Claude Beauchamp Wainewright et al. discloses a portable seating structure collapsible along a single dimension.

U.S. Pat. No. 2 570 571 for COMBINATION BACK REST AND BAG STRUCTURE issued Oct. 9 1951 to Robert N. Leeman teaches another portable seating arrangement collapsible along a single dimension.

U.S. Pat. No. 2 816 599 for COMBINATION SUPPORT AND BAG issued Dec. 17 1957 to Marjory M. Adams discloses another seat backrest structure collapsible along a single dimension and having a carrying bag which in addition to facilitating carrying the ADAMS seat functions as seat and back support surfaces.

U.S. Pat. No. 4 736 825 for COMBINATION TOTE BAG AND BODY REST issued Apr. 12 1988 to Daniel P. Belfi shows another structure collapsible in a single dimension and including an integral tote bag.

U.S. Pat. No. 4 530 451 for COMBINATION BACK PACK BEACH CHAIR issued Jul. 23 1985 to James Hamilton discloses a seat back rest structure collapsible along a single dimension and having integral straps to facilitate carrying the device on one s back.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 042 874 for FOLDING BEACH LOUNGE issued Aug. 27 1991 to Daniel E. Williams teaches another portable seating device collapsible along a single dimension. Extendable portions may be withdrawn to collapse the WILLIAMS device to a predetermined size rectangular parallelepiped thereby lowering the height as well as the thickness of the lounge consequently actually allowing compression of structure size along two dimensions.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 701 979 for BAG THAT MAY BE CONVERTED INTO A FOLDING BACK REST FOR THE BEACH OR PARK issued Dec. 30 1997 to Jan Harriett Voich teaches a folding structure that may be contacted into an integral carrying bag. However the structure collapses only along a single dimension.

Published U.S. patent application No. 2004 0195891 for GROUND LOUNGER published Oct. 7 2004 upon application by Clifford Eugene Vaughan provides yet another folding structure collapsible along a single dimension

U.S. Pat. No. 6 902 230 for FOLDABLE CHILD SUPPORT DEVICE issued Jun. 7 2005 to Shun Min Chen provides a structure having frame members foldable at a mid point thereof so as to compact the structure along both height and a length dimensions.

None of the patents and published patent application taken singly or in any combination are seen to teach or suggest the novel Self Aligning Compactable Chair of the present invention.

In accordance with the present invention there is provided a self aligning compactable collapsible seating structure wherein dimensions of the chair in an operational deployed configuration may be reduced along two dimensions i.e. height length into a compacted configuration for storage or transport. The novel chair may be compacted into a thin bundle that may be rolled up in and contained within fabric that forms a portion of the chair. In its compacted rolled up state the novel chair is suitable for transportation within a backpack or other such enclosure.

It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a seating structure convertible from an operational deployed configuration to a collapsed configuration.

It is another object of the invention to provide a seating structure convertible from an operational configuration to a collapsed configuration wherein both height and length are reduced in the transformation

It is an additional object of the invention to provide a seating structure having a rigid frame that converts from an open operational configuration to a collapsed configuration.

It is an additional object of the invention to provide a seating structure having a rigid frame that is convertible from an operational configuration to a collapsed configuration the frame having no moving parts such as hinged joints or slides.

It is a further object of the invention to provide a seating structure convertible from an operational configuration to a collapsed configuration having a seat supporting portion and a back supporting portion an angle therebetween being selectively adjustable.

It is a still further object of the invention to provide a seating structure convertible from an operational configuration to a collapsed configuration having a moisture proof mat portion when in a collapsed configuration the seating structure may be rolled up within the mat portion.

It is yet another object of the invention to provide a seating structure convertible from an operational configuration to a collapsed configuration having frame members without foldable mid point joints the frame members being held in a locked configuration by an elastic band inside the frame member tubing with the frame member tubing being held together with male female connections and connectable ends with expanded and reduced sizes and with a friction fit to form an extended portion.

The present invention provides a self aligning compactable collapsible chair structure having a seat supporting portion and a back supporting portion both rotatably connected to a common top member the angle therebetween being adjustable.

Referring first to there is shown an isometric schematic view of the self aligning compactable collapsible chair of the present invention in an open operational configuration generally at reference number .

Chair has a seat leg supporting portion consisting of a seat supporting region and a leg protecting region .

A back supporting region is provided by a first ridged collapsible U shaped frame A that is hingedly connected to a second rigid collapsible U shaped frame B that supports first rigid collapsible U shaped frame A at a desired inclination by use of a flexible strap interconnecting first rigid collapsible U shaped frame A to second rigid collapsible U shaped frame B.

Referring now also to there are shown side cross sectional elevational schematic views of two embodiments of seat leg supporting region of seat .

As seen in seat supporting region is typically a padded structure with a moisture barrier forming a lower ground engaging surface. A wear resistant membrane forms an upper surface of both leg protecting region and seat supporting region . In a first embodiment a back supporting region formed by first rigid collapsible U shaped frame A and supporting region have foam pads disposed between water resistant membrane and wear resistant membrane . It will be recognized that foam pads may be implemented as a continuous single foam pad. While foam pads have been chosen for purposes of disclosure it will be recognized by those of skill in the art that many alternate materials may be substituted therefor. Consequently the invention is not considered limited to the foam pad chosen for purposes of disclosure. Rather the invention comprehends any and all suitable padding materials.

It will be further recognized that while a two ply structure consisting of moisture resistant membrane and wear resistant membrane has been shown a single ply structure may readily be substituted therefore.

As seen in an inflatable bladder and an inflation tube and valve replace foam pad of . The use of an inflatable bladder allows chair to possibly be compacted to a smaller volume than in the embodiment of having foam pad . Further inflatable bladder allows a user to adjust a degree of firmness or support of the padding provided thereby to a personal preference. Inflatable bladders and inflation tubes and valve structures are considered to be well known to those of skill in the art and are not further described herein.

A back supporting portion is attached to seat leg supporting region by a continuation of at least wear resistant membrane or wear resistant member .

Referring now to there is shown an exploded front elevational schematic view of collapsible U shaped frames and Frame defines and supports back supporting portion of chair .

Frames each have a pair of upper frame braces . Upper frame brace has a major axis not specifically identified and an upper flattened region having a through hole disposed in flattened region perpendicularly the major axis.

Upper frame brace has reduced diameter lower portion . An elastic cord retaining member is disposed within upper frame brace and retained therein by the diameter reduction proximate reduced diameter lower portion .

Elastic cord retaining member has a central through hole disposed parallel to the major axis and sized to accept an elastic cord therethrough.

An end not specifically identified of elastic cord is retained above elastic core retaining member by a knot a fastener cement or any other suitable manner shown schematically at reference number that keeps the end of elastic cord from passing through hole once secured.

Rigid collapsible U shaped frames each typically have four hollow tubular frame members . Tubular member has an upper end having a first diameter and a reduced diameter region . The first diameter at upper end being sized to receive and frictionally retain the reduced diameter portion of upper frame brace or a reduced diameter region of another hollow tubular frame members .

A U shape bottom member has a pair of opposed ends and each having a diameter sized to accommodate and frictionally retain a reduced diameter region of upper frame brace or reduced diameter region of hollow tubular frame member .

Frame members and are formed from light weight ductile metal typically aluminum. Joints formed by inserting a reduced diameter region e.g. and into a larger diameter portion of tubing e.g. forms self aligning joints. Self alignment in ensured by forming frame components so that the length of regions of reduced diameter is sufficient to cause the joint formed to be self aligning.

Referring now also to there is shown a side elevational schematic view of a top frame member . Top frame member is a straight tubular structure having a pair of opposing ends not specifically identified each receiving and retaining a plastic insert .

Referring now to there are shown a side elevational a top plan and a bottom plan schematic view respectively of plastic insert . Plastic insert has a flange having a larger diameter that the diameter of top member . A body having a diameter depends from a lower surface of flange . Body is adapted for insertion in the ends of top member .

Protrusions spaced circumferentially around body are adapted to press against an inside surface of top frame member as a screw best seen in is inserted into threaded bore and thereby slightly expanding the diameter of body and retaining plastic insert within top frame member .

Referring now also to there is shown front elevational schematic view of collapsible U shaped frames and connected to a top frame member . In the frame components shown in in an exploded view are joined to form frames in their respective operational configurations.

Top frame member is shown in its operational position between flattened regions of upper frame braces . Plastic inserts in each end of top frame member more specifically threaded through hole of plastic insert is show positioned to receive screws that will be inserted through holes in the directions shown by respective arrows adjacent each end of top frame member .

Referring now also to there is shown a front elevational schematic view of U shaped collapsible support frames in a partially collapsed state. The reduced diameter regions of upper frame braces and the reduced diameter regions of frame hollow tubular pieces have been withdrawn from respective upper ends of hollow tubular pieces and ends of U shaped bottom frame member .

Referring now also to the partially collapsed frames of are now shown in a completely collapsed arrangement. The four hollow tubular frame pieces all now lie substantially parallel to top frame member in two rows and bottom frame member has moved inwardly toward top frame member adjacent a bottom row of hollow frame tubular pieces . Once compacted the frames may be rolled up in the moisture proof barrier into a configuration suitable for carrying in a backpack or other such container.

Referring now also to there are shown a perspective schematic view of U shaped collapsible support frames assembled into an A frame structure and a detailed perspective schematic view of the frame connection region of the A frame structure of respectively.

The A frame structure that results from rotatively interconnecting U shaped collapsible support frames to one another forms the complete frame of the novel chair . The pivotable i.e. rotative interconnection of support frames is shown schematically at reference numbers .

Referring now to there is shown a perspective schematic view of the region of . Rotative interconnection of U shaped collapsible support framed is accomplished by connecting corresponding flattened regions of upper frame braces of both frames to respective ends of upper frame member .

To accomplish such interconnection A machine screw is placed into through hole in flattened region of upper support brace associated with U shaped collapsible support frame

A nylon or polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE better known as Teflon washer is placed onto the threads of machine screw . It will be recognized that materials other than polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE exist and are believed to be known to those of skill in the art from which a slippery washer may be formed. Consequently the invention is not considered limited to the nylon or polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE materials chosen for purposes of disclosure. Rather the invention is intended to include washers formed from any suitable other material.

Machine screw is then passed through hole in a corresponding upper frame brace associated with U shape collapsible support frame Finally machine screw is secured in threads of plastic insert in the associated end of upper frame member . This operation is performed on both sides of U shaped collapsible support frames thereby completely forming the A frame structure shown in .

It will be recognized that numerous mechanisms are known to those of skill in the art for pivotably interconnecting frames and Such mechanisms include but are not limited to detented mechanisms capable of self locking frames and in discrete predetermined angular relationships to one another. Such mechanisms are neither discussed nor described in further detail herein.

Flexible straps typically having one or more grommets may be used to secure the angular relationship of frames A and Flexible straps have each a proximal end rotatively connected to U shaped collapsible frame and typically contain several grommets . Grommets may be selectively placed over a screw or post in one of the hollow tubular frame pieces . By selecting the particular grommet in flexible straps the angle formed between rotatively connected U shaped collapsible support frames may be selected and maintained while chair is in use.

Back supporting flexible straps are attached to upper frame member and lower frame member of first U shaped collapsible frame At their upper ends back supporting flexible straps encircle upper fame member and the stitched together with stitching shown schematically at reference number .

At their lower ends back supporting flexible straps utilize a hook and loop fastening material with a hook portion and loop portion disposed on a first major surface of back supporting flexible straps and a mating loop portion disposed on an opposing major surface of back supporting straps . This arrangement allows back supporting flexible straps to be tightened once the angle not specifically identified between first U shape rigid frame and second U shaped rigid frame is established and maintained by straps .

Refer now again also to and . In operation compactable collapsible chair may be transformed from an operational configuration to a collapsed configuration by first unfastening straps .

If the chair configuration includes an inflatable bladder it may be necessary to deflate inflatable bladder prior to unfastening straps .

Corresponding frame hollow members of frames and may be pushed inwardly toward the center of respective frames and until the frames are totally collapsed.

Once collapsed the compacted structure may be rolled up in the moisture proof barrier into a configuration suitable for carrying in a backpack or other such container.

Since other modifications and changes varied to fit particular operating requirements and environments will be apparent to those skilled in the art the invention is not considered limited to the example chosen for purposes of disclosure and covers all changes and modifications which do not constitute departures from the true spirit and scope of this invention.

Having thus described the invention what is desired to be protected by Letters Patent is presented in the subsequently appended claims.
