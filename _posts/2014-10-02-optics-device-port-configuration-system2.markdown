title: Optics device port configuration system
abstract: An optics device port configuration system includes a switch. A first optics device and a second optics device are connected to the switch. A cable connects the first optics device and the second optics device to provide a link. The switch determines that an optics type of the first optics device is unavailable. In response, the switch applies each of a plurality of fiber optics configurations on the switch until either the link becomes available or each of the fiber optics configurations have been applied without the link becoming available. In response to each of the fiber optics configurations having been applied without the link becoming available, the switch applies each a plurality of copper optics configurations on the switch until the link becomes available. In response to the link becoming available, the switch provides at least one setting on the switch until errors are not occurring on the link.

The present disclosure relates generally to information handling systems and more particularly to a configuration system for optics devices in an information handling system.

As the value and use of information continues to increase individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option is an information handling system IHS . An IHS generally processes compiles stores and or communicates information or data for business personal or other purposes. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements may vary between different applications IHSs may also vary regarding what information is handled how the information is handled how much information is processed stored or communicated and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed stored or communicated. The variations in IHSs allow for IHSs to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing airline reservations enterprise data storage or global communications. In addition IHSs may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process store and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems data storage systems and networking systems.

Some IHSs such as for example switch IHSs utilize optics devices such as for example small form factor pluggable SFP optics devices enhanced SFP SFP optics devices and quad SFP QSFP optics devices that are compact hot pluggable transceivers that connect to ports on the switch IHS in order to provide for for example telecommunication and data communication applications. In general the port on the switch IHS to which the optics device is connected is configured in order to work properly with its connected optics device without link issues or packet cyclic redundancy check CRC issues. Conventionally the settings that allow the optics device to work properly e.g. Software receive loss of signal SwRXLOS settings interface type settings pre emphasis settings etc. on the port of the switch IHS are retrieved by reading an optics type from an electronically erasable programmable read only memory EEPROM in the optics device and using that optics type to retrieve those settings for use in configuring the port. However if an optics device with an EEPROM that has not been programmed or that has been corrupted is provided in the port of the switch IHS link issues and packet CRC issues will typically result as without the optics type from the EEPROM the switch IHS will not be able to determine the correct settings to configure its port for that optics device. As such optics devices with unprogrammed or corrupted EEPROMs are unusable and typically must be replaced.

According to one embodiment an information handling system IHS includes a plurality of ports a processing system that is coupled to the plurality of ports a memory system that is coupled to the processing system and that includes instructions that when executed by the processing system cause the processing system to detect a first optics device that is coupled to a first port of the plurality of ports and that provides a link between the first port and a second port of the plurality of ports determine that an optics type of the first optics device is unavailable apply each of a plurality of fiber optics configurations to the first port until either the link becomes available or each of the plurality of fiber optics configurations have been applied without the link becoming available in response to each of the plurality of fiber optics configurations having been applied without the link becoming available apply each a plurality of copper optics configurations to the first port until the link becomes available and in response to the link becoming available provide at least one setting on the first port until errors are not occurring on the link.

For purposes of this disclosure an IHS may include any instrumentality or aggregate of instrumentalities operable to compute classify process transmit receive retrieve originate switch store display manifest detect record reproduce handle or utilize any form of information intelligence or data for business scientific control entertainment or other purposes. For example an IHS may be a personal computer a PDA a consumer electronic device a display device or monitor a network server or storage device a switch router or other network communication device or any other suitable device and may vary in size shape performance functionality and price. The IHS may include memory one or more processing resources such as a central processing unit CPU or hardware or software control logic. Additional components of the IHS may include one or more storage devices one or more communications ports for communicating with external devices as well as various input and output I O devices such as a keyboard a mouse and a video display. The IHS may also include one or more buses operable to transmit communications between the various hardware components.

In one embodiment IHS includes a processor which is connected to a bus . Bus serves as a connection between processor and other components of IHS . An input device is coupled to processor to provide input to processor . Examples of input devices may include keyboards touchscreens pointing devices such as mouses trackballs and trackpads and or a variety of other input devices known in the art. Programs and data are stored on a mass storage device which is coupled to processor . Examples of mass storage devices may include hard discs optical disks magneto optical discs solid state storage devices and or a variety other mass storage devices known in the art. IHS further includes a display which is coupled to processor by a video controller . A system memory is coupled to processor to provide the processor with fast storage to facilitate execution of computer programs by processor . Examples of system memory may include random access memory RAM devices such as dynamic RAM DRAM synchronous DRAM SDRAM solid state memory devices and or a variety of other memory devices known in the art. In an embodiment a chassis houses some or all of the components of IHS . It should be understood that other buses and intermediate circuits can be deployed between the components described above and processor to facilitate interconnection between the components and the processor .

Referring now to an embodiment of a switch IHS is illustrated. In an embodiment the switch IHS may be the IHS discussed above with reference to and or may include some or all of the components of the IHS . The switch IHS includes a switch IHS chassis that houses the components of the switch IHS which in the illustrated embodiment include a central processing system e.g. one or more central processing units CPUs a network processing system e.g. one or more network processing units NPUs and a configuration database . While a few components are illustrated one of skill in the art will recognize that a variety of other components may be included in the switch IHS while remaining within the scope of the present disclosure. For example a memory system not illustrated but which may include one or more memory devices may be included in the switch IHS chassis coupled to the central processing system and or network processing system and may include instructions that when executed by the central processing system and or network processing system cause the central processing system and or network processing system to provide the functionality of the switch IHS discussed below. In the illustrated embodiment the network processing system is coupled to each of the central processing system and the configuration database as well as to a plurality of ports and that are partially housed in the switch IHS chassis and accessible on an outer surface of the switch IHS chassis . However the illustrated embodiment is merely provided as an example of a switch IHS according the teachings of the present disclosure and one of skill in the art in possession of the present disclosure will recognize that a wide variety of connections and configurations of components in the switch IHS will fall within the scope of the present disclosure.

In the embodiments discussed below with reference to the central processing system performs functions such as for example booting initializing the network processing system and processing control data traffic for the switch IHS while the network processing system performs functions such as for example the auto configuration of any of the plurality of ports that are connected to an optics device as discussed below. However one of skill in the art in possession of the present disclosure will recognize that the functionality of the central processing system and the network processing system may be switched reallocated combined and or otherwise modified while remaining within the scope of the present disclosure. Furthermore the configuration database is described below as a single database that is located in the switch IHS chassis and that stores configurations and settings for automatically configuring any of the plurality of ports that are connected to an optics device but one of skill in the art in possession of the present disclosure will recognize that any of the information discussed below as being stored in the configuration database may be distributed across multiple databases and or may be accessible by the switch IHS over a network i.e. stored on a device that is connected to the switch IHS through the network .

Referring now to an embodiment of a method for providing a configuration for an optics device is illustrated. As discussed above conventional configuration systems for optics devices may involve reading information from an EEPROM e.g. defined as per small form factor SFF industry standards SFF 8472 for SFP and SFF 8436 for QSFP in the optics devices that may include an optics type e.g. a short range SR4 optics type an extended range ER4 optics type a long range LR4 optics type etc. . In addition some optics devices may include a read only customizable location in the EEPROM e.g. a manufacturers proprietary ID section in which optics manufacturers provide optics device operation parameters such as wavelength and distance values and conventional configuration systems for such optics devices may include reading the wavelength and distance values from the manufacturers proprietary ID section to retrieve and or determine the optics type. In such conventional configuration systems if the manufacturers proprietary ID section is not present the optics type page 00 address 131 according to the SFF 8436 industry standard for the EEPROM may be read to retrieve the optics type.

As discussed above if an optics device that includes an EEPROM that has not been programmed or that has been corrupted is provided in the port of the switch IHS link issues and packet CRC issues will typically result as without the optics type from the EEPROM the switch IHS may not be able to determine the correct settings to configure its port for that optics device. Without the correct settings on the port a link associated with the port may not become available packet cyclic redundancy check CRC errors may occur link flap errors may occur and or data packets may be lost. In a specific example a long range optics device e.g. utilizing LR4 optics devices may require the supply of a relatively high power through its connected port in order to transmit data over a long range link but the port settings may default to the provision of relatively low power to reduce power consumption of the switch IHS and thus if no optics type is can be retrieved from the long range optics device then the system will not be able to provide a high power setting and as a result the link will not operate correctly.

As such optics designers who create new optics devices without programmed EEPROMs have trouble testing those optics devices with conventional switch IHSs and optics devices with corrupted EEPROMs must typically be discarded and replaced with optics devices that have programmed and uncorrupted EEPROMs. The method describes the operation of a switch IHS e.g. the switch IHS discussed above with reference to that functions to automatically configure a port that is connected to an optics device without any knowledge of the optics type of that optics device and as such optics devices with unprogrammed or corrupted EEPROMs may be used with that switch IHS.

Referring now to the method begins at block where optics device are detected. illustrates an optics device configuration system that includes an optics device coupled to the port on the switch IHS of an optics device coupled to the port on the switch IHS and a cable coupled to each of the optics devices and to provide a link between the ports and on the switch IHS . The optics devices and have the same optics type. In some of the embodiments discussed below the optics devices and are described as 40 Gbps fiber optics devices such as for example SR4 fiber optics devices ER4 fiber optics devices and LR4 fiber optics devices. However the optics devices and may be variety of other fiber optics devices known in the art that operate at different ranges different speeds and or that exhibit other optic device characteristics. In a specific example the use of an extra long range optics device such as a ZR optics device rated for 80 kilometers may require the use of an attenuator on the switch IHS to ensure that the optics device at the other end of the link is not damaged due to the relatively high power used in operating the ZR optics device.

In some of the embodiments discussed below the optics devices and are described as 40 Gbps copper optics devices such as for example for example copper CR4 direct attach cable DAC optics devices and CR4 DAC fanout optics devices. However the optics devices and may be a variety of other copper optics devices known in the art that operate at different ranges different speeds and or exhibit other optic device characteristics. While a few examples of fiber optics devices and copper optics devices have been provided one of skill in the art in possession of the present disclosure will recognize that the teachings of the present disclosure will be beneficial to a wide variety of fiber optics devices and copper optics devices known in the art and thus such optics devices will fall within its scope. The cable that couples to each of the optics devices and to provide the link between the ports and may thus be a wide variety of fiber optics or copper optics compatible cables known in the art and the selection of the type of the cable will depend on the type of the optics devices and .

While the optics device configuration system is illustrated as including a single optics device connected to another single optics device by the cable other types of optics device systems will fall within the scope of the present disclosure. In an embodiment the optics device may be included on first end of a breakout fanout cabling system that has a plurality of optics devices located on a plurality of second ends of the breakout fanout cabling system with cabling that connects each of the optics devices to the optics device . For example a 4 10 G breakout fanout cabling system provides a 40 Gbps optics device on one end and four 10 Gbps optics device connected to the 40 Gbps optics device by cabling. Such optics device systems will benefit from the teachings of the present disclosure and thus will fall within its scope. As such the embodiment illustrated in may be characterized as illustrating one of a plurality of similar optics devices that are connected to the optics device through the cable .

In the embodiments discussed below the optics device includes an unprogrammed or corrupted EEPROM such that an optics type for the optics device is not retrievable from its EEPROM. As discussed below in some embodiments the optics device may include a programmed EEPROM such that an optics type for the optics device is retrievable from its EEPROM while in other embodiments the optics device may include an unprogrammed or corrupted EEPROM such that an optics type for the optics device is not retrievable from its EEPROM. As discussed below when the EEPROM of the optics device is programmed such that its optics type can be retrieved the switch IHS operates to configure the port using that optics type and the method determines a configuration for the port In addition when the EEPROM of the optics device is programmed such that its optics type can be retrieved the optics device may be connected to the same switch IHS or a different switch IHS than the optics device . However when the when the EEPROM of the optics device is unprogrammed or corrupted such that its optics type cannot be retrieved the optics device is connected to the same switch IHS as the optics device . When the EEPROM of the optics device is unprogrammed or corrupted such that its optics type cannot be retrieved the method may duplicate any configuration discussed below on each of the ports and

Thus at block a user may have connected each of the optics devices and to the ports and respectively on the switch IHS with the optics devices and connected to each other using the cable . At block the network processing system detects the connection of the optics devices and using methods known in the art. The method then proceeds to decision block where it is determined whether an optics type is available from the optics devices. In an embodiment at decision block the network processing system accesses the EEPROM in each of the optics devices and and attempts to retrieve an optics type. If at decision block it is determined that an optics type is available in the EEPROM of an optics device e.g. in an embodiment where the optics device includes a programmed and uncorrupted EEPROM such that an optics type is retrievable the method proceeds to block where port s are configured based on the optics type. In an embodiment the network processing system may operate at block to configure the port e.g. the port connected to the optics device e.g. the optics device from which the optics type was retrieved using conventional methods some of which are described above. In embodiments in which both optics devices and have programmed and uncorrupted EEPROMs such that optics types may be retrieved and their corresponding ports and configured the link between the ports and will become available and the method may proceed to block where the user is notified that the link is available.

If at decision block it is determined that an optics type is unavailable in the EEPROM of either of the optics devices e.g. in the optics device and in some embodiments the optics device the method proceeds to blocks where fiber configurations settings and in some embodiments copper configurations settings are applied to the port and in some embodiments the port until the link provided between the ports and by the cable and the optics devices and becomes available. As such while the discussion of providing configurations settings to port s below is directed to the application of configurations settings to only the port that discussion may include the provision of the same configurations settings to both of the ports and

There are a variety of configurations and settings that may be applied to ports on the switch IHS and any of those configurations and settings may be stored in the configuration database . Fiber configurations may include an SR4 fiber configuration an ER4 fiber configuration an LR4 fiber configuration and or a variety of other port fiber configurations known in the art. Particular fiber configurations may include a variety of settings for a port that may differ from the settings for other fiber configurations. For example a port with an ER4 fiber configuration may have its auto negotiation setting s disabled its SwRXLOS setting s enabled its SR4 interface type setting s enabled and its pre emphasis setting s enabled. In another example a port with an LR4 fiber configuration may include the same setting s as discussed above for the port with the ER4 fiber configuration but with its high power mode setting s enabled. Copper configurations may include a CR4 DAC copper configuration a CR4 DAC fanout copper configuration and or a variety of other copper configurations known in the art. Similarly as with the fiber configurations particular copper configurations may include a variety of settings for a port that may differ from the settings for other copper configurations. For example a port with a CR4 DAC copper configuration may have its auto negotiation setting s enabled if a connected port e.g. the other port providing the link supports auto negotiation its SwRXLOS setting s disabled its CR4 interface type setting s enabled and its pre emphasis setting s enabled. In another example a port with a CR4 DAC fanout copper configuration may have its Serdes Framer Interface SFI interface type setting s enabled and its pre emphasis setting s enabled. While a few examples have been provided one of skill in the art in possession of the present disclosure will recognize that a configuration may include any number of settings for a port that provide for proper operation of the port with a connected optics device in order to provide a link.

A variety of settings may be provided on a port just some of which are discussed below. Speed settings may be provided to configure the data transmission speed of a port. Auto negotiation settings may be provided to allow a port to select common transmission parameters with a connected port. Medium dependent interface crossover MDI X settings may be provided to allow a port to detect if a link requires a crossover and select a configuration to match a connected port. Interface type settings may be provided to apply predefined configurations to the port and classify the port in a particular category e.g. ports connected to 40 Gbps fiber optics devices such as SR4 ER4 and LR4 fiber optics devices may utilize interface type SR4 while ports connected to copper optics devices may utilize interface type CR4 . Firmware mode settings may be provided along with the port interface type settings as the two are interrelated. Software receive loss of signal SwRXLOS settings may be provided to handle situations through software when no reliable LOS detect is available and provides for a receiver reset whenever the link is brought up SwRXLOS may only be provided on internal PHYs associated with a port coupled to a fiber optics device . Repeater settings also called synchronous mode operation settings may be provided to configure the egress of a port to operate synchronously to the media access control MAC clock to reduce packet latency. Squelch settings may be provided to bring down a transmitter receptor TX RX when the clock data recovery CDR signal is not locked or when the link status is down. PHY Long XFI settings may be provided when a relatively long cable 5 7 meters is used with an external PHY device with a 10 Gigabit Small Form Factor Pluggable XFP interface XFI as XFI cannot drive long distance cables by default and instead needs TX pre emphasis to be adjusted. Electronic dispersion compensation EDC settings may be provided to compensate for intersymbol interference resulting from high data transmission rates electrically using high speed equalizers. Lane Swap and Polarity settings may be provided to ensure link and traffic work. Pre emphasis settings may be provided to provide emphasis on certain parts of the signal waveform in order to improve waveform quality on XFI XLAUI SFI PPI signals. While a few types of settings are discussed above one of skill in the art in possession of the present disclosure will recognize that a wide variety of other port settings may be provided on a port and will fall within the scope of the present disclosure some of which are introduced below.

In an embodiment the method first proceeds to block where a fiber configuration is applied. In this embodiment the switch IHS first assumes the optics device is a fiber optics device and applies a fiber configuration to the port in an attempt bring up or otherwise make available the link provided between the ports and For example in an embodiment of block the network processing system may retrieve an SR4 fiber configuration from the configuration database and apply that SR4 fiber configuration to the port As discussed above the SR4 fiber configuration may include a variety of settings for the port that will allow an SR4 fiber optics device to provide an operating link. The method then proceeds to decision block where it is determined whether the link provided between the ports and is available. Continuing with the example of first applying the SR4 fiber configuration the network processing system may determine whether the application of the SR4 fiber configuration to the port resulted in the link becoming available using a variety of different methods. For example the network processing system may determine that Normal Link Pulse NLP signals e.g. during an idle state are being exchanged at the ports and and in response determine that the link has become available. Similarly the lack of NLP signal exchange at the ports and may result in a determination that the link is not available. In another example with ports capable of auto negotiation the network processing system may determine that Fast Link Pulse NLP signals are being exchanged at the ports and and in response determine that the link has become available. Similarly the lack of FLP signal exchange at the ports and may result in a determination that the link is not available. In another example the network processing system may include a software development kit SDK that includes an application programming interface API that allows the network processing system to read the link availability or if the link is not available e.g. the APIs read the registers in the network processing system to find the link status of MAC and PHY layers and if both are up it may be determined that the link is available.

In some embodiments if the link is not available subsequent to the application of the SR4 fiber configuration to the port the network processing system may check whether at the signal level the link is operating e.g. in all four lanes of a 40 Gbps port . For example a 40 Gbps port may include four 10 Gbps lanes and the network processing system may determine whether any of those lanes are unavailable or down using APIs to determine whether signals on those lanes are blocked. If at decision block it is determined that the link is not available the method then proceeds to decision block where it is determined whether other fiber configurations are available. In an embodiment the network processing system checks the configuration database to determine whether other fiber configurations are available.

If at decision block it is determined that other fiber configurations are available the method proceeds back through block and decision block where one of those other fiber configurations are applied to the port to determine whether they cause the link to become available. For example following the application of the SR4 fiber configuration to the port and the subsequent unavailability of the link on a first pass through block and decision block the network processing system may determine at decision block that the ER4 fiber configuration and the LR4 fiber configuration are available in the configuration database and return to block . In some embodiments of the second pass through block and decision block the network processing system may retrieve the ER4 fiber configuration from the configuration database apply it to the port and determine whether the link becomes available. As discussed above the ER4 fiber configuration may include a variety of settings for the port that will allow an ER4 fiber optics device to provide an operating link. However in other embodiments of the second pass through block and decision block the network processing system may retrieve the LR4 fiber configuration apply it to the port and determine whether the link becomes available e.g. because the ER4 fiber configuration is sufficiently similar to the SR4 fiber configuration such that unavailability of the link with the SR4 configuration applied indicates that the link will remain unavailable if the ER4 configuration is applied . As discussed above the LR4 fiber configuration may include a variety of settings for the port that will allow an LR4 fiber optics device to provide an operating link. In embodiments where the ER4 fiber configuration is applied to the port and the link does not become available on the second pass through block and decision block the network processing system may determine at decision block that the LR4 fiber configuration is available in the configuration database and return for a third pass through block and decision block in which the LR4 fiber configuration is applied to the port to determine whether the link becomes available. As such any number of fiber configurations that are available in the configuration database may be retrieved and applied to the port during the performance of blocks of the method .

If at decision block it is determined that no other fiber configurations are available the method then proceeds to block where copper configurations are applied. In this embodiment following the application of one or more fiber configurations in the configuration database to the port without the link becoming available the switch IHS now assumes the optics device is a copper optics device and applies copper configurations to the port in an attempt bring up or otherwise make available the link provided between the ports and For example in an embodiment of block the network processing system may retrieve a CR4 DAC copper configuration from the configuration database and apply that CR4 DAC copper configuration to the port As discussed above the CR4 DAC copper configuration may include a variety of settings for the port that will allow an CR4 DAC copper optics device to provide an operating link. The method then proceeds to decision block where it is determined whether the link provided between the ports and is available. Continuing with the example of first applying the CR4 DAC copper configuration the network processing system may determine whether the application of the CR4 DAC copper configuration to the port resulted in the link becoming available using methods similar to those described above. If at decision block it is determined that the link is not available the method then proceeds to decision block where it is determined whether other copper configurations are available. In an embodiment the network processing system checks the configuration database to determine whether any other copper configurations are available.

If at decision block it is determined that other copper configurations are available the method proceeds back through block and decision block where those copper configurations are applied to the port to determine whether they cause the link to become available. For example following the application of the CR4 DAC copper configuration to the port and the subsequent unavailability of the link on a first pass through block and decision block the network processing system may determine at decision block that the CR4 DAC fanout copper configuration is available and return to block . In some embodiments of the second pass through block and decision block the network processing system may apply the CR4 DAC fanout copper configuration to the port and determine whether the link becomes available. As discussed above the CR4 DAC fanout copper configuration may include a variety of settings for the port that will allow an CR4 DAC fanout copper optics device to provide an operating link. If at decision block it is determined that no other copper configurations are available the method proceeds to block where the user is notified about the link. In this embodiment none of the fiber configurations and copper configurations that are available in the configuration database resulted in the link becoming available when applied to the port and as such at block the user may be notified that the link is unavailable with the optics device .

The method may proceed to decision block following the link becoming available in response to either the application of a fiber configuration to the port or the application of a copper configuration to the port A link that has become available e.g. as determined at decision block or decision block may be validated by the network processing system by reading the MAC and PHY level status on both the local and remote ends of the link e.g. at the ports and . Following the link becoming available in either situation the port settings associated with the applied configuration may be cross verified by checking for errors and if errors are present provision modifying and or adjusting settings on the ports until the errors are not occurring on the link. In the embodiments discussed below these errors are discusses as link flap errors i.e. when the link continually switches between being available and being unavailable and cyclic redundancy check CRC errors but the provision modifying and or adjustment of other settings to remedy other errors occurring on the link will fall within the scope of the present disclosure.

In some embodiments the link becomes available at decision block or decision block and at decision block it is determined whether link flap errors exist. In an embodiment the network processing system may monitor the link that was determined to be available at block to detect link flap errors by monitoring that link to determine whether the link repeatedly becomes available and unavailable e.g. more than five times in ten seconds . If at decision block link flap errors are determined to exist the method proceeds to block where link flap errors are corrected. In this embodiment the network processing system may correct link flap errors by applying SwRXLOS setting s e.g. enabling SxRXLOS on the port e.g. via an internal PHY .

Following the correction of link flap errors at block or if no link flap errors are detected at decision block the method then proceeds to block where traffic is provided on the link. In an embodiment the network processing system may utilize a packet generator at block to generate bidirectional data traffic between the ports and and over the link. The method then proceeds to decision block where it is determined whether CRC errors are detected. In an embodiment the network processing system may utilize a packet counter to check a frame check sequence FCS packet count to determine whether packets transmitted between the ports and have CRC errors. If at decision block it is determined that CRC errors are detected the method proceeds to block where pre emphasis settings are adjusted. In an embodiment the network processing system may adjust the pre emphasis settings on the port e.g. the pre values the post values and the main values until the traffic transmitted between the ports and and over the link is free of CRC errors.

Following the adjustment of the pre emphasis settings at block or if no CRC errors are detected at decision block the method then proceeds to block where the user is notified about the link. In this embodiment the link is available and any errors that were occurring on the link have been remedied and as such at block the user may be notified that the link is available.

Thus systems and methods have been described that provide for the automatic configuration of a port that is connected to an optics device from which an optics type cannot be retrieved. The systems and methods operate by applying fiber configurations to the port and if the link associated with the port becomes available in response to the application of one of those fiber configurations link flap errors may be corrected by enabling a SxRXLOS setting on the port and CRC errors may be detected by providing traffic on the link and then remedied by adjusting pre emphasis settings on the port. If none of the applied fiber configurations result in the link becoming available copper configurations may be applied to the port and if the link associated with the port becomes available in response to the application of one of those copper configurations link flap errors and CRC errors may be remedied in similar manners. Upon failure of the link to become available after applying configurations and settings to the port the configurations and settings on the port may revert back to default configurations and settings such that optics devices that are not compatible with those settings will not be damaged when coupled to the port.

Although illustrative embodiments have been shown and described a wide range of modification change and substitution is contemplated in the foregoing disclosure and in some instances some features of the embodiments may be employed without a corresponding use of other features. Accordingly it is appropriate that the appended claims be construed broadly and in a manner consistent with the scope of the embodiments disclosed herein.
