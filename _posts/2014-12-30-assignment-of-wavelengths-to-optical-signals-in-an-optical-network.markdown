Wavelength division multiplexed WDM optical communication systems referred to as WDM systems are systems in which multiple optical signals each having a different wavelength are combined onto a single optical fiber using an optical multiplexer circuit referred to as a multiplexer . Such systems may include a transmitter circuit such as a transmitter Tx photonic integrated circuit PIC having a transmitter component to provide a laser associated with each wavelength a modulator configured to modulate the output of the laser and a multiplexer to combine each of the modulated outputs e.g. to form a combined output or WDM signal which may be collectively integrated onto a common semiconductor substrate.

A WDM system may also include a receiver circuit such as a receiver Rx PIC having a photodiode and an optical demultiplexer circuit referred to as a demultiplexer configured to receive the combined output and demultiplex the combined output into individual optical signals.

For example the WDM system may include a set of reconfigurable optical add drop multiplexers ROADMs .

A wavelength of an optical signal output from the Tx PIC may be utilized to transmit information at a fixed data rate. However multiple optical signals may be combined into a unified channel that facilitates transmission of information at a higher data rate e.g. a super channel . The multiple optical signals may or may not be contiguous with respect to the wavelength spectrum. One or more sets of optical signals may be associated into one or more super channels for independent routing through a network.

The wavelength identifier graph may include a set of vertices corresponding to the set of optical signals and a set of edges corresponding to the first set of lightpath conflicts and the second set of lightpath conflicts. The apparatus may select an optical signal from the set of optical signals based on the wavelength identifier graph. The apparatus may selectively assign a wavelength identifier of a set of wavelength identifiers to the optical signal based on the wavelength identifier graph. The wavelength identifier of the set of wavelength identifiers may correspond to a wavelength of a set of wavelengths. The apparatus may cause the optical signal to utilize the wavelength of the set of wavelengths for transmission via one or more super channels of the optical network.

The following detailed description of example implementations refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.

An optical transmitter associated with a wavelength division multiplexed WDM optical communication system may transmit multiple optical signals via a single optical communication path using an optical multiplexer circuit. The optical transmitter may provide the multiple optical signals along one or more wavelengths via one or more super channels. The optical transmitter may transmit the one or more super channels that include the multiple optical signals to a receive node which may include an optical receiver of a network. When an optical signal is added dropped at a node of the network wavelengths at which a set of optical signals are to be transmitted received may be re assigned among the set of optical signals.

The optical signals that are transmitted via an optical communication path e.g. an optical fiber a link or the like may be assigned different wavelengths to avoid a fiber lightpath conflict a photonic integrated circuit PIC lightpath conflict or the like. A conflict e.g. multiple optical signals utilizing the same wavelength via the same optical communication path may cause signal degradation erroneous data reception or the like. A fiber lightpath conflict may occur when an optical signal within a super channel is added to an optical communication path that already includes another optical signal with the same wavelength. A PIC lightpath conflict may occur when an optical signal which is being transmitted from to a particular PIC conflicts with another optical signal which is being transmitted from to the particular PIC. An optical signal may include a tunability constraint a routability constraint or another similar constraint. A tunability constraint may refer to a set of wavelengths to which a transmitter receiver PIC associated with transmitting receiving the optical signal may tune. A routability constraint may refer to a restraint on a quantity of directions on which a set of optical signals transmitted by received from a PIC may be routed.

Implementations described herein may facilitate adding dropping an optical signal of a super channel by a reconfigurable optical add drop multiplexer ROADM without adding and or dropping one or more other optical signals of the super channel. Additionally or alternatively implementations described herein may facilitate a wavelength assignment for a set of optical signals being transmitted via a super channel that avoids a fiber lightpath conflict a PIC lightpath conflict or the like and that accords with a tunability constraint a routability constraint and or another similar constraint.

With respect to the network management device may determine a logical topology for the network that identifies a set of fiber lightpath conflicts a set of PIC lightpath conflicts or the like associated with the network. For example the network management device may determine that the Tx PIC associated with the ROADM of Node A may transmit OS and OS via fiber path potentially causing fiber lightpath conflict . Similarly the network management device may determine that other fiber paths may be associated with a potential fiber lightpath conflict e.g. fiber path f with potential lightpath conflict fiber path f with potential lightpath conflict and fiber path f with potential lightpath conflict . Additionally or alternatively the network management device may determine that OS OS and OS may be transmitted received via a Tx PIC Rx PIC associated with the ROADM of Node B potentially causing PIC lightpath conflict . Similarly the network management device may determine that other nodes may be associated with a potential PIC lightpath conflict e.g. Node A with Node C with Node D with and Node E with .

With respect to the network management device may generate a wavelength identifier graph representing the logical topology of the optical signals. An optical signal of the set of optical signals may be represented by a vertex of the wavelength identifier graph. A lightpath conflict e.g. a potential fiber lightpath conflict a potential PIC lightpath conflict or the like of the set of lightpath conflicts may be represented by an edge of the wavelength identifier graph. A particular edge associated with a particular lightpath conflict may connect to a pair of vertices associated with a pair of optical signals. An edge may be associated with multiple lightpath conflicts. For example a first edge associated with and a second edge associated with would both connect to a pair of vertices associated with OS and OS because is associated with f which carries OS and OS and is associated with Node E which transmits OS and OS . In this case the first edge and the second edge may be consolidated into a single edge e.g. represented as .

With respect to the network management device may select a particular vertex for wavelength assignment and may select a wavelength identifier such that the particular vertex is not assigned the same wavelength identifier as another vertex with which the particular vertex shares an edge. In other words an optical signal of a super channel associated with a vertex may be assigned a wavelength for transmission via the super channel so that a lightpath conflict does not result in interference with another optical signal of the super channel. The network management device may determine whether the wavelength associated with the wavelength identifier is tunable by a Tx PIC of a first ROADM associated with transmitting the particular optical signal and an Rx PIC of a second ROADM associated with receiving the particular optical signal. The network management device may determine whether the wavelength is routable based on a limited degrees of routability for the Tx PIC and the Rx PIC. If the wavelength of the particular optical signal conflicts with the wavelength of another optical signal is not tunable and or is not routable the network management device may select another available wavelength identifier associated with another wavelength. If no other wavelength identifier is available the network management device may assign the optical signal to another PIC e.g. another Tx PIC of the first ROADM another Rx PIC of the second ROADM or the like and may update the wavelength identifier graph e.g. to remove the optical signal from the wavelength identifier graph to remove lightpath conflicts associated therewith or the like . If the wavelength does not conflict with the wavelength of another optical signal is tunable and is routable the network management device may assign the wavelength to the particular optical signal and may perform wavelength assignment for one or more other optical signals e.g. iteratively until wavelength assignment is complete.

In this way a network management device may efficiently perform wavelength assignment that accords with constraints on tunability and routability for a set of optical signals that may be added and or dropped by a ROADM at a node of a network.

In some implementations network management device may utilize a particular algorithm e.g. Brelaz s algorithm to perform wavelength assignment based on the wavelength identifier graph as discussed in detail with regards to . In some implementations network management device may perform an initial wavelength assignment and may determine whether the initial wavelength assignment satisfies a set of criteria e.g. a routability criteria a tunability criteria or the like . For example network management device may utilize Brelaz s algorithm to initially assign a set of wavelength identifiers to a set of optical signals. Additionally or alternatively network management device may perform wavelength assignment without an initial assignment. For example network management device may select an optical signal from a set of optical signals according to a set of selection criteria may assign a wavelength identifier to the optical signal e.g. according to Brelaz s algorithm according to a set of assignment criteria such as saturation degree quantity of unassigned neighbors or the like and may confirm that the wavelength identifier assignment does not violate any constraints. In this case network management device may select one or more other optical signals from the set of optical signals for wavelength assignment until network management device has performed wavelength assignment for each optical signal of the set of optical signals.

As shown in process may include selecting an optical signal for wavelength assignment block . For example network management device may select the optical signal from the set of optical signals for wavelength assignment. In some implementations network management device may select the optical signal based on a saturation degree of the optical signal. Saturation degree may refer to a quantity of unique wavelength identifiers assigned to neighboring vertices of the vertex associated with the optical signal. For example network management device may determine that a vertex of the wavelength identifier graph is neighbored by a first neighboring vertex associated with a first wavelength identifier a second neighboring vertex associated with the first wavelength identifier and a third neighboring vertex associated with a second wavelength identifier. In this case network management device may determine that for the purposes of determining a saturation degree the vertex of the wavelength identifier graph is associated with neighboring vertices having two unique wavelength identifiers. In some implementations network management device may select a particular optical signal associated with a vertex e.g. of a set of vertices that are not assigned that is associated with the highest saturation degree compared with the set of vertices that are not assigned e.g. that have not been assigned a wavelength identifier corresponding to a wavelength .

Additionally or alternatively network management device may select the optical signal based on a degree of the vertex associated with the optical signal. A degree of the vertex may refer to a quantity of edges of the wavelength identifier graph that touch the vertex. For example when a vertex is associated with a set of three edges network management device may determine that the degree of the vertex is three. In some implementations network management device may select a particular optical signal associated with a vertex that is associated with the highest degree of the vertex compared with a set of other vertices of the wavelength identifier graph that are not assigned.

Additionally or alternatively network management device may select the optical signal based on a quantity of unassigned neighbors of the vertex associated with the optical signal. A quantity of unassigned neighbors refers to the quantity of neighboring vertices to a vertex that have not been assigned a wavelength identifier during wavelength assignment. For example when a vertex is connected by a first edge to a first vertex associated with a first wavelength identifier a second edge to a second vertex that has not been assigned a wavelength identifier and a third edge to a third vertex associated with a second wavelength identifier network management device may determine that the vertex is associated with one unassigned neighbor. In some implementations network management device may select a particular optical signal associated with a vertex that is associated with the greatest quantity of unassigned neighbors compared with a set of vertices that are not assigned. Additionally or alternatively network management device may select the particular optical signal based on the particular optical signal being associated with the greatest quantity of unassigned neighbors that share a PIC lightpath conflict with the optical signal.

As further shown in process may include selecting a wavelength identifier to assign to the optical signal block . For example network management device may select a wavelength identifier from a set of wavelength identifiers. The wavelength identifier may correspond to a wavelength of a set of wavelengths. In some implementations network management device may select the wavelength identifier based on an ordering of the set of wavelength identifiers. For example network management device may order the set of wavelength identifiers based on corresponding wavelength bandwidth e.g. of a channel associated with a particular corresponding wavelength through put e.g. of a channel associated with a particular corresponding wavelength or the like and may select the wavelength identifier based on a selection criteria such as selecting a wavelength identifier associated with the lowest corresponding wavelength the greatest corresponding wavelength or the like. In some implementations network management device may select the wavelength identifier based on an assignment algorithm such as Brelaz s algorithm or the like.

As further shown in process may include determining whether the selected wavelength identifier conflicts with another optical signal block . For example network management device may determine whether the selected wavelength identifier conflicts with another wavelength identifier assigned to another vertex associated with another optical signal. In some implementations the selected wavelength identifier may conflict with another wavelength identifier if the vertex to which the selected wavelength identifier is assigned shares an edge with another vertex that is assigned the same wavelength identifier. For example if network management device assigns a first wavelength identifier to a first vertex that shares an edge with a second vertex that is assigned the first wavelength identifier network management device may determine that the selected wavelength identifier conflicts with another optical signal.

As further shown in if the selected wavelength identifier does not conflict with another optical signal block NO process may include determining whether the wavelength is tunable and routable at either end block . For example network management device may determine whether the selected wavelength is both tunable and routable at both ends. An end may refer to a PIC associated with a first ROADM that transmits the optical signal and another PIC associated with a second ROADM that receives the optical signal. In some implementations an end may be a PIC that transmits to another PIC e.g. another PIC of the same ROADM another PIC of a different ROADM or the like .

A selected wavelength may be tunable if a PIC associated with transmitting receiving the optical signal assigned to the selected wavelength is configurable to tune to the selected wavelength. For example a first PIC e.g. a Tx PIC may be tunable to a first set of wavelengths and a second PIC e.g. an Rx PIC may be tunable to a second set of wavelengths and network management device may determine whether the selected wavelength is included in both the first set of wavelengths and the second set of wavelengths.

Routability of a selected wavelength may refer to a set of constraints limiting a quantity of directions in which optical signals associated with a particular PIC can be routed. For example a first PIC may connect to a particular set of outputs associated with routing optical signals to a particular set of ROADMs and a second PIC may connect to another set of outputs associated with routing optical signals to another set of ROADMs . A constraint may be referred to as a limited degree of routability. In some implementations network management device may utilize stored information regarding the set of PICs to determine whether the selected wavelength associated with the optical signal and the assigned ends e.g. a Tx PIC associated with a first ROADM and an Rx PIC associated with a second ROADM is routable.

As further shown in if the selected wavelength identifier conflicts with another optical signal block YES and or if the selected wavelength is not tunable and routable at either end block NO process may include determining whether a wavelength limit is reached block . For example network management device may determine whether the wavelength limit is reached. The wavelength limit may refer to a quantity of wavelengths w that may be considered for assignment to the optical signal. For example network management device may determine whether there are no remaining wavelengths of the set of wavelengths which have been selected for assignment to the optical signal.

As further shown in if the wavelength limit is not reached block NO process may include returning to block . For example network management device may select another wavelength identifier of the set of wavelength identifiers to assign to the optical signal. In some implementations network management device may select the other wavelength identifier based on a saturation degree a degree of the vertex a quantity of unassigned neighbors or the like.

As further shown in if the wavelength limit is reached block YES process may include moving the optical signal to another PIC block . For example network management device may move the optical signal to another PIC associated with a particular ROADM . In some implementations network management device may select another PIC of a set of other PICs associated with the particular ROADM based on a quantity of optical signals being transmitted by the other PIC a quantity of wavelengths assigned to optical signals being transmitted by the other PIC or the like. In some implementations network management device may move the optical signal to another transmitting PIC associated with the same or a different ROADM another receiving PIC associated with the same or a different ROADM or the like. Additionally or alternatively network management device may move the optical signal to another transmitting PIC associated with a first ROADM and to another receiving PIC associated with a second ROADM . In some implementations network management device may iteratively move the optical signal to one or more other PICs until network management device is able to determine a wavelength identifier that does not conflict with another optical signal and is able to determine that the selected wavelength is tunable and routable at either end.

As further shown in process may include updating the wavelength identifier graph based on moving the optical signal to the other PIC block and returning to block . For example network management device may update the wavelength identifier graph based on moving the optical signal to the other PIC. In some implementations network management device may alter a set of edges and a set of vertices when updating the wavelength identifier graph. For example network management device may remove a vertex associated with the optical signal and may remove edges associated with the vertex. In some implementations network management device may remove one or more other edges of the wavelength identifier graph and or add one or more other edges to the wavelength identifier graph. In some implementations network management device may activate another PIC when moving the optical signal to the other PIC. For example when network management device is unsuccessful with wavelength assignment for all active PICs of ROADM network management device may activate another PIC of ROADM for the optical signal.

In some implementations network management device may generate another wavelength identifier graph. For example network management device may determine another logical topology for the optical signals based on moving the optical signal to the other PIC and may generate another wavelength identifier graph based on the other logical topology for the optical signals. In some implementations network management device may generate another wavelength identifier graph for the other PIC. For example network management device may generate another wavelength identifier graph associated with the other PIC to perform wavelength assignment for the other PIC based on moving the optical signal to the other PIC. In some implementations network management device may select another optical signal of the set of optical signals for wavelength assignment.

As further shown in if the selected wavelength is tunable and routable at either end block YES process may include assigning the wavelength identifier to the optical signal block . For example network management device may assign the wavelength corresponding to the wavelength identifier to the optical signal. In some implementations network management device may instruct ROADM to transmit and or receive the optical signal at the wavelength corresponding to the wavelength identifier. For example network management device may cause a laser associated with a particular PIC of ROADM to be tuned to the wavelength that corresponds to the wavelength identifier when transmitting receiving the optical signal. Additionally or alternatively network management device may wait until wavelength assignment is complete before causing the laser associated with the particular PIC of ROADM to be tuned to the wavelength.

As further shown in process may include determining whether there are any optical signals without an assigned wavelength identifier block . For example network management device may determine whether another optical signal of the set of optical signals lacks an assigned wavelength identifier corresponding to a wavelength.

As further shown in if there is another optical signal without an assigned wavelength identifier block YES process may include returning to block . For example network management device may select the other optical signal for wavelength assignment as discussed herein with regard to block . In some implementations network management device may select the other optical signal from a set of other optical signals that have not been assigned a wavelength identifier corresponding to a wavelength based on a criteria such as a saturation degree a degree of a vertex associated with the other optical signal a quantity of unassigned neighbors or the like.

As further shown in if there are not any optical signals without an assigned wavelength identifier block NO process may include determining wavelength assignment is complete block . For example network management device may determine that wavelength assignment is complete and may notify a set of ROADMs associated with transmitting routing receiving the set of optical signals that the set of optical signals may be transmitted routed received using the set of assigned wavelengths. In some implementations network management device may monitor optical network to determine whether wavelength assignment should be performed again based on an alteration to optical network . For example network management device may receive information from network devices of optical network indicating the alteration to optical network such as an optical signal being added an optical signal being dropped a quantity of network traffic being altered or the like. In this case network management device may determine whether a topology e.g. a logical topology a fiber topology or the like has changed and may perform wavelength assignment again based on determining that the topology has changed.
