title: Microporous polyolefin-based aerogels
abstract: Microporous polyolefin and microporous polydicyclopentadiene (polyDCPD) based aerogels and methods for preparing and using the same are provided. The aerogels are produced by forming a polymer gel structure within a solvent from a olefin or dicyclopentadiene monomer via Ring Opening Metathesis Polymerization (ROMP) reactions, followed by supercritical drying to remove the solvent from the aerogel. Other aerogels are prepared by sequentially (1) mixing at least one dicyclopentadiene monomer, at least one solvent at least one catalyst and at least one inorganic and/or organic reinforcing material, (2) gelling the mixture, (3) aging, and (4) supercritical drying. Aerogels provided herein are inexpensive to prepare, possess desirable thermal, mechanical, acoustic, chemical, and physical properties and are hydrophobic. The aerogels provided herein are suitable for use in various applications, including but not limited to thermal and acoustic insulation, radiation shielding, and vibrational damping applications.

This invention relates to polyolefin aerogels polyolefin microporous materials methods of making same and articles composed of said aerogels or microporous materials. More particularly the invention provides microporous polydicyclopentadiene materials prepared by ring opening metathesis polymerization polymerization and drying methods of making same and articles composed of the polydicyclopentadiene materials.

Aerogels invented in 1931 by Kistler Kistler S. S. Coherent Expanded Aerogels and Jellies Nature 127 741 1931 and Coherent Expanded Aerogels J. Physical Chem. 36 52 1932 are formed from a gel by replacing the liquid phase with air. The first aerogels produced by Kistler had silicon dioxide silica as the solid phase of the gel structure. Silica gels can be formed via polymerization of silicic acid Si OH . Aerogels prepared from sol gel processing with silica oxides have been quite interesting due to their extremely low density high surface area and attractive optical dielectric thermal and acoustic properties. These excellent properties explain why aerogels have been considered for use in many important applications such as thermal insulations. More detailed description can be found in the following references LeMay et al. Low Density Microcellular Materials MRS Bulletin December 1990 p. 19 44 and D. Schaefer Structure of mesoporous aerogels MRS Bulletin April 1994 p. 49 53.

The ambient pressure drying process is called the xerogel process and results organic and inorganic based wet gel with many physical properties which differ from aerogels. For example U.S. Pat. No. 5 478 867 disclosed a microporous isocyanate based xerogel composition and method of its preparation using a vacuum oven. However this ambient pressure drying process generally shows more shrinkage and damage due to surface tension forces during drying. Moreover the drying time for xerogels is relatively very long.

The primary approach to making aerogels is to dry the gel matrix in a supercritical fluid medium. Kistler used a supercritical alcohol process to dry the gel matrix. Such processes though successful are energy intensive due to higher critical points of alcohols. Another method is to use supercritical carbon dioxide which has a relatively lower critical point. During supercritical drying the temperature and the pressure are increased beyond the critical point where the phase boundary between the liquid and vapor phase disappears. Once the critical point is passed there is no distinction between the liquid and vapor phase and the solvent can be removed without introducing a liquid vapor interface capillary pressure or any associated mass transfer limitations. Liquid COis generally used as the supercritical extraction fluid because the process can be performed near ambient temperature. A good description of supercritical drying technology may be found in a recent process patent U.S. Pat. No. 6 670 402 which discloses a rapid aerogel production process utilizing a unique supercritical fluid pressure modulation technique. An example of supercritical drying of organic aerogel can also be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5 962 539 which discloses a process and equipment for drying a polymeric aerogel in the presence of a supercritical fluid.

Although silica aerogels demonstrate many unusual and useful properties they are inherently fragile brittle and hydrophilic. There have been several attempts at overcoming weakness and brittleness issues in silica aerogels. Development of the flexible fiber reinforced silica aerogel composite blanket is one of the promising approaches. For example U.S. Pat. No. 6 068 882 discloses forming aerogels interstitially within a fiber matrix. However for certain applications requiring durability under dynamic use conditions such as in spacesuits the silica aerogel blankets still exhibit durability problems related to dust generation and thermal performance degradation due to the fragile nature of the aerogel. Organically treated silica aerogels demonstrate much improved impact and flexural strength. More details on such hybrid silica aerogels obtained by co polymerization with an organic compound can be found in the following references Leventis et al Nanoengineering Strong Silica Aerogels Nano Letters 2 957 2002 and Zhang et al Isocyanate cross linked silica structurally strong aerogels Polymer Preprint 44 35 2003 . However these materials are still very brittle i.e. not less fragile and generate dust. More flexible aerogels than silica aerogels have been reported and are referred to as organically modified silica aerogel or Ormosil by Schmidt H. New type of non crystalline solids between inorganic and organic materials J Non Cryst. Solids 73 681 1985 or as Aeromosil by Kramer et al. Organically Modified Silicate Aerogel Aeromosil Mat. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. 435 295 1996 . However these are still weak generate dust when handled and are not durable due to the inherently fragile nature of the predominant silica aerogel matrix.

The unique porous nanostructure was also reported in organic and carbon based aerogels. A good description for organic aerogels can be found in Pekala and Schaefer Structure of organic aerogels. 1. Morphology and Scaling Macromolecules 26 5487 1993 . Kistler first prepared organic aerogels based on natural products and their derivatives. Pekala and co workers developed several organic aerogels. More details can be found in the following references Polym. Preprints 29 204 1988 Polym. Preprints 30 221 1989 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 873 218 4 997 804 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 081 163 5 086 085 U.S. Pat. No. 5 476 878. Biesmans et al. describes polyurethane aerogels and or their pyrolyzed carbon aerogel counterparts. Details on this can be obtained from the following references Biesmans et al. Polyurethane based organic aerogels thermal performance J Non Cryst. Solids 225 36 1998 Biesmans et al. Polyurethane based organic aerogels and their transformation into carbon aerogels J Non Cryst. Solids 225 64 1998 and Rigacci A. et al. Preparation of polyurethane based aerogels and xerogels for thermal superinsulation J Non Cryst. Solids 350 372 2004 . U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 478 867 5 484 818 5 942 553 5 869 545 and 5 990 184 describe polyisocyanurate based organic xerogels and aerogels and their preparation methods. However since these polyisocyanurate or polyurethane based materials were mostly tailored for xerogels or highly crosslinkable systems and constituent components suitable for carbon aerogel and vacuum panel applications they are very brittle and stiff. Also such polyisocyanurate or polyurethane based aerogel system is slowly gelled at ambient conditions which is a major economic disadvantage in production. In addition polyurethane based aerogels previously described show high thermal conductivity values. Recently a very strong and less fragile organic aerogel was introduced and more details can be obtained from following references Tan et al Organic Aerogels with Very High Impact Strength Advanced. Materials 13 644 2001 and Zhang G. et al. Isocyanate crosslinked silica aerogel monoliths preparation and characterization J Non Cryst. Solids 350 152 2004 . Although they significantly improved mechanical properties and obtained less fragile aerogels they were still very rigid and brittle when compared with the materials of the present inventions. These materials would not be suitable for certain applications requiring exceptional flexibility and durability such as spacesuit military and civilian apparels tents shoes and gloves.

Dicyclopentadiene DCPD produced by heating crude oil products results from a facile Diels Alder dimerization of cyclopentadiene CP monomer . The main interest in the DCPD monomer is that it can be used to produce a range of different macromolecular architectures from purely linear to highly cross linked polymers. DCPD is also an economically interesting monomer since it is a byproduct in the petrochemical industry such as ethylene manufacture and thus is cheap and readily available. Poly DCPD has been used to produce many products ranging from high quality optical lenses to flame retardants for plastics hot melt adhesives and other injection molding products. Other applications include uses as a chemical intermediate in the manufacture of insecticides a hardener and dryer in linseed and soybean oil and in the production of several polymeric systems such as ethylene propylene diene monomer EPDM and elastomers as a co monomer metallocenes varnishes and paints. DCPD resins have been formulated to make tough thermoset materials via Ring Opening Metathesis Polymerization ROMP reactions examples of which can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 4 400 340 U.S. Pat. No. 4 469 809 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 020 443. PolyDCPD produced via the ROMP reaction may be post cured to increase the degree of the cross linking of the polyDCPD material. PolyDCPD is a tough rigid and low cost thermoset polymer with excellent mechanical chemical and physical properties such as high modulus low viscosities extraordinary tensile and impact strength good physical and mechanical durability at lower temperatures excellent chemical resistance and excellent hydrophobicity. In addition the polymer surface and network can be easily chemically modified via reaction with the many pendant unsaturated double bonds resulting from the ROMP reaction.

Dicyclopentadiene monomers e.g. DCPD monomers which are suitable for use in the methods of the invention and in the preparation of the microporous articles of the invention include dicyclopentadiene substituted dicyclopentadiene and partially polymerized dicyclopentadiene resins. In certain applications dicyclopentadiene dicyclopentadiene substituted with 1 2 3 or 4 methyl groups or ROMP polymerized dicyclopentadiene having a molecular weight of less than about 10 000 are preferred DCPD monomers. In certain other applications dicyclopentadiene is a preferred DCPD monomer.

Both the endo and exo isomers and mixtures thereof of DCPD monomers are suitable for use in the present invention. The preferred DCPD monomers may be endo isomers. The DCPD monomers for use in the present invention include dicyclopentadiene CH Diels Alder heterodimers of cyclopentadiene and an alkylated cyclopentadiene e.g. a cyclopentadiene having one two or three alkyl substituents such as methylcyclopentadiene ethylcyclopentadiene dimethylcyclopentadienes and the like and Diels Alder homodimers of alkylated cyclopentadienes such as di methylcyclopentadiene CH and mixtures thereof.

In certain aspects the microporous polyDCPD or polyDCPD aerogel is prepared by ROMP polymerization of one or more functionalized DCPD monomers. For example the functionalized DCPD monomers may include one or more functional groups such as hydroxyl thiol ketone aldehyde ester ether amine amide nitro acid carboxylic acid disulfide carbonate carboalkoxy acid isocyanate carbodiimide carboalkoxy and halogen.

The purity of the DCPD monomer is not critical to the practicing the invention. Ring opening metathesis polymerization of high and low purity dicyclopentadiene monomers have been reported previously. For example low purity dicyclopentadiene polymerization with ruthenium carbenes is reported in U.S. Pat. No. 6 020 443. Although not wishing to be bound by theory the instant invention provides aerogel or microporous products which are generated by polymerizing a precursor monomer at a concentration corresponding to a target theoretical density. Olefin monomers such as DCPD monomers of various purities can be used in the methods of the invention by controlling the final concentration of the olefin or DCPD monomer in the polymerization reaction mixture. Although lower purity olefin precursors may be used in the methods of the invention higher purity DCPD resins are generally preferred.

In certain aspects preferred DCPD monomers for use in the present invention contain at least about 70 DCPD monomer by weight more preferably greater than 80 . For example these high purity DCPD resins are commercially available under the trademark by UPR grade containing DCPD monomer about 84 from Chevron Phillips Chemical Com. under the trademark by Polyester grade containing DCPD monomer about 84 from Texmark Inc. under the trademark by Petroplast 94 containing DCPD monomer about 94 from Shell Chemicals Ltd. under the trademark by Ultrene 97 containing DCPD monomer about 97 purity from Cymetech LLC and Ultrene 99 containing DCPD monomer about 99 purity from Cymetech LLC . Mixtures of these DCPD resins can be used.

The DCPD monomers for use in the present invention is used in amounts ranging from about 0.1 to about 60 by weight of the polymerization reaction mixture e.g. the admixture of DCPD monomer solvent catalyst and any optional additives or reinforcement material . In certain aspects the DCPD monomer is from about 0.5 to about 55 by weight of the polymerization reaction mixture or from about 1 to about 50 by weight of the polymerization reaction mixture depending on the desired final properties of the product microporous material or aerogel.

The DCPD monomers may optionally be refluxed filtered and degassed before the catalyst is added although none of these procedures is necessary to practice the invention. In certain aspects it is preferable to avoid cracking the DCPD monomer into constituent cyclopentadiene fragments. For applications where it would be desirable to reflux distill or otherwise heat the DCPD monomer to a temperature at which a retro Diels Alder occurs it is preferable to maintain the DCPD monomer at a temperature conducive to dimerization of cyclopentadiene prior to addition of the metathesis catalyst.

In certain aspects the present invention relates to a porous polyDCPD based material including a polyDCPD based aerogel material produced by the methods discussed above.

The polyDCPD polymer can also comprise substituted equivalents of the polyDCPD monomeric units of Formula I or Formula II.

The amount of catalyst for the present invention is preferably used in the ratio between the catalyst and the total solid weight including DCPD monomer and organic and inorganic additives incorporated. The preferred ratio between the catalyst and the total solid weight is about 1 100 1 wt and 1 20000 0.005 wt . If the ratio between the catalyst and the total solid weight of less than 1 20000 is used the polyDCPD wet gels are very weak and cannot withstand deformation during supercritical drying. The invention may be practiced with the ratios between the catalyst and the total solid outside of the above range depending on the temperature time period during gelation and aging rate of drying and incorporation of reinforcement materials into the sol prior to gelation.

The amount of solvent for use in the present invention depends on the desired density and additives used such as opacifiers and reinforcement material . The nature and amount of solvent that can be used may be based on the theoretical or target density considering that the final density is generally higher than the theoretical density because of shrinkage realized during the aging and supercritical drying steps.

In order to further improve the polymerization reaction thermal and mechanical properties the structural integrity and the handling of the aerogel monoliths or aerogel composites various additives can be incorporated into the sol gel process. For example various organic or inorganic additives or reinforcement materials can be incorporated in the sol gel process. Typical concentrations of the additives is between about 0.1 and about 50 by weight based on the weight of DCPD monomer or polyolefin monomer. In certain aspects the additives incorporated into the sol gel process do not interfere with the polymerization of the DCPD monomer or olefin monomer. That is preferred additives do not interfere with the metathesis polymerization e.g. ROMP of the DCPD monomer or polyolefin monomer. Thus the organic and inorganic IR opacifiers other additives and or reinforcement materials incorporated in the sol gel process do not interfere with the ROMP reaction and are capable of being dispersed in polyDCPD based aerogels. In certain aspects the organic and inorganic IR opacifiers other additives and or reinforcement materials incorporated in the sol gel process do not interfere with the ROMP reaction and are capable of being uniformly or homogeneously dispersed in polyDCPD based aerogels.

In certain applications where the microporous materials or aerogels including the polyDCPD aerogels are exposed to oxygen and high temperature it is desirable to incorporate one or more antioxidant into the microporous material or aerogel. Antioxidants can be incorporated in the sol gel process preferably in an amount of between 0.1 and 20 by weight based on the weight of polyDCPD resin. Examples of suitable antioxidant materials include phenol based compounds or phosphorus based compounds. The commonly known general purpose phenol based compound antioxidants especially commercially available material such as Irganox 259 Irganox 1010 or Irganox 1076 manufactured by Ciba Specialty Chemicals Inc can be used herein. The phosphorus based compounds are exemplified by the material commercially available under the trademark by Ultranox 626 Ultranox 641 or Ultranox 668 manufactured by GE Specialty Chemicals . They may be used alone or in combinations of two or more.

In certain aspects addition of one or more cross linking agents to the reaction mixture or before gelation may be desirable to initiate additional post curing reaction of the polyDCPD based aerogel products. Some commonly known peroxide crosslinking agents disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 728 785 may be used for the present invention. Examples of the preferred peroxides cross linking agents include alkyl peroxides particularly tert butyl peroxide or di t butyl peroxide 2 5 dimethyl 2 5 di tert butylperoxy hexyne 3 2 5 dimethyl 2 5 di tert butylperoxy hexane dicumyl peroxide 2 5 dimethyl 2 5 di t butylperoxy hexane methyl ethyl ketone peroxide or any mixtures thereof.

The red phosphorus and brominated aromatic compounds are solids that contribute flame retardancy to the polyDCPD based aerogel products.

The addition of an elastomer increases the impact strength of polyDCPD based aerogel without extremely decreasing the flexural modulus and excessively increasing the solution viscosity. Suitable elastomers for use in the present invention include natural rubber butyl rubber polyisoprene polybutadiene polyisobutylene ethylenepropylene copolymer styrene butadiene styrene triblock rubber styrene isoprene styrene triblock rubber and ethylenepropylene diene terpolymers. The elastomers should be dissolved in DCPD monomer mixture solution to form a homogeneous solution.

Other additives such as binders plasticizers pigments and dyes etc as are known in the art may optionally be included in DCPD monomer mixture solution.

A total solid content of the reaction mixture is preferably between 0.1 and 60 by weight more preferably between 1 and 50 by weight.

A solution is made of the DCPD monomers and solvents and or organic and inorganic additives incorporated. Subsequently the catalyst is introduced into the solvent DCPD monomer mixture. Alternatively in order to improve mixing efficiency a solution of the catalyst in the solvent s can be added to the solvent DCPD monomer mixture. Mixing can be preferably done at a temperature between the melting and boiling point of the solvent. In certain methods a temperature between about 10 C. to about 150 C. or between about 10 C. and about 100 C. is suitable for mixing the solvent monomer catalyst and optional additives. In certain other methods a mixing temperature of about 15 C. about 20 C. about 30 C. about 40 C. about 50 C. about 60 C. about 70 C. about 80 C. about 90 C. or at a temperature range bounded by any two of the preceding temperatures is suitable for mixing the solvent monomer catalyst and optional additives.

After combination of the solvent monomer catalyst and optional additives the mixture is left standing for a certain period of time to form a polymeric gel. This time period varies from 30 seconds to several days even weeks and months depending on the DCPD monomer content catalyst type and loading e.g. the relative concentration of catalyst to monomer the target density and or organic and inorganic additives incorporated. The preferred gelation temperature for the present invention ranges from about 10 C. to about 200 C. more preferably from 20 C. to 150 C. and is preferably lower than the boiling point of the solvent and monomers. Although not wishing to be bound by theory selecting a gelation temperature less than the boiling point of the solvent and monomers is believed to preserve the pore structure of the wet gel formed via the polymerization reaction. The gelation time for the present invention is preferably between 30 seconds and 24 hours more preferably from 2 minute to 12 hours in the temperature range from 20 C. to 150 C.

In certain aspects formation of a more uniform wet gel provides microporous materials and aerogels with superior physical properties. In one aspect a more uniform wet gel is obtained by thermally stabilizing the wet gel after gelation at a temperature above or below room temperature. Allowing the wet get to thermally stabilize at room temperature prevents additional thermal stress on the gel during subsequent processing steps. The resting period although not required for any of the methods recited herein facilitates the processing of lower density gels which often possess less structural strength. In certain aspects the resting period for thermal stabilization lasts for 2 minutes to 1 day for 5 minutes to 12 hours or from 10 minutes to 2 hours. The appropriate time period for thermal stabilization is dependent upon the three dimensional morphology of the gel and the thermal conductivity of the gelation vessel.

Although the DCPD monomer mixture gels within a few seconds a few minutes or a few hours it has been found advantageous to age post cure the wet gels at elevated temperatures for an additional period of time. Although not wishing to be bound by theory post curing of the wet gel is believed to increase the extent of polymerization and the number density of inter strand cross links which provides a stronger gel for easier handling and less breaking in subsequent processing steps. Aging at higher temperatures reduces the period of time required to obtain a stronger gel. This aging process is more beneficial for weaker gels prepared with lower target density. The preferable aging time period for use in the present invention varies from 1 hour to several days more typically ranges from 2 hours to 100 hrs. Aging temperatures ranges from 10 C. to 200 C. preferably from 20 C. to 150 C. It is also important that aging temperatures should be lower than the boiling points of solvents to preserve the pore structure of the wet gel including nanopores and micropores . Preferred aging solvents for use in the present invention are hexane toluene methyl ethyl ketone methyl isobutyl ketone acetone tetrahydrofuran dichloromethane 3 methyl 2 butanone 2 propanol 1 butanol ethanol methanol water or mixtures thereof. Optionally additional catalysts including additional metathesis catalysts can be added in the aging solvents for further reaction. The aging solvents recommended to be added in enough volume to form a solvent layer over wet gel surface.

Thereafter the polyDCPD based aerogels can be obtained from their wet gels after drying. The preferable drying for the present invention is under supercritical conditions which involves placing the solvent filled gel in a temperature controlled pressure vessel and bringing the vessel to a pressure above the critical pressure of CO2 by filling with CO2 gas or liquid CO2. In another embodiment before the drying step the solvent in the wet gel can be exchanged with liquid carbon dioxide. Modifiers for example surfactants to reduce the interfacial energy can be added to the carbon dioxide to make the gels more suitable for supercritical drying. At that point the vessel is then heated above the critical temperature of the CO2. After a few hours the pressure is slowly released from the vessel while keeping a constant temperature. After the vessel cools down and is at atmospheric pressure the dried polyDCPD based aerogels are removed from the vessel.

After supercritical drying is complete the dried polyDCPD based aerogels may be post cured to further increase cross linking reaction. The post curing the dried polyDCPD aerogels at an elevated temperature in the presence of a peroxide cross linking agent may result in better mechanical and chemical properties due to increased cross linking density. Alternatively the post curing methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 728 785 may be used for the present invention. The preferred post curing temperature ranges from 30 C. to 200 C. more preferably from 50 C. to 180 C. The post curing may be conducted under air or inert gas depending on incorporating antioxidant.

The target density which is also referred to herein as the theoretical density of the microporous material and or aerogel refers to the density calculated based on the concentration of the monomer is the reaction solvent without any shrinkage due to processing or drying of the gel. Target densities for polyDCPD based aerogels provided herein are typically in a range from about 0.01 g cmto about 0.6 g cm or in a range of from about 0.02 g cmto about 0.5 g cm. Densities of final aerogels are higher than their theoretical values because some shrinkage occurs during post gelation processing e.g. some shrinkage occurs during the aging of the gel or during supercritical drying of the gel.

The polyDCPD based aerogels prepared according to the process of the present invention generally have small pore sizes in the range 1 to 100 nm determined by Brunauer Emmet Teller BET nitrogen adsorption method The average pore diameter is calculated as 4V A with V cumulative pore volume per gram of material and A specific surface area . BET surface areas of the aerogels prepared according to the process of the present invention are generally in the range 1 to 500 m g.

The thermal conductivity coefficients of the polyDCPD based aerogels monoliths and composites depend on the final aerogel densities. At room temperature and atmospheric pressure the polyDCPD based aerogel monoliths and aerogel composites prepared according to the process of the present invention generally have thermal conductivity coefficients between 5 and 50 mW m K more generally between 10 to 40 mW m K. The thermal conductivity coefficients of polyDCPD based aerogel monoliths and composites at a high vacuum pressure below 0.001 torr or mm Hg are generally lower than 10 mW m K.

The potential applications for the present polyDCPD based aerogels include but not to limited to uses for thermal and acoustic insulation radiation shielding and vibrational damping materials in aerospace military and commercial applications. For example space suit gloves footwear and helmets catalyst support selectively permeable membrane sensor packing material aircraft cryogenic tanks liquefied gas transport systems for warming storing and or transporting food and medicine sleeping bags and pads military and recreational cloth and tents etc. The present polyDCPD based aerogels can be also used or re used as impact modifiers and or filler materials for conventional plastics. In one embodiment porous materials of the present invention are incorporated into a vacuum sealed envelope package or container for use as insulation materials.

In order to better explain the present invention the following examples are provided. These examples are intended to illustrate the present invention and the present invention is not limited thereto.

Prometa C0716 ruthenium catalyst package available from Cymetech containing ruthenium catalyst of about 5 as an active component.

First Ultrene 99 3.44 g high purity DCPD is weighed into a polypropylene container with a screw cap. Subsequently toluene 96.45 g is added and the mixture is stirred until a homogeneous solution results. Next Prometa C0716 ruthenium catalyst 0.07 g is added to the homogeneous solution. After stirring for one minute to evenly disperse the catalyst through the mixture the reaction mixture is allowed to stand and the time until gelation occurs is recorded. A portion of the sol is transferred into a plastic container containing quartz fiber batting to form a composite sample. The remaining portion in the original polypropylene container is used to form a monolith sample. The monolith and composite samples are gelled by sealing the respective containers to prevent evaporation and the containers are maintained in a quiescent condition to form a polymeric gel. After waiting an additional 30 minutes to ensure the uniform gelation of the mixture acetone is added to each container in an amount sufficient to cover the gel surface. In this way collapse of the pore structure due to evaporation of solvent out of the gel is minimized. The wet gels are aged for 20 hrs in an oven preset at 50 C.

Once the aging process is complete the samples are cooled to room temperature and the wet gels are loaded into a pressure vessel having a volume of 60 L. After closure of the vessel liquid COat about 10 C. is introduced into the vessel through a valve near the top of the vessel at a rate sufficient to generate about 1500 psig after 10 minutes. The acetone is exchanged with liquid carbon dioxide and the mixture COand acetone is withdrawn through a pressure relief system that maintains the pressure inside the vessel at 1500 psig. The COand acetone mixture is decompressed and reheated in separators where gaseous COand acetone are withdrawn COis recycled through a standard liquefaction and pumping process. When little acetone remains in the pressure vessel the temperature in the pressure vessel is increased to 50 C. for 50 minutes until a supercritical condition of the COis reached. After supercritically drying the sample for 1 hr the pressure is slowly released from the vessel for a period of 90 min or until atmospheric conditions are reached. The dried aerogel is removed from the vessel.
