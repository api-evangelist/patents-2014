title: Systems and methods for metadata-driven command processor and structured program transfer protocol
abstract: Systems and methods for facilitating on-demand delivery and processing of program(s) and program-compatible application(s) on a plurality of different machines. In an embodiment, a metadata-driven command processor on a machine sends a request for a booting program and application to an agent. In response to the request, the agent invokes a resource to generate a booting program dataset that defines the booting program and an application dataset that defines the application, generates a response dataset comprising two or more nested datasets, wherein the two or more nested datasets comprise at least the booting program dataset and the application dataset, and sends the response dataset to the metadata-driven command processor. The metadata-driven command processor copies the booting program dataset and the application dataset into a process dataset comprising two or more nested datasets, and processes the first process dataset to execute the booting program and application on the machine.

The invention is generally directed to the on demand delivery and processing of codeless programs and program compatible applications on any machine.

Conventionally in order to execute an application on a machine it must be specifically designed and implemented for that particular machine. For example different versions of a software application must be created to work on both the Microsoft Windows operating system and Mac OS . Virtual machines have mitigated this issue to an extent. Specifically a virtual machine is a software simulation of an abstract or real machine that is generally different from the machine on which it is being executed. A virtual machine allows a software application designed for the virtual machine to be run on each machine on which the virtual machine is installed and executed regardless of the machine s particular architecture. However currently there is no way to allow programs and applications to be transferred on demand from machine to machine while preserving their processing or execution states across those different machines. In addition there is currently no way to execute a program and application on any machine e.g. from an appliance controller e.g. home thermostat to a mobile device e.g. smart phone . For instance conventional home thermostats cannot act as a virtual machine running a Windows application.

Accordingly systems and methods are disclosed for on demand transfer and delivery and processing of programs and program compatible applications on any machine and across different machines.

In an embodiment a method for facilitating on demand delivery and processing of one or more programs and program compatible applications is disclosed. The method comprises using at least one hardware processor by a first metadata driven command processor on a first machine sending a first request for a booting program and application to an agent wherein the first request comprises an identification of a resource in response to the first request by the agent invoking the identified resource to generate a booting program dataset that defines the booting program and an application dataset that defines the application generating a first response dataset wherein the first response dataset comprises two or more nested datasets wherein the two or more nested datasets comprise at least the booting program dataset and the application dataset and sending the first response dataset to the first metdata driven command processor and by the first metadata driven command processor copying the booting program dataset and the application dataset into a first process dataset comprising two or more nested datasets and processing the first process dataset to execute the booting program and the application on the first machine.

In an additional embodiment a system for facilitating on demand delivery and processing of one or more programs and program compatible applications is disclosed. The system comprises a first machine comprising at least one hardware processor and a first metadata driven command processor and an agent wherein the first metadata driven command processor sends a first request for a booting program and application to the agent wherein the first request comprises an identification of a resource wherein in response to the first request the agent invokes the identified resource to generate a booting program dataset that defines the booting program and an application dataset that defines the application generates a first response dataset wherein the first response dataset comprises two or more nested datasets wherein the two or more nested datasets comprise at least the booting program dataset and the application dataset and sends the first response dataset to the first metdata driven command processor and wherein the first metadata driven command processor copies the booting program dataset and the application dataset into a first process dataset comprising two or more nested datasets and processes the first process dataset to execute the booting program and the application on the first machine.

In an additional embodiment a non transitory computer readable medium is disclosed. The medium has stored thereon a first metadata driven command processor comprising a first set of instructions and an agent comprising a second set of instructions wherein the first metadata driven command processor sends a first request for a booting program and application to the agent wherein the first request comprises an identification of a resource wherein in response to the first request the agent invokes the identified resource to generate a booting program dataset that defines the booting program and an application dataset that defines the application generates a first response dataset wherein the first response dataset comprises two or more nested datasets wherein the two or more nested datasets comprise at least the booting program dataset and the application dataset and sends the first response dataset to the first metdata driven command processor and wherein the first metadata driven command processor copies the booting program dataset and the application dataset into a first process dataset comprising two or more nested datasets and processes the first process dataset to execute the booting program and the application on the first machine.

 Booting The process of loading and executing bootstrap software by a computer during the start up process. Booting is a chain of events that start with execution of hardware based procedures that may then hand off to firmware and software which is loaded into memory. Booting often involves processes such as performing self tests and loading configuration settings Basic Input Output System BIOS resident monitors a hypervisor an operating system and or utility software.

 Event An action that is initiated outside the scope of a command processor and that is handled by the command processor. Typical sources of events include users e.g. via keystroke s i.e. pressing one or more keys on a keyboard and software or hardware devices e.g. a timer . A computer program that changes its behavior in response to events is said to be event driven often with the goal of being interactive.

 Instruction Set A collection of computer instructions including native data types instructions registers addressing modes memory architecture interrupt and exception handling and external Input Output I O . Instructions are in the form of a programming language i.e. source code or machine language i.e. machine code that is compatible with a machine resource. Source code is written using some human readable computer language usually as text. The source code of a program is specially designed to facilitate the work of computer programmers who specify the actions to be performed by a computer primarily by writing source code. The source code is automatically translated at some point to machine code that the computer can directly read and execute.

The disclosed metadata driven command processor and structured program transfer protocol facilitate on demand delivery and processing of codeless programs and program compatible applications on virtually any machine from an appliance controller e.g. home thermostat to a smart device e.g. smart phone . The disclosed embodiments also facilitate the transfer and delivery of programs and applications on one machine e.g. tablet PC to another machine e.g. in vehicle navigation system via a communications interface while maintaining the process state of the programs and or applications. The request delivery and transfer of program and application metadata between machines are facilitated by a novel structured program transfer protocol for communications. The applications can be as simple as an on off switch or as complex as client server business solutions e.g. enterprise resource planning ERP customer relationship management CRM etc. .

For example the disclosed metadata driven command processor and structured program transfer protocol can facilitate codeless rapid development and on demand delivery of database applications on end user devices such as smart phones tablets PCs and in vehicle navigation systems. The database application may be a spreadsheet web site client server business solution etc. From the database application s metadata the metadata driven command processor can dynamically generate statements in various scripting languages e.g. HTML SQL XML PCL executed on the end user device EUD or on a remote resource e.g. web service to render a user interface retrieve and manipulate database content and invoke EUD specific functionality e.g. print documents capture signatures scan barcodes read credit cards etc. .

The metadata driven command processor may have functionality and purpose similar to that of MS DOS whereas the programs may have functionality and purpose similar to Microsoft Windows and the applications may have functionality and purpose similar to Windows based applications. However the disclosed systems and methods are metadata driven to provide nearly universal applicability across all machines. The instruction set within the metadata driven command processor is minimal and can be embedded within a machine s operating system chipset or other machine component. Alternatively or additionally the instruction set can be embedded within a container software application e.g. web browser that is installed on the machines.

A structured program transfer protocol is also disclosed. The structured program transfer protocol is a type of communication protocol that defines the dataset schema for sending a type of request SPTPRequest and receiving programs applications data and execution state collectively as a type of response SPTPResponse from one machine to another.

Agent may launch metadata driven command processor on machine passing it a booting SPTPRequest that specifies the source of the booting program and application to be processed. Metadata driven command processor may send a SPTPRequest to agent and receive a SPTPResponse from that agent.

The SPTPRequest may identify the resource needed to execute the SPTPRequest. If the resource identified in the SPTPRequest is on a remote machine e.g. machine then the SPTPRequest also identifies the agent e.g. agent on the remote machine that can communicate with the resource e.g. resource on the remote machine. In this case agent forwards the SPTPRequest e.g. SPTPRequest to the remote agent e.g. agent .

If the SPTPRequest specifies a request to send a booting program and application then agent or the identified remote agent e.g. agent invokes the identified resource or remote resource e.g. resource to generate the booting Program and Application datasets. The invoking agent generates a SPTPResponse that includes a structured version of the booting Program and Application datasets e.g. Program dataset and Application dataset . If the SPTPResponse is generated by a remote agent e.g. agent then the remote agent returns the SPTPResponse e.g. SPTPResponse to agent . Agent returns the SPTPResponse to metadata driven command processor for processing. Metadata driven command processor copies the contents of the Program and Application datasets included in the SPTPResponse to Program dataset and Application dataset nested in Process dataset and continues processing.

If the SPTPRequest specifies a request to send an additional program compatible application then agent or the identified remote agent e.g. agent invokes the identified resource or remote resource e.g. 180 to generate the additional program compatible application datasets. The invoking agent generates a SPTPResponse that includes a structured version of the additional program compatible application datasets e.g. Application dataset . If the SPTPResponse is generated by a remote agent e.g. agent then the remote agent returns the SPTPResponse e.g. SPTPResponse to agent . Agent returns the SPTP to metadata driven command processor for processing. Metadata driven command processor copies the contents of the Application dataset included in the SPTPResponse to Application dataset nested in Process dataset and continues processing.

If the SPTPRequest specifies a request to execute a statement included in the SPTPRequest then agent or the identified remote agent e.g. agent sends the statement e.g. statement or statement to identified resource or a remote resource e.g. 180 for execution. The executing resource may return a response e.g. response or response to the invoking agent. The invoking agent generates a SPTPResponse that includes a structured version of the resource response e.g. Data dataset . If the SPTPResponse is generated by a remote agent e.g. agent then the remote agent returns the SPTPResponse e.g. SPTPResponse to agent . Agent returns the SPTPResponse to metadata driven command processor for processing. Metadata driven command processor copies the contents of the Data dataset included in the SPTPResponse to Data dataset nested in Process dataset and continues processing.

If the SPTPRequest specifies a request to send a program loaded application s and current execution state from a remote machine e.g. machine then agent forwards the SPTPRequest e.g. SPTPRequest to the identified remote agent e.g. agent . The identified remote agent e.g. agent invokes the remote metadata driven command processor e.g. metadata driven command processor to return its Process dataset e.g. Process dataset which includes its program loaded application s and current execution state e.g. Message dataset Program dataset Application dataset and Data dataset . The remote agent generates a SPTPResponse that includes the Process dataset and returns the SPTPResponse e.g. SPTPResponse to agent . Agent returns the SPTPResponse to metadata driven command processor for processing. Metadata driven command processor copies the contents of the Process dataset included in the SPTPResponse to its Process dataset which includes the program loaded application s and current execution state within its nested Message dataset Program dataset Application dataset and Data dataset . Metadata driven command processor continues program processing from the execution state that existed on the remote machine.

In an embodiment metadata driven command processor generates or updates Process dataset from SPTPResponse or receives Process dataset through SPTPResponse transferred from Process dataset . illustrates SPTPResponse in more detail according to an embodiment. Process dataset generated by metadata driven command processor may contain the same defined schema as SPTPResponse or SPTPResponse . Thus the elements of Process dataset are simply populated from the elements of the dataset in SPTPResponse or SPTPResponse .

SPTPResponse dataset SPTPResponse dataset and Process dataset may each comprise a single row having four nested datasets Message dataset Program dataset Application dataset and Data dataset . In turn Program dataset may comprise a single row containing seven nested datasets Methods dataset MethodSteps dataset Transfers dataset TransferColumns dataset TransferConditions dataset TransferFormulas dataset and DatasetColumns dataset .

If the SPTPResponse includes a booting program and application metadata driven command processor generates Process dataset from SPTPResponse and then identifies a MethodID dataset element in a row of Methods dataset which is associated with booting. Next metadata driven command processor identifies one or more rows in the MethodSteps dataset that are associated with the identified MethodID dataset element. Metadata driven command processor processes these one or more rows by invoking a command that is associated to a CommandCode dataset element in each row. After completion of all the commands associated with applicable rows identified from the MethodSteps dataset metadata driven command processor maintains its state and waits for one of its commands to be invoked by agent based on a user event machine event or request from a remote agent.

 2 Conditionally append update or delete a dataset row based on the current value s of element s in one or more other datasets.

 3 Build a statement from the current values of dataset elements that is specific to a scripting language.

 4 Invoke an agent or remote agent to execute a statement via a compatible resource on the machine of the invoked agent. The response from the resource may be converted by the agent into a SPTPResponse that is processed by the metadata driven command processor.

 5 Transfer the Process dataset within the metadata driven command processor to a remote agent. This allows the remote agent s metadata driven command processor to continue program processing from its current state.

As mentioned above a dataset structure for an embodiment of a structured program transfer protocol is illustrated in . In this case the dataset structure includes nested relationships. SPTPRequest and SPTPResponse are both single row datasets. In an embodiment Message dataset Program dataset and Application dataset are each single row nested datasets within SPTPResponse and Data dataset is a multi row nested dataset within SPTPResponse .

In the illustrated embodiment Methods dataset MethodSteps dataset Transfers dataset TransferColumns dataset TransferConditions dataset TransferFormulas dataset and DatasetColumns dataset are all multi row nested datasets within Program nested dataset . Program dataset may also include one or more program specific nested datasets . The schema of Application dataset and its nested one or more datasets is program specific and may vary. Similarly the schema of Data dataset is statement specific and may vary.

In the illustrated embodiment of the column index CI of SPTPResponse is referred to as DSI dataset index . The column index of Program dataset and Application dataset is referred to as NDSI nested dataset index . The row index RI is zero for all single row datasets. Datasets may be created as two dimensional arrays. Elements within the datasets may be referenced using x y notation where x is the row index and y is the column index. For example the dataset element RequestType of an SPTPRequest in the illustrated embodiment of Table 1 may be referenced in an instruction set as SPTPRequest 0 0 . While row and column indexing are illustrated herein as zero based other index bases e.g. one based indexing are possible.

The following description illustrates a non limiting embodiment of a structured program transfer protocol request. The structured program transfer protocol request may comprise a single row SPTPRequest dataset which may be sent from an agent e.g. agent to a metadata driven command processor e.g. MCP from a metadata driven command processor e.g. MCP to an agent e.g. agent or from an agent e.g. agent to a remote agent e.g. agent or agent .

In an embodiment metadata driven command processor contains instruction sets in a programming language or machine language that is compatible with machine . The example instruction sets below illustrate non limiting examples of instruction sets using the JavaScript programming language. However it should be understood that any suitable alternative programming language or machine language may be utilized.

ProcessRequest command facilitates 1 loading of a booting program and application and 2 transferring a loaded program application s and their processing states to a metadata driven command processor on another machine. Instruction Set 1 of the example instruction sets below illustrates an example of how the functionality of ProcessRequest command may be implemented in JavaScript. ProcessRequest command may be invoked by the receive send monitor and booter components of an agent when a SPTPRequest is to be processed by metadata driven command processor . Based on the value of a RequestType element in the SPTPRequest dataset one of the following instruction sets may be executed 

 1 If RequestType is 0 a defined value representing a Load Booting Program and Application request type then ProcessRequest command resets the RequestType to 1 a defined value representing a Send Booting Program and Application request type invokes Send Receive command with the updated SPTPRequest to retrieve a booting program and application and creates an initial Process dataset from the returned SPTPResponse. ProcessRequest command then invokes ProcessEvent command to execute the booting method by setting command parameters as follows EventType 1 RecordID 0 and Value .

 2 If RequestType is 2 a defined value representing a Send Loaded Program and Applications request type then ProcessRequest command sets SPTPResponse to the Process dataset. Agent returns the SPTPResponse comprising the Process dataset to remote agent to allow the metadata driven command processor of remote agent to continue program processing from its current state.

ProcessEvent command identifies the method associated with a machine event and invokes CallMethod command to execute the identified method. Instruction Set 2 of the example instruction sets below illustrates an example of how the functionality of ProcessEvent command may be implemented in JavaScript. ProcessEvent command may be invoked by machine event handler of agent whenever a machine event is to be processed by metadata driven command processor . ProcessEvent command may also be conditionally invoked by ProcessRequest command and Send Receive command . ProcessEvent command may include the parameters shown in Table 22 

If the EventType parameter value is 3 a defined value for a Message event type before the Program dataset has been generated then ProcessEvent command generates a system level error message. Regardless of the value of the EventType parameter if the Program dataset has not been generated ProcessEvent command terminates its processing.

Otherwise the MethodID variable is set to the MethodID element value in the Methods dataset for the row in which the EventType element value matches the EventType parameter value. Then CallMethod command is invoked with the MethodID variable RecordID parameter and Value parameter values passed as the MethodID RecordID and Value parameters respectively for CallMethod command .

If the EventType parameter is set to 3 a defined value for a Message event type then the values for the MessageCode TypeCode Description and SourceCode elements in the Message dataset are cleared.

CallMethod command CommandCode 1 executes the rows within the MethodSteps dataset that are associated with a specific method. The MethodStep row execution invokes the command associated with a row when the row s condition if any is met. Instruction Set 3 of the example instructions sets below illustrates an example of how the functionality of CallMethod command may be implemented in JavaScript. CallMethod command may be invoked by user event handler of agent whenever a user event is to be processed by metadata driven command processor . CallMethod command may also be invoked by ProcessEvent command and conditionally invoked within the instruction set of CallMethod command . CallMethod command may include the parameters shown in Table 23 

CallMethod command updates the SPTPRequest dataset elements RecordID and Value from its RecordID and Value parameters respectively. CallMethod command then executes the rows within the MethodSteps dataset that are associated with the MethodID parameter. For each MethodStep row an instruction set represented by the following pseudocode may be performed 

TransferData command CommandCode 2 appends updates or deletes a dataset row based on the current values of another dataset row s elements. Instruction Set 4 of the example instruction sets below illustrates an example of how the functionality of TransferData command may be implemented in JavaScript. TransferData command may be conditionally invoked by CallMethod command and within the instruction set of TransferData command . TransferData command may include the parameter shown in Table 24 

TransferData command executes the row in the Transfers dataset that is associated with the TransferID parameter. The FromDataset variable is set to the Dataset identified from the FromDSI and FromNDSI elements values within the Transfers dataset. If the FromDSI value is 1 then the FromDataset is set to the SPTPRequest dataset. The ToDataset variable is set to the dataset identified from the ToDSI and ToNDSI elements values within the Transfers dataset. If to ToDSI value is 1 then the ToDataset is identified as the SPTPRequest dataset.

If the FromDataset is a single row then the FromRI variable is set to 0. Otherwise the FromRI variable is set to the row index within the FromDataset whose element values meet the criteria defined within the TransferConditions dataset rows that are associated with the TransferID parameter. For each matching row in the TransferConditions dataset an instruction set represented by the following pseudocode may be performed 

Based on the value of TransferType element of the Transfer dataset one of the following instruction sets is executed 

If TransferType is 1 or 2 defined values representing Append and Update respectively then for each row in the TransferColumns dataset that is associated with the TransferID parameter an instruction set represented by the following pseudocode may be performed 

TransferData command may invoke itself for each row in the Transfers dataset in which its ParentID element value matches the TransferID parameter. The matching row s TransferID element value is passed as the TransferID parameter.

ClearData command CommandCode 3 clears the data in a nested dataset contained within the Application dataset. Instruction Set 5 of the example instructions sets below illustrates an example of how the functionality of ClearData command may be implemented in JavaScript. ClearData command may be invoked by CallMethod command . ClearData command may include the parameter shown in Table 25 

Send Receive command CommandCode 4 may invoke resource handler of agent to 1 execute a statement using resource or 2 forward a SPTPRequest to remote agent for processing. Instruction Set 6 of the example instruction sets below illustrates an example of how the functionality of Send Receive command may be implemented in JavaScript. Send Receive command may conditionally update the Process dataset from the SPTPResponse. Send Receive command may be conditionally invoked by ProcessRequest command and CallMethod command .

In an embodiment based on the value of the RemoteConnectType element of the SPTPRequest dataset one of the following instructions sets is executed 

Resource handler creates a SPTPResponse dataset within metadata driven command processor based on the response from resource remote agent or remote resource . Send Receive command updates the Process dataset by setting the Message element of the Process dataset to the Message element of the SPTPRequest dataset.

If the MessageType element within the Message nested dataset is 1 a defined value representing Error then Send Receive command invokes ProcessEvent command passing the value 3 as the EventType parameter a defined value representing Message and terminates its processing. Otherwise Send Receive command updates the Process dataset by setting the Data element of the Process dataset to the Data element of the SPTPRequest dataset.

In an embodiment based on the value of the RequestType element of the SPTPRequest dataset one of the following instructions is executed 

As discussed above agent may comprise receive send monitor booter machine event handler user event handler and resource handler . In an embodiment receive send monitor monitors incoming requests from remote agents e.g. remote agent . When a SPTPRequest is received receive send monitor invokes a resource manager component of agent or the ProcessRequest command of metadata driven command processor based on the RequestType element. Receive send monitor creates a SPTPResponse based on the process results from resource handler or metadata driven command processor and returns the result to the requesting remote agent.

In an embodiment booter creates a booting SPTPRequest within metadata driven command processor and invokes ProcessRequest command of metadata driven command processor to load the booting program and application.

In an embodiment machine event handler invokes ProcessEvent command of metadata driven command processor when a machine event is to be processed by metadata driven command processor . For instance when a machine display size change event occurs machine event handler updates Width and Height elements within the SPTPRequest dataset of metadata driven command processor based on the new machine display size and sets the EventType parameter of ProcessEvent command to the value 2 a defined value for Screen Size Change .

In an embodiment user event handler invokes CallMethod command of metadata driven command processor when a user event occurs that is associated with a dynamic display rendering generated from a statement. Examples of user events include without limitation an OnClick event OnLostFocus event OnChange event etc.

In an embodiment resource handler is invoked by Send Receive command of metadata driven command processor to 1 execute a statement using resource or 2 forward a SPTPRequest to remote agent . Resource handler converts a response from resource or remote agent into a SPTPResponse that is processed by metadata driven command processor . The MessageCode MessageType Description and SourceCode elements in the Message nested dataset are set based on a system message e.g. error or alert in the response.

An implementation of a sample utility which utilizes an embodiment of the disclosed metadata driven command processor and structured program transfer protocol will now be described. The utility is a metadata driven database application whose booting program and application enable an end user of an end user device e.g. a type of a machine to add update delete view and navigate the same program and application metadata stored in a SQL relational database on a remote machine by rendering dynamic HTML content on the end user device based on user invoked events.

An agent contains an instruction set in a programming language or machine language that is compatible with a resource on an end user device or other machine. A sample agent instruction set is illustrated in Instruction Set 7 of the example instruction sets below. In this example the agent and MCP instruction sets are in the form of JavaScript. The MCP instruction set exists in a JS file in this example 10Data MCP.js that is referenced within the agent instruction set. The agent instruction set includes booter and resource handler components.

The booter creates a SPTPRequest within the metadata driven command processor that contains the dataset element values illustrated in Table 26A 

It should be understood that these values may alternatively be illustrated in a row column format as shown in Table 26B 

The booter invokes the ProcessRequest command of the metadata driven command processor. The ProcessRequest command updates the dataset element values in the SPTPRequest shown in Table 26C 

The booter invokes the Send Receive command. Then the Send Receive command invokes the agent s resource handler component. The resource handler forwards the SPTPRequest to the remote agent identified as SOAP based web service appCase.mobi . The remote agent creates a SPTPResponse that includes the booting program and application retrieved from a remote resource in the form of a SQL relational database. In this example the SPTPResponse has the nested Program dataset element values shown in Tables 27A 35B 

In this example the SPTPResponse has the nested program defined Application dataset element values shown in Tables 36A 44B. In this example the appConditions dataset in Table 42B does not contain any rows.

The resource handler returns control to the Send Receive command. The Send Receive command creates the Process dataset from the SPTPResponse and returns control to the ProcessRequest command. The ProcessRequest command then invokes the ProcessEvent command by calling ProcessEvent 1 0 i.e. passing parameters 1 0 and to subroutine ProcessEvent . In turn the ProcessEvent command invokes the CallMethod command by calling CallMethod 1 0 . The CallMethod command updates the SPTPRequest dataset element values from its parameters. After being updated by the CallMethod command the SPTPRequest contains the following updated values for column indices 10 and 12
