Despite advancements in screen technology screen burn in including image persistence can be a problem on display screens. In one example after a stationary or semi stationary image is displayed on a display screen and a partial or full screen re draw occurs the previous image may persist on the display screen. The cause of screen burn in may vary depending on the type of display screen. For instance liquid crystals have a natural relaxed state. When a voltage is applied the liquid crystals may be re arranged to block certain light waves. If the same voltage is applied for an extended period of time the liquid crystals tend to stay in that position. Image persistence may visibly occur when the pixels are used in inconsistence amounts e.g. a top left pixel is less likely to be changing as the pixel in the middle of the screen . In some cases television and display monitor manufacturers carefully limit their liability for these problems in their warranties.

In some conventional approaches screen savers are recommended to avoid potential screen burn in. However screen savers are typically activated after an extended idle time and may not be appropriate in certain types of environments such as kiosks display signs or panels billboards etc. Also screen savers may distract from viewing information that would otherwise be displayed on the display screen. In other conventional approaches to screen burn in software is provided that performs a white wipe e.g. a specialized screen saver that changes pixels on the display screen to completely white.

The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

According to an aspect an image degradation prevention module for reducing image degradation includes a screen region monitor configured to derive light information for each of a plurality of regions of a display screen an element movement detector configured to derive element motion information for a plurality of display elements displayed in the plurality of regions and a decision engine configured to select a corrective action among a plurality of corrective actions for at least one display element of the plurality of display elements to reduce image degradation based on the light information and the element motion information.

The decision engine may be configured to determine an impact of potential image degradation caused by each display element based on an evaluation of the light information and the element motion information. The decision engine may be configured to select the at least one display element as a candidate for causing image degradation based on the determined impact meeting a threshold level. The decision engine may include a score calculator configured to calculate a score for each display element based on an evaluation of the light information and the element motion information. The score may indicate a likelihood of a respective display element causing image degradation. The decision may include an action decider configured to select the at least one display element as a candidate for causing image degradation based on the calculated score meeting a threshold level and the action decider may be configured to select the corrective action among the plurality of corrective actions for the at least one display element based the calculated score for the at least one display element. The score calculator may calculate the score for each display element according to a scoring algorithm that includes weights applied to the rate of change in the light intensity of pixels for one or more regions that displays a respective display element and the rate of movement for each display element within the display screen. The decision engine may include an updater configured to update previous corrective action information with the selected corrective action and result information indicating whether the selective corrective action was effective or ineffective for reducing image degradation and the decision engine may be configured to select a subsequent corrective action based on an examination of the previous corrective action information.

According to an aspect a non transitory computer readable medium storing executable instructions that when executed by at least one processor are configured to derive light information for each of a plurality of regions of a display screen derive element motion information for a plurality of display elements displayed in the plurality of regions determine an impact of potential image degradation caused by each display element based on an evaluation of the light information and the element motion information select a corrective action among a plurality of corrective actions for at least one display element of the plurality of display elements based on the impact of potential image degradation caused by each display element apply the corrective action to the at least one display element and update the evaluation of the light information and the element motion information based on a result of the applied corrective action.

The embodiments may include one or more of the following features or any combination thereof . The executable instructions to derive light information may include executable instructions to detect the rate of change in the light intensity of pixels by recursively subdividing the display screen into the plurality of regions and determine a change of luminance of the pixels within each region over time. The executable instructions to derive light information may include executable instructions to derive light wavelength information indicating transitions in wavelengths over time. The executable instructions cause the at least one processor to derive event information for at least one user event that caused a rendering of the at least one display element and select the corrective action based on the event information the light information and the element motion information. The executable instructions to determine the impact of potential image degradation caused by each display element may include executable instructions to calculate a score for each display element based on a scoring algorithm that applies weights to metrics of the light information and the element motion information. The selected corrective action may indicate to change a luminance of the at least one display object or change a position of the at least one display object.

According to an aspect a method for reducing display screen burn in the method being performed by at least one processor may include selecting a first corrective action among a plurality of corrective actions for at least one display element displayed on a display screen according to decision making criteria applying the first corrective action to reduce potential image degradation caused by the at least one display element updating the decision making criteria with a result of the first corrective action selecting a second corrective action among the plurality of corrective actions for the at least one display element according to the updated decision making criteria and applying the second corrective action to reduce the potential image degradation caused by the at least one display element.

The embodiments may include one or more of the following features or any combination thereof . The selecting the first corrective action may include calculating a score indicating an impact of causing potential image degradation by the at least one display element by evaluating transitions in light intensity and wavelength over time and transitions in movement over time for the at least one display element and selecting the first corrective action based on the score. The selecting the first corrective action may include calculating a score according to a scoring algorithm that receives transitions in light intensity and wavelength over time and transitions in movement over time for the at least one display element and selecting the first corrective action based on the score where the updating the decision making criteria includes changing the scoring algorithm based on the results of the first corrective action. The method may include deriving luminance and movement history of the at least one display object where the first corrective action is selected based on an evaluation of the luminance and movement history within the decision making criteria. The first corrective action may indicate to change a luminance of the at least one display object and the second corrective action may indicate to change a position of the at least one display object. The method may include collecting information regarding a display of the at least one display element that has been rendered by Open Graphics Library open GL or other display technologies in response to a user request where the first corrective action is selected based on an evaluation of the collected information within the decision making criteria.

The image degradation prevention module may be configured to implement a self improving image degradation prevention algorithm that evaluates different regions for image degradation or screen burn in and which display elements would be effected by the different regions of image degradation and selects a corrective action among a plurality of corrective actions to reduce potential image degradation based on an outcome of the evaluation. For example according to the self improving image degradation prevention algorithm the image degradation prevention module may determine an impact of potential image degradation caused by each display element rendered on various regions of the display screen . The impact of image degradation may refer to a degree in which a corresponding display element may potentially cause screen burn in or image persistence e.g. a higher determined impact may indicate that the corresponding display object has an increased chance of causing image degradation . Stated another way the impact of potential image degradation may refer to the level relevance degree or importance the corresponding display object has in causing potential screen burn in or image persistence on the display screen .

In some examples the image degradation prevention module may derive or otherwise obtain luminance and movement history associated with each display element from at least one database and may determine the impact of potential image degradation based on the luminance and movement history such that the determined impact influences which display elements are selected as candidates for causing potential image degradation and which corrective action is selected for the at risk display elements . For instance the luminance and movement history may indicate how long each display element has been stationary in terms of movement and luminance. In some examples the image degradation prevention module may evaluate transitions in light intensity and or wavelength thus encapsulating color over time and transitions in display element movements over time in order to determine a relative impact of causing potential image degradation and dynamically select an effective corrective action to be applied to one or more display elements that are at risk for causing image degradation on their corresponding regions .

Furthermore the image degradation prevention module may obtain the results of the selected corrective action from the at least one database and the image degradation prevention module may use the results of the selected corrective action to update the decision making criteria for selecting future corrective actions. The results may indicate whether previously applied corrective actions were effective or ineffective for reducing image degradation. For example the image degradation prevention module may continue to collect and store luminance and movement information for the at risk display element after applying the corrective action and this information may be used to determine whether its impact of potential image degradation has increased decreased or remained substantially the same. If the impact of potential image degradation has decreased or decreased by a threshold amount the image degradation prevention module may determine that the previously selected corrective action was effective. If the impact of potential image degradation has increased increased by a threshold amount or remained the same the image degradation prevention module may determine that the previously selected corrective action was ineffective. In some examples the evaluation on how the impact is determined for each display element may be updated based on the results of previously applied corrective actions. As such the self improving image degradation prevention algorithm may evolve based on the corrective actions previously taken. Also the self improving image degradation prevention algorithm may evolve as further knowledge is gained regarding the history state of the display elements .

In some examples the self improving image degradation prevention algorithm implemented by the image degradation prevention module may decrease costs associated with purchasing new products to replace burnt in display monitors increase efficiency for users e.g. minimize or eliminate screen savers that distract the displaying of underlying information and or increase exposure time on large or outdoor video displays e.g. increased efficiency of display advertising . In some examples the self improving image degradation prevention algorithm may provide a more intelligent automatic and focused approach by determining which display elements to adapt or change and which display elements to leave alone in a manner that allows applications to interface with the display screen without the content rendering applications having any knowledge of these techniques. Also the display elements may be displayed in a manner that is relatively more in tune with the intention of the user or the application while reducing potential image degradation.

Each region may refer to a portion area or section of the display screen . In some examples the regions are rectangular or square. In other examples the regions have a non rectangular or non square shape. The display screen may be divided into any number of regions . Each region may represent one or more pixels of the display screen . For example each region may refer to an individual pixel or a group of pixels. The display screen may render imagery in the form of display elements in various regions of the display screen . Generally the display elements may refer to objects images or shapes of imagery rendered on the display screen . In some examples the display elements may be windows tabs objects such as rectangles or other non rectangular objects images and or user interface elements or objects. One or more of the display elements may be at risk for causing a temporary or permanent degradation of area s on the display screen . Some examples includes a degradation of image quality a temporary or permanent ghost like image of the display elements discolorations on one or more areas of the display screen color drifts e.g. where one or more colors becomes more prominent transient image persistence caused by charge build up in pixel cells among others. Again image degradation may refer to screen burn in and or image persistence. The exact cause for the creation of image degradation may vary depending on the type of display technology. In some examples when a particular display element is displayed on the display screen for a relatively long period of time one or more areas of the display screen may be degraded in some cases damaged leaving discolorations that could be temporary or permanent.

In order to evaluate which display elements are at risk for causing potential image degradation the image degradation prevention module may obtain one or more of the following information from the at least one database light information element motion information and event information . In some examples the image degradation prevention module obtains the light information and the element motion information . In other examples the image degradation prevention module obtains the light information the element motion information and the event information .

The light information may include light intensity information providing detected transitions of light intensity over time for each of the regions . For example the light information may reflect the luminance history of the pixels within the regions including when and how often the luminance changes over time. Also the light information may include wavelength transition information providing transitions of the wavelengths applied to the regions which may encapsulate when and how often color changes.

The image degradation prevention module may include a screen region monitor configured to derive the light information using any type of integrated hardware analysis on the various pixels of the regions of the display screen . For example the screen region monitor may track changes in light intensities and or wavelength transitions within the regions over time. As such the light information may indicate a rate of change in the light intensity of pixels within each region within a period of time and or the rate of change in terms of wavelength transitions. In some examples the rate of change in the light intensity and or wavelength transitions may indicate a level of static ness of the pixels within the region . In some examples the rate of change in the light intensity may indicate a level of change and or lack of change of the luminance and or wavelength of the pixels within the region . Stated another way the rate of change may indicate whether the luminance and or wavelengths of the pixels within the region has a relatively constant value over time.

The screen region monitor may be configured to detect the rate of change in the light intensity of pixels within a time period by recursively subdividing the display screen into a number of distinct regions and determining a change of luminance of the pixels within each region over time. For example the display screen may have any type of size ranging from relatively large display screen panels to relatively small display screens on mobile computing devices. In some examples the size e.g. width height of the display screen may be expressed in units of pixels e.g. 1024 768 . The screen region monitor may periodically detect the luminance of the pixels within each region over time and then determine the rate of change in light intensity by examining the luminance at each of the iterations. As such it may be determined whether the luminance for each region remained relatively the same over time which may factor into whether the display elements provided on these regions are more susceptible to potential image degradation.

In a further example at a first point in time the screen region monitor may divide the display screen into smaller distinct regions . In some examples the size of each region may be the same. In other examples the size of some regions may be larger than the size of other regions . Each region may be associated with a particular portion of the display screen . Then the screen region monitor may detect the luminance of the pixel s within each region . In some examples a luminance value may be associated with each pixel and if a region includes multiple pixels the image degradation prevention module may determine the average luminance of the pixels within the region .

At a second point in time the screen region monitor may divide the display screen into the same regions and then detect the luminance of the pixels within each region . Then with respect to a particular region the screen region monitor may determine the rate of change in light intensity by examining the luminance at the first point in time for the region with the luminance for the region at the second point in time. In some examples the screen region monitor may determine the rate of change in light intensity after performing more than two iterations. Also the screen region monitor may be configured to obtain the wavelength transition information providing transitions of wavelengths over time in the same or similar manner as described above and below with respect to the light intensity of pixels.

The image degradation prevention module may be configured to obtain the element motion information from the at least one database . The element motion information may include movement history associated with the display elements . For example the element motion information may provide transitions of the display elements to various positions on the display screen over time. In particular the image degradation prevention module may be configured to detect the shapes and positions of the display elements and then determine their movements within the display screen over time.

The image degradation prevention module may include an element movement detector configured to derive the element motion information . For example the element movement detector may be configured to detect the display elements rendered within the regions of the display screen using any type of object detection technique on the display elements . In some examples the element movement detector may detect the shapes and positions of the display elements based on corner point detection. Then the element movement detector may track the movements of the detected display elements over time to create the element motion information .

The element motion information may indicate a rate of movement of each display element within the display screen within a period of time. In some examples the rate of movement may indicate a level of static ness of the display element in terms of movement within the period of time. In some examples the rate of movement may indicate a degree of movement or lack of movement of the display element within the display screen over time. Stated another way the rate of movement may indicate whether the display element has remained in a same location on the display screen whether the display element has moved to another location or multiple locations and or how often the display element moves over time. Also the element motion information may provide an initial location of the display element within the display screen an amount of time which the display element was stationary at the initial location and if the display element has moved a secondary location of the display element within the display screen as well as the amount of time which the display element was stationary at the secondary location and so forth if the display element has moved to other locations . Further the element motion information may specify the direction s in which the display element has moved.

If allowed or permitted by the user the image degradation prevention module may obtain the event information from the at least one database in order to supplement the element motion information and the light information . The event information may provide display information of the display elements in response to user events that draws or re draws the display elements on the display screen . For example the event information may include information regarding the display of the display elements that have been rendered by Open Graphics Library open GL or other display technologies based on individual user requests. In some examples the event information may include information similar to the element motion information and or the light information . In some examples the event information may include the size and or shape of the display elements which positions the display elements are drawn and or pixel luminance information for the pixels within the respective regions of the display screen .

The image degradation prevention module may include an event collector configured to derive the event information . In some examples the event information may be captured from application programming interface API attributes from an underlying source application. In a non limiting example a user may open draw a browser window and the browser window may be displayed on the display screen . Then the user may redraw the displayed window to a different part of the display screen . As such if allowed the event collector may collect information related to the draw and re draw events such as pixel value information the positions on the display screen which the display elements are drawn when the draw and re draw events have occurred and an amount of time the display elements were displayed. It is noted that the user may opt out of the functionalities of the event collector such that information related to the user events are not collected.

The event collector may derive the event information without having to perform an integrated hardware analysis since this type of information may reside in the software layer in the device rendering the display elements for display. As such the image degradation prevention module can collect information from different levels of technology perspectives e.g. the event information from the software layer and the information from the hardware layer . As a result the determination of a relative impact or an effective corrective action may be improved by the richness of information collected from the various levels. Furthermore over time the image degradation prevention module obtains more information regarding the history of light intensity transitions wavelength transitions and transitions in display object movements which as a result improves the accuracy of determining the appropriate impact of potential image degradation for the display elements thereby increasing the chance that the more effective corrective action will be selected.

The image degradation prevention module may include a decision engine configured to apply decision making criteria in order to select the corrective action among a plurality of corrective actions for one or more at risk display element to assist in reducing potential image degradation based on the information and or . The decision making criteria may reflect how the impact of potential image degradation caused by each display element is determined in order to identify which display elements are at risk for causing potential image degradation and how the corrective action is selected. Then after selecting the appropriate corrective action the decision engine may apply the selected corrective action .

In some examples the decision engine may identify one or more display elements that are potential candidates for causing image degradation based on the information and or . In some examples for all the display elements rendered on the display screen the decision engine may identify one or a subset of the display elements that are at risk for causing image degradation. In some examples the decision engine may determine an impact of each display element for causing image degradation based on the information and or and then if the impact is relatively high for a particular display element the decision engine may determine that this display element is a candidate to take corrective action .

In some examples the decision engine may include a score calculator configured to compute a score for each of the display elements based on the information and or . Each score may indicate a degree of causing image degradation within one or more of the regions e.g. the higher the score the more likely the potential for causing image degradation . In other words the score may indicate a likelihood of causing image degradation by a corresponding display element . In some examples the score calculator may compute the score based on the display element s rate of change in the light intensity and or rate of wavelength transitions of pixels over time from the light information the display element s rate of movement from the element motion information and or the display element s event information . In some examples the score calculator may compute the score using a weighted scoring algorithm that applies weights to the metrics from the information and . If the score for a particular display element is equal to or above a threshold value the decision engine may identify that display object as a candidate for potentially causing image degradation such that a corrective action may be taken with respect to that display element .

The decision engine may include an action decider configured to select the corrective action among a plurality of corrective action based on the computed scores . Each of the plurality of corrective actions may refer to a different action to be applied in order to assist in reducing image degradation e.g. change luminance of pixels within one or more display elements or one or more regions change the position of one or more display elements deactivate one or more areas of the display screen etc. . The action decider may dynamically select the corrective action among the plurality of corrective actions such that the selected corrective action may be relatively more effective in reducing image degradation than other non selected corrective actions.

In some examples the scores may provide a basis for the corrective action selection. For example the action decider may select a first corrective action if the score for the display element is equal to or above a first value and may select a second corrective action different than the first corrective action if the score for the display element is equal to or above a second value e.g. the second value being higher than the first value . For example a score or a range of scores may be associated with a particular corrective action. As such if the computed score meets or falls within score s associated with a type of corrective action the action decider may select that corrective action to be applied the at risk display element .

Also in conjunction with the scores the action decider may select the corrective action for the one or more at risk display elements by examining previous corrective action information indicating which previously applied corrective actions were effective or ineffective for reducing potential screen burn in. For example in order to determine an effective corrective action for one or more at risk display elements e.g. having calculated scores equal to or above a threshold value the action decider may consult the previous corrective action information by examining which previous corrective actions were effective. For example the previous corrective action information may provide the corrective actions taken at previous times. In some examples the previous corrective action information may indicate which corrective actions were taken with respect to the display elements . Also the previous corrective action information may indicate the factors e.g. the rate of change of light intensity the rate of wavelength transitions the rate of movement of the display elements the event information etc. that caused the action decider to previously select that particular corrective action. Further the previous corrective action information may indicate whether the previous corrective actions were effective for reducing image degradation. For example the previous corrective action information may include the information and or at subsequent times after the previous corrective action was applied which may indicate whether the previous corrective action was effective e.g. determining whether any of the described information has changed in a manner that would indicate that image degradation was reduced .

In some examples the action decider may determine if any previous corrective actions were taken with respect to the candidate display element . If so in some examples the action decider may determine how long ago the previous corrective action was taken. Also if a previous corrective action was taken with respect to the display element the action decider may select another corrective action if that previous corrective action was taken a relatively short time ago e.g. less than a threshold time period . In other examples the action decider may examine the previous corrective actions for other display elements having similar scores to identify a previous corrective action that was effective under the similar conditions. Also the action decider may determine multiple corrective actions to different or same display elements .

Then the decision engine may apply the selected corrective action . As indicated above the determined corrective action may include moving the display element from a first displayed position to a second displayed position or adjusting the luminance of one or more pixels within the display elements . In some examples the decision engine may update the previous corrective action information and or the decision making criteria with the results of the applied corrective action .

The decision engine may include an updater configured to update the previous corrective action information and or the decision making criteria with the results of the applied corrective action . The results may indicate whether the previously applied corrective action was effective or ineffective. In some examples the updater may update the previous corrective action information with the selected corrective action and the conditions or factors that caused the action decider to select that particular corrective action . Also in some examples the updater may update or replace the previous corrective action information with information indicating whether the previous corrective action was effective or ineffective e.g. determining whether any of the described information has changed in a manner that would indicate that image degradation was reduced such at the rates of luminance or movement has decreased or determining whether the score has increased or decreased .

Also the updater may adjust e.g. modify the decision selection criteria of the decision engine based on the previous corrective action information such that a different corrective action is selected that is considered relatively more effective. In some examples the updater may adjust how the impact of image degradation is determined. In some examples the updater may adjust the scoring algorithm e.g. adjusting the weights implemented by the score calculator based on the previous corrective action information . As such the dynamic evaluation and selection of corrective actions may improve over time as the decision engine learns more about what corrective actions were effective or ineffective.

The image degradation prevention module may include at least one processor and a non transitory computer readable medium storing executable instructions that when executed by the at least one processor are configured to implement the image degradation prevention module and the functionalities described herein. The non transitory computer readable medium may include one or more non volatile memories including by way of example semiconductor memory devices e.g. EPROM EEPROM and flash memory devices magnetic disks e.g. internal hard disks or removable disks magneto optical disks and CD ROM and DVD ROM disks. The at least one processor may include one or more computer processing units CPUs such as any type of general purpose computing circuitry or special purpose logic circuitry e.g. an FPGA field programmable gate array or an ASIC application specific integrated circuit . Also the at least one processor may include one or more processors coupled to a semiconductor substrate. Also the image degradation prevention module may include at least one database configured to store the light information the element motion information the event information the previous corrective action information and the scores . The at least one database may include one more database structures implemented on the non transitory computer readable medium .

Light information may be derived . For example the screen region monitor may be configured to derive the light information using any type of integrated hardware analysis on the various pixels of the regions of the display screen . For example the screen region monitor may track changes in light intensities and wavelength within the regions over time. As such the light information may indicate a rate of change in the light intensity of pixels within each region over time as well as the rate of change in wavelengths applied to the pixels within each region over time. In some examples the screen region monitor may be configured to detect the rate of change in the light intensity and wavelengths of pixels over time by recursively subdividing the display screen into a number of distinct regions and determining a change of luminance of the pixels within each region over time.

Event information may be collected . If allowed or permitted by the user the image degradation prevention module e.g. the event collector may obtain the event information in order to supplement the element motion information and the light information . The event information may relate to the display of the display elements based on user events that draws or re draws the display elements on the display screen . For example the event information may include information regarding the display of the display elements that have been rendered by Open Graphics Library open GL or other display technologies based on individual user requests. In some examples the event information may include information similar to the element motion information and or the light information . In some examples the event information may include the size and or shape of the display elements which positions the display elements are drawn and or pixel luminance information for the pixels within the respective regions of the display screen .

Element motion information may be derived . For example the element movement detector configured to derive the element motion information . For example the element movement detector may be configured to detect the display elements rendered within the regions of the display screen using any type of object detection technique on the display elements . In some examples the element movement detector may detect the shapes and positions of the display elements based on corner point detection. Then the element movement detector may track the movements of the detected display elements over time to create the element motion information . The element motion information may indicate a rate of movement of the display element within the display screen over time.

Scores for detected display elements may be calculated . In some example the score calculator may be configured to compute the score for each of the display elements based on the information and or . Each score may indicate a degree of causing image degradation within one or more of the regions e.g. the higher the score the more likely the potential for causing screen burn in or image persistence . In other words the score may indicate a likelihood of causing image degradation by a corresponding display element . In some examples the score calculator may compute the score based on the display element s rate of change in the light intensity of pixels over time from the light information the display element s rate of movement from the element motion information and or the display element s event information . In some examples the score calculator may compute the score using a weighted scoring algorithm that applies weights to the metrics from the information and .

A corrective action may be selected based on the calculated scores . For example the action decider may be configured to select the corrective action among a plurality of corrective action based on the computed scores . The action decider may dynamically select the corrective action among the plurality of corrective actions such that the selected corrective action may be relatively more effective in reducing image degradation than other non selected corrective actions. In some examples the scores may provide a basis for the corrective action selection. Also in some examples in conjunction with the scores the action decider may select the corrective action for the one or more at risk display elements by examining previous corrective action information indicating which previously applied corrective actions were effective or ineffective for reducing potential image degradation. Then the decision engine may apply the selected corrective action . As indicated above the determined corrective action may include moving the display element from a first displayed position to a second displayed position or adjusting the luminance of one or more pixels within the display elements .

The algorithm may be updated with results of corrective action . For example the updater may adjust the decision selection criteria of the decision engine based on the previous corrective action information such that a different corrective action is selected that is considered relatively more effective. In some examples the updater may adjust how the impact of image degradation is determined. In some examples the updater may adjust the scoring algorithm e.g. adjusting the weights implemented by the score calculator based on the previous corrective action information . As such the dynamic evaluation and selection of corrective actions may improve over time as the decision engine learns more about what corrective actions were effective or ineffective.
