It is critical that ambulances fire trucks police cars and other emergency vehicles be able to navigate quickly and safely to emergency locations in order to provide life saving services. Such emergency vehicles oftentimes encounter heavy traffic areas and challenging road conditions particularly in metropolitan areas. For example ambulances must often weave between cars to get to a particular location.

Drivers of non emergency vehicles currently move to the side of the road only after seeing emergency vehicle lights or hearing emergency vehicle sirens. In other words drivers respond to emergency vehicles in a very reactionary way and not in a coordinated or premeditated manner. However lights and sirens are rarely noticed when an emergency vehicle is a significant enough distance away from the vehicles to provide the vehicles sufficient time to efficiently pave a lane for the emergency vehicle. Instead the lights and sirens are typically noticed only a few hundred feet away from the vehicles and if the emergency vehicle is approaching an intersection from a crossroad a much shorter distance or not at all. As such emergency vehicles may spend a significant amount of time simply waiting for non emergency vehicles to move before proceeding to the emergency location.

In some embodiments one or more of the in vehicle computing systems may be alternatively embodied as a mobile computing device e.g. a smartphone or wearable computing device of the vehicle driver or passenger .

Referring now to in use the in vehicle computing system of the emergency vehicle establishes an environment for reporting travel routes of the emergency vehicle to the cloud server . The illustrative environment of the in vehicle computing system includes a route reporting module and a communication module . Each of the modules of the environment may be embodied as hardware firmware software or a combination thereof. Additionally in some embodiments one or more of the illustrative modules may form a portion of another module and or one or more of the illustrative modules may be embodied as a standalone or independent module. For example each of the modules logic and other components of the environment may form a portion of or otherwise be established by the processor of the in vehicle computing system .

The route reporting module determines the travel route of the emergency vehicle and a route privacy policy associated with the travel route. It should be appreciated that the travel route of the emergency vehicle may be predetermined based on the current location of the emergency vehicle the emergency destination contextual information e.g. time of day traffic patterns season weather etc. and or other suitable information. Further the travel route may be calculated in real time and or periodically updated e.g. based on changes in location direction overall route and or other travel characteristics . In some embodiments the travel route of the emergency vehicle may be extracted from navigation system of the in vehicle computing system . As described below the route privacy policy indicates the authorized scope of disclosure of the travel route of the emergency vehicle to other vehicles e.g. non emergency vehicles . In the illustrative embodiment the route reporting module determines whether to authorize the cloud server to transmit the entire travel route of the emergency vehicle or only a portion of the travel route. In particular the route privacy policy may establish various conditions or criteria associated with the disclosure of the travel route. For example the route privacy policy may indicate that the cloud server is authorized to transmit to a particular vehicle only the portion of the travel route of the emergency vehicle that is between the emergency vehicle and the vehicle .

The communication module handles the communication between the in vehicle computing system of the emergency vehicle and remote computing devices e.g. the cloud server through the network . For example as described herein the communication module may report the travel route of the emergency vehicle to the cloud server for subsequent transmission or partial transmission to other vehicles . In doing so the communication module may also transmit the route privacy policy of the emergency vehicle associated with the current travel route of the emergency vehicle .

Referring now to in use the cloud server establishes an environment for reporting travel routes of emergency vehicles to other vehicles . The illustrative environment of the cloud server includes a route management module a vehicle identification module and a communication module . Each of the modules of the environment may be embodied as hardware firmware software or a combination thereof. Additionally in some embodiments one or more of the illustrative modules may form a portion of another module and or one or more of the illustrative modules may be embodied as a standalone or independent module. For example each of the modules logic and other components of the environment may form a portion of or otherwise be established by a processor of the cloud server .

The route management module determines the travel routes of emergency vehicles and the scope of disclosure of those travel routes i.e. how much travel route information to disclose based on emergency vehicle route data received from those emergency vehicles e.g. via the communication module . In some embodiments the route management module may receive store update and or otherwise utilize the route privacy policies of the emergency vehicles in determining the extent of disclosure e.g. full vs. partial of the travel routes of the emergency vehicles to other vehicles . Depending on the particular embodiment the route management module may utilize for example a different route privacy policy for each emergency vehicle a different route privacy policy for each particular route of an emergency vehicle the same route privacy policy for each emergency vehicle or type of emergency vehicle e.g. police car fire truck ambulance etc. .

The vehicle identification module determines which vehicles to which to convey the travel route of the emergency vehicles . In some embodiments the vehicle identification module determines which vehicles are likely to encounter a particular emergency vehicle based on the travel route of that emergency vehicle . For example the vehicle identification module may identify vehicles nearby or within a threshold distance region of the emergency vehicle e.g. within a few hundred feet within a mile within several miles within a defined geographical region etc. . Further in some embodiments the vehicle identification module may determine inertial characteristics of vehicles to determine whether the emergency vehicle is likely to cross paths with particular vehicles . For example if the emergency vehicle and vehicle are moving toward one another or toward some cross section or other intersection point the vehicles may be more likely to encounter one another than if the vehicles are moving in opposite directions. It should be appreciated that a possible intersection point of the emergency vehicle and the vehicle may be an intersection of two cross streets a point on a single one way or two way street or another suitable intersection point.

The communication module handles the communication between the cloud server and remote computing devices e.g. the in vehicle computing systems through the network . For example as described herein the communication module may receive the emergency vehicle route data from the emergency vehicle or more particularly the in vehicle computing system and transmit the relevant travel route data e.g. full or partial route information of the emergency vehicle to one or more in vehicle computing systems of vehicles identified selected by the cloud server .

Referring now to in use the in vehicle computing system of the vehicle establishes an environment for predicting travel routes of emergency vehicles . The illustrative environment of the in vehicle computing system includes a route determination module an intersection determination module a driver notification module and a communication module . Additionally the route determination module includes a context module . Each of the modules of the environment may be embodied as hardware firmware software or a combination thereof. Additionally in some embodiments one or more of the illustrative modules may form a portion of another module and or one or more of the illustrative modules may be embodied as a standalone or independent module. For example each of the modules logic and other components of the environment may form a portion of or otherwise be established by the processor of the in vehicle computing system .

The route determination module determines the anticipated travel route of the vehicle . In some embodiments the route determination module retrieves the travel route of the vehicle from a navigation system of the in vehicle computing system or otherwise determines a predefined travel route of the vehicle . However in other embodiments there may not be a predefined travel route stored on the memory of the in vehicle computing system . For example the driver may be operating the vehicle to travel to a known location having a route committed to memory. As such in some embodiments the route determination module may otherwise determine the travel route of the vehicle . For example the route determination module may determine the travel route of the vehicle based on a context of the vehicle historical route data and or other suitable information. The historical route data may be embodied as any data associated with a past travel route of the vehicle and or a particular driver of the vehicle . The context module determines the context of the vehicle at a particular point in time. For example the context module may analyze data collected by sensors of the in vehicle computing system and or other information useful in determining the travel route of the vehicle .

The intersection determination module determines an intersection point of the travel route of a particular emergency vehicle and the travel route of the vehicle . For example in some embodiments the intersection determination module determines a time and location at which the vehicle is expected to encounter the emergency vehicle . In some embodiments the intersection determination module compares the travel routes of the vehicles to make such a determination. Further the intersection determination module may also consider the real time location and or inertial characteristics e.g. speed of the vehicles in some embodiments.

The driver notification module alerts the driver of the vehicle of possible encounters with emergency vehicles . To do so the driver notification module may for example display the travel route of one or more emergency vehicles and or determined intersection points of the vehicle with emergency vehicles on a display of the in vehicle computing system e.g. on a navigation system . Further in some embodiments the driver notification module may provide one or more alternative routes for the vehicle in order to avoid an encounter with the emergency vehicle . It should be appreciated that the driver notification module may be integrated with a mapping service or provide an application programming interface API to a mapping service of the vehicle in order to provide such alerts and or reporting of the travel routes of emergency vehicles . In some embodiments the driver notification module notifies the driver of possible encounters e.g. intersection points or travel routes of multiple emergency vehicles near the vehicle or otherwise within some threshold distance region of the vehicle .

The communication module handles the communication between the in vehicle computing system and remote computing devices e.g. the cloud server through the network . For example as described herein the communication module may receive information associated with the travel route of one or more emergency vehicles e.g. full or partial route data which is used to predict determine possible encounters with emergency vehicles .

Referring now to in use the in vehicle computing system may execute a method for reporting travel routes of the emergency vehicle to the cloud server . The illustrative method begins with block of in which the in vehicle computing system determines a travel route of the emergency vehicle . In doing so in block the in vehicle computing system may receive sensor data from the sensors of the in vehicle computing system in some embodiments. As described above in some embodiments the travel route of the emergency vehicle may be a predetermined route. For example the in vehicle computing system may utilize a navigation system or mapping service to generate a travel route to an emergency location or other destination. In some embodiments the in vehicle computing system may utilize the location of the emergency vehicle the destination and contextual information to determine the travel route which may be stored and or rendered on a display for the driver s viewing. In other embodiments the in vehicle computing system may utilize a known destination and analytical probabilistic techniques to determine the most likely travel route of the emergency vehicle .

It should be appreciated that in some embodiments various emergency vehicles may have an interest in maintaining the privacy of their travel routes. For example police cars may completely restrict access to travel routes when responding to an active crime but may not do so when responding to emergencies unrelated to crimes e.g. traffic accidents . However in some embodiments a particular type of emergency vehicles may not restrict access to travel routes at all e.g. ambulances and or fire trucks .

In block the in vehicle computing system determines a route privacy policy corresponding with the current travel route of the emergency vehicle . In doing so the in vehicle computing system determines the authorized scope of disclosure of the travel route of the emergency vehicle in block . In other words the in vehicle computing system determines the extent to which the cloud server is authorized to disclose the travel route of the emergency vehicle once the travel route has been transmitted to the cloud server . In some embodiments the in vehicle computing system may authorize the cloud server to provide other vehicles e.g. non emergency vehicles with the entire travel route of the emergency vehicle whereas in other embodiments the in vehicle computing system may only authorize the cloud server to reveal certain portions of the travel route of the emergency vehicle e.g. depending on the particular vehicle . For example the route privacy policy may indicate that the cloud server is authorized to transmit to a particular vehicle only the portion of the travel route of the emergency vehicle that is between the emergency vehicle and the vehicle . In other embodiments the route privacy policy may be otherwise defined to limit or minimize the disclosure of the travel route to portions necessary to predicting encounters by corresponding vehicles . For example the vehicles may not need to know anything regarding the travel route of the emergency vehicle if they are beyond a particular threshold distance from the emergency vehicle e.g. travel routes for emergency vehicles in Queens of New York City are irrelevant to vehicles in Staten Island of New York City .

In block the in vehicle computing system reports route data of the emergency vehicle to the cloud server . In doing so in block the in vehicle computing system transmits the determined travel route of the emergency vehicle to the cloud server . Additionally in block the in vehicle computing system transmits the route privacy policy associated with the travel route to the cloud server . It should be appreciated that in some embodiments the emergency vehicle utilizes the same route privacy policy or collection of route privacy policies for all travel routes of the emergency vehicle . In such embodiments the in vehicle computing system may transmit the route privacy policies to the cloud server once and indicate which should be used for a particular travel route. In block the in vehicle computing system may also transmit sensor data of the emergency vehicle to the cloud server e.g. location inertial data and or other sensor data . For example the sensor data may be utilized in determining the vehicles to which to transmit the travel route of the emergency vehicle . It should be appreciated that in the illustrative embodiment the travel route of the emergency vehicle is determined and transmitted in real time and the in vehicle computing system may periodically update the cloud server regarding any changes e.g. while the emergency vehicle travels along the travel route . For example the in vehicle computing system may update the cloud server regarding changes in location direction overall route and or other travel characteristics.

Referring now to in use the cloud server may execute a method for reporting travel routes of emergency vehicles to other vehicles . The illustrative method begins with block of in which the cloud server receives emergency vehicle route data from an emergency vehicle that identifies an anticipated travel route of the emergency vehicle . Further in block the cloud server receives the route privacy policy of the emergency vehicle associated with the travel route of the emergency vehicle . As discussed above in some embodiments the route privacy policy may also be stored on the cloud server in which case the cloud server may retrieve the route privacy policy associated with the emergency vehicle travel route. As described above in block the cloud server may also receive sensor data of the emergency vehicle in some embodiments.

In block the cloud server determines the scope of disclosure of the determined travel route of the emergency vehicle based on the route privacy policy associated with that travel route of the emergency vehicle . In other words the cloud server determines the extent to which it should disclose the travel route of the emergency vehicle to other vehicles . For example as discussed above the cloud server may determine to disclose the entire travel route of the emergency vehicle to other vehicles in block . Alternatively in block the cloud server may determine to disclose a partial travel route of the emergency vehicle to other vehicles based on the route privacy policy . For example the route privacy policy may indicate that the cloud server is only authorized to transmit the portion of the travel route of the emergency vehicle to a particular vehicle that is between the vehicle and the emergency vehicle . As such it should be appreciated that the route privacy policy may indicate that different portions of the travel route of the emergency vehicle are to be transmitted to corresponding vehicles . That is a first vehicle and a second vehicle may be authorized to receive different portions of the travel route of the emergency vehicle in some embodiments.

In block the cloud server determines the vehicles to which to convey the travel route of the emergency vehicle . It should be appreciated that the cloud server may utilize any suitable techniques algorithms and or mechanisms for making such a determination. For example in block the cloud server may identify vehicles nearby the emergency vehicle or otherwise within a threshold distance or region from the emergency vehicle e.g. within a few hundred feet within a mile within several miles within a defined geographical region etc. . In block the cloud server may identify vehicles with travel routes that are likely to intersect the travel route of the emergency vehicle . For example in some embodiments the cloud server may retrieve travel routes of nearby vehicles e.g. via a mapping service API navigation system data inertial characteristics and or other suitable travel data to determine whether the emergency vehicle is likely to cross paths with particular vehicles . Of course the cloud server may utilize any suitable analytical or probabilistic tools to draw such conclusions depending on the particular embodiment. For example if the emergency vehicle and vehicle are moving toward one another or toward some cross section or other intersection point the vehicles may be more likely to encounter one another than if the vehicles are moving in opposite directions. It should be appreciated that in determining which vehicles to which to convey the travel route of the emergency vehicle the cloud server may also determine the corresponding portion of the travel route to convey to each particular vehicle based on the route privacy policy as discussed above.

In block the cloud server determines whether any vehicles have been identified to which to convey the emergency vehicle travel route. If so in block the cloud server selects an identified vehicle . In block the cloud server transmits the portion s of the travel route of the emergency vehicle to the selected vehicle that are authorized by the corresponding route privacy policy . In some embodiments the cloud server may transmit one or more alternative routes for the selected vehicle to take in order to avoid encountering the emergency vehicle in block . In block the cloud server determines whether there are any identified vehicles remaining to which the cloud server has not yet transmitted the relevant travel route data of the emergency vehicle . If so the method returns to block in which the cloud server selects another identified vehicle . If not the method returns to block in which the cloud server waits to receive further route data from the emergency vehicle or a different emergency vehicle . It should be appreciated that the cloud server may periodically or continuously receive travel route data from one or more emergency vehicles and update the relevant vehicles of any changes in the travel route of the emergency vehicles . Further depending on the circumstances the particular vehicles that are authorized to receive the travel route data and or the portions of the travel route that those vehicles are authorized to receive may vary over time. For example a particular vehicle may take an unexpected turn such that it is no longer likely to encounter the emergency vehicle in which case the cloud server may determine not to provide the travel route data to that vehicle based on the route privacy policy .

Referring now to in use the in vehicle computing system of the vehicle may execute a method for predicting travel routes of emergency vehicles for the driver of the vehicle . The illustrative method begins with block of in which the in vehicle computing system determines whether any emergency vehicles are nearby or within some threshold distance of the vehicle . It should be appreciated that in some embodiments the cloud server and or the in vehicle computing system may determine whether the vehicle and the emergency vehicle are within some threshold distance of one another for route reporting purposes. For example in some embodiments the cloud server may determine to report the entire travel route of the emergency vehicle to any interested vehicles . In such embodiments the vehicle may filter out travel routes of emergency vehicles that are outside the threshold distance or otherwise determined to be unnecessary by the in vehicle computing system . In some embodiments filter parameters thresholds and or other such data may be user configurable e.g. by the driver of the vehicle .

If the in vehicle computing system determines there are emergency vehicles nearby the vehicle or within some threshold distance region of the vehicle or otherwise determines to receive travel route data of one or more emergency vehicles from the cloud server the in vehicle computing system receives a travel route of an emergency vehicle from the cloud server in block . In particular as discussed above the in vehicle computing system may receive the entire travel route of the emergency vehicle in block . Alternatively in block the in vehicle computing system may receive a partial travel route of the emergency vehicle . Further in block the in vehicle computing system may receive one or more alternative travel routes for the vehicle in order to avoid an encounter with the emergency vehicle in some embodiments.

In block the in vehicle computing system determines the anticipated travel route of the vehicle . For example in block the in vehicle computing system may determine a predefined travel route of the vehicle . For example the in vehicle computing system may retrieve the travel route of the vehicle from a navigation system in some embodiments. As discussed above in some embodiments there may not be a predefined travel route stored on the memory of the in vehicle computing system . In such embodiments the in vehicle computing system may determine the travel route of the vehicle based on any suitable algorithms techniques and or mechanisms. In block the in vehicle computing system may determine the travel route of the vehicle based on the context of the vehicle and or historical route data stored on the in vehicle computing system . For example the historical route data may identify past travel routes of the vehicle and or a particular driver of the vehicle . The context of the vehicle may be determined based on data collected by the sensors of the in vehicle computing system data collected from a mapping service or remote devices regarding the environment of the in vehicle computing system and or other information useful in determining the travel route of the vehicle . It should be appreciated that in some embodiments the in vehicle computing system may leverage the context data the historical route data and or other suitable information to determine the most likely travel route of the vehicle . For example the in vehicle computing system may determine from the sensor data e.g. location and time and the historical route data that the driver is on her way to work. It should further be appreciated that in some embodiments the in vehicle computing system may consider multiple likely travel routes of the vehicle and analyze each of those travel routes to identify likely encounters with an emergency vehicle as described herein.

In block the in vehicle computing system determines any likely intersection points of the travel route of the emergency vehicle with the travel route of the vehicle . In particular in block the in vehicle computing system may determine the time and location at which the vehicle is likely to encounter the emergency vehicle in some embodiments. For example the in vehicle computing system may compare the travel route of the emergency vehicle known to the in vehicle computing system e.g. if only a partial travel route is known to the determined travel route of the vehicle to determine whether the travel routes have any locations in common. If so the in vehicle computing system may further determine the times at which the emergency vehicle and the vehicle are expected to arrive at the common locations e.g. based on inertial characteristics traffic patterns and or other context data . If the vehicles are expected to arrive at any particular location at approximately the same time the vehicles will likely encounter one another at that location. It should be appreciated that the intersection points of the travel routes of the vehicles may change over time depending on the particular embodiment.

In block the in vehicle computing system determines whether any intersection points between the travel route of the vehicle and the travel route of the emergency vehicle have been identified. If so the in vehicle computing system alerts the driver of the vehicle of the possible or likely encounter with the emergency vehicle in block . In doing so the in vehicle computing system may display the travel route of the emergency vehicle and or any determined intersection points of the vehicles on a display of the in vehicle computing system e.g. on a navigation system heads up display HUD or other display of the in vehicle computing system in block . Further in block the in vehicle computing system may provide one or more alternative routes for the vehicle in order to avoid an encounter with the emergency vehicle . For example the in vehicle computing system may display alternative travel routes received from the cloud server and or independently identify alternative travel routes. Although the alert message are described herein primarily with respect to visual alerts in other embodiments the alert messages may be provided by virtue of audio messages. Further in some embodiments the in vehicle computing system may provide the alert messages on a mobile computing device of the driver e.g. a wearable computing device or smartphone .

Of course in some embodiments the vehicle may be likely to encounter multiple emergency vehicles such as for example emergency vehicles approaching a common emergency location near the vehicle from various different points in a city. In such embodiments the in vehicle computing system may notify the driver of possible encounters e.g. intersection points or travel routes of multiple emergency vehicles . Further the notifications may be independent or aggregated e.g. rendered on the same display screen depending on the particular embodiment. As described above it should be appreciated that in some embodiments the alert mechanisms of the in vehicle computing system may be integrated with a mapping service or provide an API to a mapping service of the vehicle in order to provide such alerts and or reporting of the travel routes of emergency vehicles . The method returns to block in which the in vehicle computing system waits to receive further route data from the emergency vehicle e.g. updated travel route data or a different emergency vehicle .
