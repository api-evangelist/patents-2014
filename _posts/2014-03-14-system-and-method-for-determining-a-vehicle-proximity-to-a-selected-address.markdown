This application claims the benefit of priority from provisional patent application Ser. No. 61 789 989 filed on Mar. 15 2013 and is a continuation in part of prior U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 230 507 filed on Sep. 12 2011 which claims the benefit of priority from provisional patent application Ser. No. 61 409 623 filed on Nov. 3 2010 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present disclosure relates to systems for identifying locations of interest. In particular this disclosure relates to systems for issuing alerts and providing information about assets within the locations of interest when users are determined to be nearby the location of interest.

Vehicles and other assets may be repossessed when a borrower is delinquent in payment of a loan or other contractual agreement. In a common scenario if the borrower cannot timely service the loan and is delinquent in payments the creditor may seek to repossess the vehicle or other asset either directly or more commonly through an affiliated repossession company.

The borrower may willingly relinquish possession of the vehicle or asset to the repossession company. In such circumstances the repossession company may take possession of the vehicle or asset at the debtor s residence. In other situations the debtor may not willingly relinquish possession of the vehicle or asset and in the case of vehicles may hide the vehicle or otherwise maintain the vehicle at an undisclosed location away from his or her place of residence. This renders it difficult for the repossession company to locate the vehicle.

Further when a vehicle to be repossessed cannot be easily located agents skip tracers and spotters associated with the repossession company may randomly view the license plates of vehicles in areas known to be frequented by the debtor often based on the description of the vehicle. However this is very expensive inefficient and time consuming because the agent spotter or skip tracer may have a set of documents for each vehicle to be repossessed and must cross reference the documents in his possession with each suspect license plate that he or she views while driving or while a passenger in a spotter vehicle. Additionally using agent spotter or skip tracer is inherently unreliable because it necessarily depends on the agent spotter or skip tracer s ability to locate and accurately identify a vehicle.

A system for determining the proximity of client devices to locations of interest is provided. The system includes a data server configured to receive data identifying a plurality of vehicles and associated vehicle locations and an input processor configured to process the received data to identify a plurality of locations of interest related to one or more assets. A database in operative communication with the data server is provided to store the locations of interest as information records. A notification server is provided to receive data identifying geographic locations of a plurality of client devices. An output processor is operatively coupled to the notification server and is configured to determine whether one or of more the client devices are within a predetermined proximity to one or more of the locations of interest. The output processor is further configured to generate a proximity alert when the one or more client devices are determined to be within the predetermined proximity to one or more of the locations of interest.

In another aspect a non transitory computer readable storage medium is provided having stored therein data representing instructions executable by a programmed processor for determining proximity of communication devices to locations of interest. The storage medium includes instructions operative for receiving data identifying a plurality of assets and geographic locations associated with the assets and processing the received data to identify a plurality of locations of interest related to one or more of the assets. The storage medium includes instructions for storing the locations of interest to a database as an information record including data related to the location of interest and identifying a location of a communication device. The storage medium further includes instructions for determining whether the location of the communication device is within a predetermined proximity to one or more locations of interest and generating a proximity notification when the communication device is within the predetermined proximity to the one or more locations of interest.

In further aspects a computer implemented method using at least one processor for determining proximity of client devices to a location of interest is provided. The method includes receiving data identifying information related to a plurality of assets and a plurality of geographic locations associated with the assets. The received data is processed to identify locations of interest and a proximity area for each of the locations of interest. The location data for a plurality of client devices is monitored and a proximity alert is generated when one or more of the plurality of client devices is determined to be within the proximity area for one or more location of interest

The vehicle tracking and locating system includes a database controller in operative communication with a master database a request server configured to receive a data request from a user or agent an input request processor operatively coupled to the request server and an output processor operatively coupled to the request server and configured to provide data of interest from information records stored in the master database .

A recognition module may be operatively coupled to the request server and to the database controller and may further include a license plate recognition system LPRS or ALPR system automatic license plate recognition an optical character recognition system and a dimensional recognition system A.

Users may communicate with the request server using a variety of remote or external communication devices to transmit a data request to the request server regarding a particular vehicle of interest. The external communication devices may be wireless devices and or wired devices such as cellular telephones smart phones computers mobile devices tablets a GPS navigation device or any suitable communication device . The user may transmit a data request by inputting a vehicle identification number VIN a license plate number a photographic image of a license plate or the vehicle itself or a video containing images of the vehicle and its associated license plate as captured by the communication device or by a digital camera .

Referring to when the request server receives the request from the user the request may be in a variety of different formats using different communication protocols depending upon the type of external communication device that is used and the communication mode in which it is operating. The dataflow may include varied protocols and message formats handled by hardware or software modules or components such as a short message service SMS module a text message module an email message module a multimedia message service MMS module a voicemail VM module a video module or a streaming video module for example. Any suitable component or module may be used to decode format and process the message received. The SMS module may be a SMS server dedicated to receiving and processing SMS communication while the MMS module may be an MMS server dedicated to receiving and processing MMS communication.

Each of the requests or messages from the user is preferably decoded and handled by the input message component or handler directed toward that particular protocol or message format. Further a voice recognition system may be coupled to the voicemail module to convert the voice message into a text message so that the text message can be provided to the request server . The request server may include an authentication component configured to verify and authenticate that the requesting user is authorized to access the vehicle tracking and locating system . A real time log may also be generated and maintained by the request server .

Such input message modules or handlers whether hardware software a combination of hardware or software may be resident within the request server or within another component of the vehicle tracking and locating system or may be separate and independent from the vehicle tracking and locating system .

Alternatively some input message components or handlers services and functions may be provided by a third party or third party component. The short message service SMS service module may be provided by or replaced by an independent third party SMS messaging service and may be external to the vehicle tracking and locating system . The third party SMS messaging service may be provided by an entity referred to as TextMeForBusiness.com. Such third party SMS providers essentially host the SMS transactions and provide the necessary infrastructure to manage and service the SMS transactions such as text to screen formatting auto response message formatting and other features. Such third party providers receive the data request from the external communication devices and decode extract format and forward the user message to the request server .

Similarly a third party MMS multi media service provider may replace the multi media messaging service module in the request server and may be external to the vehicle tracking and locating system . Such third party MMS providers essentially host the MMS transactions and provide the necessary infrastructure to manage and service the MMS transactions such as text to screen formatting auto response message formatting and other features. Such third party providers receive the data request from the external communication devices and decode extract format and forward the user message to the request server . As referred to herein the SMS service module may be used interchangeably with the SMS third party provider service because the end result is essentially similar that is the message is received and processed. Similarly the MMS service module may be used interchangeably with the MMS third party provider service .

As an overview regarding the user process for accessing the vehicle tracking and locating system the following example involves use of the SMS format but is applicable to any embodiment utilizing a different message format. In this example the user may type a plurality of digits such as a multi digit access code into the external communication device such as a cellular telephone smart phone or any other communication device which directs the call to the short message services SMS module or to the SMS third party provider for example. In response the SMS module or the SMS third party service provider requests that the user provide a query assuming that the user is authorized to access the system.

The user or agent may respond by entering plate 333ABCD. This informs the vehicle tracking and locating system that the user is inquiring about a license plate number. Alternatively the user may respond by entering the VIN number. Further the user may respond by attaching a photographic image a video stream or any attachment containing the license plate number for which further information is desired as will be discussed in greater detail below.

The SMS third party service provider decodes and formats the request to the request server which in turn obtains the requested information from the master database via a database lookup. If the requested license plate number is found in the database information about the corresponding vehicle is provided to the user via the SMS third party service provider or in another format as provided via output processor . Such information includes for example data about a possible repossession action or stolen vehicle action the registered owner of the vehicle name of debtor or lien holder lien status vehicle insurance status vehicle year vehicle make vehicle model vehicle color VIN number associated finance company date that vehicle entered a repossession list or a stolen vehicle list case number location status address and or GPS coordinates law enforcement status stolen owner APB predator in a restricted area etc. and the like. Also when a match is found the system may transmit an electronic copy of the documents corresponding to the vehicle of interest.

Referring to one embodiment of the database controller is illustrated. The database controller includes a client data processor a search engine and a video and image input processor operatively coupled to the master database . The client data processor may receive input from a client data feed system while the video and image input processor may receive input from a video image feed system the license plate recognition system and an optical character recognition system .

The master database may be updated based on input from the client data feed system which includes multiple clients . Such clients may represent the various credit companies banking entities finance credit companies vehicle credit agencies and law enforcement agencies which may have agreements in place with owner of the vehicle tracking and locating system . Such clients or third party entities provide data to the master database through the database controller based on vehicles that are subject to repossession for nonpayment of loans with respect to banking and credit agencies while law enforcement may provide additional data with respect to stolen vehicles. Alternatively the database controller may access remote databases through an external database request interface or communication link . The database controller may request information from external databases such as municipal vehicle databases and the National Crime Information Center NCIC database which maintains a record of all vehicles reported stolen in the United States and other municipal state and Federal databases.

The client data feed system facilitates data transfer from the clients including documents and messages. The data may be in the form of CSV files comma separated value PDF documents or may be any suitable data format. The database controller may create update and or delete information records in the master database based on the information received from the clients . The documents and data may be transmitted using standard file transfer protocol such as FTP for example.

In one specific embodiment the master database may be segmented or divided into separate logical data areas corresponding to the specific client source. For example a first client may be TRW Credit Corp. while a second client may be GE Credit Corp. The master database may be segmented for security and privacy considerations because if a vehicle is subject to repossession with respect to a first client only repossession agencies authorized by that first client are permitted to access the corresponding information and engage in action related to the repossession of the subject vehicle.

In some embodiments a user may be denied information about a vehicle subject to repossession if that user is not authorized by the client . Thus in one embodiment such a user may not even be informed by the vehicle tracking and locating system that a requested vehicle license plates corresponds to a vehicle subject repossession if that user is not authorized by the client to receive such information. Accordingly even if a particular vehicle is subject to a repossession order if the user inquiring about that that license plate number is not a member of one of the repossession companies authorized to handle repossession of that car that user may not receive an affirmative indication that the vehicle is subject to repossession. Alternatively the user may be given an indication that the vehicle is subject to repossession but that the requesting user is not authorized to go forward with the associated repossession.

In other embodiments rather than logically or physically segmenting the master database the information records may instead be tagged or associated with the corresponding client . The search engine may inspect the associated client identifier and provide requested information only if there is a match between the information record associated with the client and the authorization status of the user requesting the information.

The database controller may provide access to the master database on a multi tier basis. For example authentication and access may be provided based on three access levels such as a master administrator level a manager level and a user level each with different privileges and access rights.

Master administrator rights are typically granted to selected employees of the company that own and control the master database . The master administrator determines which users and managers are able to obtain data regarding vehicle subject repossession based upon arrangements between clients and the third party repossession companies.

The master administrator is responsible for accepting or pre authorizing dial in telephone numbers authorized IP addresses or other external communication device identifiers corresponding to the various users. The master administrator can create delete and manage the user level and the manager level accounts. Further the master administrator may set a particular maximum number of users and managers in the vehicle tracking and locating system .

The master administrator may also access the real time log that is maintained by the vehicle tracking and locating system . The real time log may record all of the queries requested by the users and all the responses provided to the users. The report may indicate the frequency of successful license plate number matches and statistics surrounding the matching process such as the number of matches per 100 queries and the like. Such statistics may also include geographical data so that the success rate for matches can be correlated with various geographical locations.

The manager level entity is typically a member of an external repossession company which may employ for example ten users agents or drivers. A technician at the external repossession company may be considered to be a manager and such a manager is typically able to provide authorization to the various users or drivers under authorization from the master administrator.

The video and image input processor of the database controller receives video and image data from the video image feed system . The video image feed system is shown in greater detail in . The video image feed system provides a real time data stream of license plate data for storage in the master database .

The video data and image data may be received from a plurality of sources such as from municipal cameras highway toll collection cameras traffic cameras security cameras spotter vehicle cameras law enforcement cameras crowd source external devices and other video image capture devices which may correspond to mobile image capture devices or fixed image capture devices. Spotter vehicle cameras are typically mounted on spotter cars and or tow trucks which may continuously capture images of vehicles and their license plates as the spotter vehicles drive along streets travel through parking lots and along other access routes.

Once the images of the vehicles and their license plates are captured by whatever means available automatic license plate recognition processing may be applied to the images to isolate extract and identify the license plate number prior to storage in the master database along with the time and date that the image was captured and including the geographical location or coordinates of the image capture. To facilitate this process the license plate recognition system ALPR and the OCR system may be operatively coupled to the video and image input processor .

The automatic license plate recognition system ALPR may be a commercially available recognition system embodied either in hardware components and or software components. For example the license plate recognition system may be commercially available from PIPS Technology a Federal Signal Company of Knoxville Tenn. Software processing modules to facilitate ALPR may also be commercially available from Inex Zamir of Knoxville Tenn. under the name of Insignia software.

In one embodiment the video images are transmitted with an indication of a time and date that the image was captured in addition to the geographic location where the image was captured. The geographic location may be provided by an associated GPS system coupled to the image capture device. Alternatively for fixed image capture devices a known geographical location of the fixed camera may be transmitted or an identifying number of the fixed camera may be transmitted so that the vehicle tracking and locating system can assign a predetermined geographical location to the fixed image capture device.

As described above the user may transmit a data request to the request server by inputting a vehicle identification number VIN or a license plate number. Using the external communication device such as a digital camera the user may also capture an image of the license plate number and transmit a photographic image of a license plate number to the request server . A video stream may also be captured. The input request processor may transmit the image or the video stream to the video and image input processor of the database controller which in turn may utilize the license plate recognition system and or the OCR system to convert the photographic image into a license plate number suitable for storage in the master database .

As described above the user may direct an MMS message to either the multimedia messaging service module or to the MMS third party service provider . The MMS data format is more complex than a text message because the information requested is usually embedded in an image or series of images video stream and must be extracted using some form of recognition processing such as the license plate recognition system and or the optical character recognition system . Once the MMS message has been received by the MMS service module each image or each frame of the video stream is analyzed to locate and isolate the portion of the image that contains the license plate image.

The OCR recognition system may be used to determine the particular portion of the image that contains characters such as the license plate. The OCR recognition system may crop and discard the portion of the image that is determined not to contain text data. The OCR recognition system may be a color OCR system or an infrared OCR system. Alternatively if the image as originally captured has a tight focus meaning that the image captured only includes the image of the license plate the image may be transmitted directly to the license plate recognition system without preprocessing by the OCR recognition system to isolate the license plate.

In another embodiment the OCR recognition system may be incorporated into the ALPR system . The ALPR system may then analyze the image of the license plate to convert the image to alphanumeric characters representing the license plate number.

The following is an example of an agent or a spotter using a mobile device such as a smart phone to transmit MMS data to the vehicle tracking and locating system . The agent or user may walk through parking garage or public area or may be a passenger in a moving vehicle and may point the hand held mobile device external communication device toward parked or moving vehicles to capture images of the license plates.

The smart phone may be recording and saving the video stream in memory or may be streaming the video in real time through a cellular connection to the MMS third party service provider or the MMS service module . In this way each image or sequence of images is processed by the vehicle tracking and locating system to isolate the plurality of license plate numbers captured.

Each license plate number captured is forwarded to the database controller to perform a data match and or save the data if it does not exist in the database . Preferably all license plate numbers are saved in the master database along with the time that the image was captured and the location of capture based upon the GPS tag associated with the data transmission.

In one embodiment to reduce the storage requirements of the database certain license plate numbers may be deleted if they are stale meaning that the associated timestamp is very old. Whether the external communication device is streaming the video in real time or whether it is transmitting the recorded video or still frame image at a later time from memory the MMS module analyzes the images on a frame by frame basis.

Turning back to the request server may provide the authentication component which includes login control and verification. In one embodiment the user is not required to affirmatively log in. Rather using caller ID IP address confirmation or a similar process the authentication component may recognize the phone number or internet address of the caller or other identification of the external communication device which has been preauthorized for acceptance by the authentication component . Each telephone or other communication device is preferably authorized in advance for acceptance by the authorization component .

Alternatively the authorization component need be not be resident in the request server or in the vehicle tracking and locating system and may be provided by a third party component or service such as the SMS third party service provided or the MMS third party service provider discussed above. Any third party provider may assist in authenticating the user.

In another embodiment when the user places a call to the request server the request server transmits a display interface or GUI to the user and the user may then provide a security code or other password to gain access to vehicle tracking and locating system . Of course the third party component or service such as the SMS or MMS third party service provider may also transmit the display interface or GUI to the user.

Once the user has transmitted a request to the request server and and has been properly authenticated the search engine determines if the requested license plate number is found in the database subject to the above described criteria for permitting the user to obtain access to information. If a match is found the output processor organizes and transmits the data of interest to the user in one of a variety of possible formats depending upon the format in which the request was received.

The data of interest may be transmitted as text a synthesized voice message based on text and may also be transmitted in the form of documents such as in PDF format JPG format or document text format or in other suitable electronic format. The data of interest may include information about the vehicle including vehicle year vehicle make vehicle color vehicle model vehicle owner lien holder vehicle identification number vehicle location history case number date of repossession action reporting agency credit agency date stolen if applicable and the like.

As shown in each external communication device may include a resident application or App which is a specific plug in or software module installed on the external communication device to facilitate the above communication process. Preferably the application is installed on a smart phone tablet or other device having an operating system used by a large number of people. For example mobile devices using the Google s Android operating system or Apple s iOS operating system may implement the application .

The application increases the efficiency and flexibility of the system minimizes use of customized hardware and software to reduce cost and increases user or agent convenience satisfaction and efficiency. Such an application may replace customized software modules and provides a uniform interface to the user or agent. Further because most external communication devices such as smart phones are GPS enabled images and video captured by such devices can be tagged with the GPS coordinates so that the location of the image vehicle captured is associated with its corresponding location.

Such applications may be used by the agent or by the members of the general population that receive compensation to provide video or images to the vehicle tracking and location system . This is referred to as crowd sourcing that is employing the masses or general population as spotters to participate in providing data to the vehicle tracking and locating system . For example students may be paid a commensurate amount to record and or stream video images of the areas in which they travel using external communication devices they own.

Such video may be recorded for subsequent transmission or may be transmitted in real time to the vehicle tracking and locating system . The student need only download the application to his or her mobile device and activate the application to permit the device to record any and all images. In one embodiment the participating students or spotters may be paid a stipend depending upon the volume of recorded information. In another embodiment to encourage higher quality information the students may be paid a percentage of fees received if the information provided by the student is used in an actual repossession or identification of a vehicle in question.

Embodiments of the vehicle tracking and locating system are not limited to finding only vehicles of interest such as vehicles subject to repossession. The vehicle tracking and locating system may also find application in parking enforcement. For example a parking enforcement officer or agent may have an external communication device such as a smart phone for which the above described application is installed.

The officer or agent may travel past many parked vehicles while the smart phone streams video data or still photographs to the vehicle tracking and locating system preferably in MMS format. Based upon a recorded images of the plurality of license plates the vehicle tracking and locating system may isolate recognize and identify each license plate number and compare the license plate numbers to the municipal vehicle database operated by a municipality or other government body. The municipal vehicle database may contain records corresponding to vehicles having outstanding parking or other violations. The vehicle tracking and locating system may also request data from the National Crime Information Center NCIC database .

Based on a match between the license plate number recognized and the license plate number contained in the database the output processor may provide an output to a parking meter enforcement agent that confirms that a vehicle scanned has outstanding tickets and thus should be impounded or booted with a Denver Boot or similar immobilization device. The parking officer or agent may receive a graphic output or notification directly on the smart phone or display device. Alternatively the smart phone may be coupled to a wireless or wired printer so that a hardcopy can be printed. If the officer or agent has printing capability a further citation maybe printed and issued and a affixed to the vehicle in lieu of impoundment.

In another embodiment the automatic license plate recognition system ALPR may be used in conjunction with the dimensional recognition or object recognition system A so that the dimensions or general shape of the vehicle may be identified and quantified. In this way a license plate number recognized can be compared to the municipal vehicle database to verify that the license plate indeed belongs to that specific type of vehicle to which it is affixed. For example once the license plate number has been recognized the make and model of the vehicle may be obtained from the official vehicle registration database .

A vehicle dimension database may be part of or may be included in the master database or may be separate therefrom. The vehicle dimension database may include information as to the overall dimensions of every make and model of vehicle. In operation when the license plate recognition system ALPR extracts the license plate number of a particular vehicle it may instruct the database controller to request the make and model of that vehicle from the municipal vehicle database or other database containing official vehicle registration information if such information is not already of record in the master database . Of course the request for information from the municipal vehicle database need not necessarily be made by the database controller but rather may be made by the request server or other component of the vehicle tracking and locating system .

In one embodiment for example if the municipal vehicle database indicates that the vehicle scanned is a Volkswagen but the vehicle dimension database indicates that the size of the vehicle corresponding to the license plate number is much larger than a Volkswagen an alert can be issued indicating that the license plate may be stolen and is affixed to the wrong vehicle. The system may also use additional vehicle information retrieved from the dimension database and municipal vehicle database as well other public databases containing official vehicle information to assist in identifying license plates that are affixed to the wrong vehicle. For example the system may retrieve vehicle information relating to color size make model series or any other identifying information and may use this information to identify license plates located on incorrect vehicles. The system may provide for automatic recognition and comparison of vehicle features or may place potential matches in a queue for a system administrator to review and verify. In either scenario the system can store the information identifying mismatched license plates as CPIC correct plate incorrect car leads.

In another embodiment the vehicle tracking and locating system may provide a proximity alert for fleet and dispatch management. A proximity alert may generally be used in identifying locations of interest as further described in connection with . However a proximity alert may also be used to provide efficiencies in fleet and dispatch management by identifying client devices that are within predefined proximity to a location of interest which may be for example an address where a vehicle is frequently spotted. In this embodiment the identity of vehicles of interest whether subject to repossession or of interest for any reason such as for marketing purposes are downloaded or imported into a GPS navigation device or map enabled smart phone installed in the agent s or spotter s vehicle. Of course the GPS navigation device smart phone or other suitable device must have a sufficiently large memory to accommodate all of the data. The GPS navigation device may be a commercially available navigation device such as those provided by Garmin Corporation.

The GPS navigation device may then compare the current location of the agent s vehicle in a real time against the location of all of the downloaded data corresponding to various vehicles or other locations of interest. The GPS navigation device may then compare the location of each vehicle of interest in memory to the current location of the agent s vehicle to determine the distance from the agent s vehicle to the stored location data for the vehicle of interest assuming the time stamp associated with the vehicle of interest is not stale. 

If the GPS navigation device determines that the vehicle of interest is within a predetermined radius of the agent s vehicle for example within one mile and the time stamp was relatively recent for example within five minutes the GPS navigation device may alert the agent and direct the agent to the last known location of the vehicle of interest.

In that way the agent could attempt to locate and track the vehicle of interest and take appropriate action. Of course the predetermined radius and the time stamp differential i.e. the current time minus the timestamp associated with the vehicle of interest may be increased or decreased depending upon the application and the scope of the agent s work. Also to keep the data fresh or up to date the information corresponding to the vehicles of interest are preferably downloaded to the GPS navigation device periodically such as every 5 minutes for example.

Alternatively the data corresponding to the vehicles of interest need not be downloaded and remain resident in the GPS navigation device. Rather the GPS navigation device may communicate in real time with the vehicle tracking and location system and may transmit the current location or coordinates of the agent s vehicle to the vehicle tracking and location system for example every 30 seconds. The vehicle tracking and location system may then compare the location of the agent s vehicle to all of the vehicles of interest in the database based upon the location of the vehicle of interest and the time that the vehicle of interest was spotted.

If the vehicle of interest was spotted within a predetermined radius of the current location of the agent vehicle and if the time that the vehicle of interest was spotted was relatively recent i.e. within the last 10 minutes for example the vehicle tracking and location system may inform the agent through the GPS navigation device or other alert methods that may be handled for example by output processor including email text message or similar alert that a vehicle of interest was spotted and may be close by. The GPS navigation device may also provide navigational directions to the agent to facilitate pursuit of the vehicle interest at least with respect to its last known location.

Note that the vehicle tracking and location system may provide navigational directions to the agent or spotter should the agent not be in possession of a GPS navigational device. Based on the coordinates of a destination reverse geo coding can be applied to either the vehicle interest or the agent vehicle. Reverse geo encoding means that once the GPS coordinates of a destination are known a map or navigational directions or an address can be transmitted to the agent s smart phone or other device. In one embodiment a commercially available reverse geo coding system such as Google Maps Microsoft Bing On Line Microsoft MapPoint Streets Trips or MapQuest may be used.

The vehicle tracking and locating system may be embodied as a system cooperating with computer hardware components and or as computer implemented methods. The vehicle tracking and locating system may include a plurality of software modules or subsystems. The components modules or subsystems such as the request server the input request processor the output processor the database controller the video and image input processor the client data processor the search engine the license plate recognition system the optical character recognition system and other components and or modules of the vehicle tracking locating system may be implemented in hardware software firmware or any combination of hardware software and firmware.

Such components modules or subsystems may or may not reside within a single physical or logical space. For example the components modules or subsystems referred to in this document and which may or may not be shown in the drawings may be remotely located from each other and may be coupled by a communication network.

The computer may be a personal computer and may include various hardware components such as RAM ROM hard disk storage cache memory database storage and the like also referred to as memory subsystem . The computer may include any suitable processing device such as a computer microprocessor RISC processor reduced instruction set computer CISC processor complex instruction set computer mainframe computer work station single chip computer distributed processor server controller micro controller discrete logic computer and the like as is known in the art. For example the processing device may be an Intel Pentium microprocessor x86 compatible microprocessor or equivalent device and may be incorporated into a server a personal computer or any suitable computing platform.

The memory subsystem may include any suitable storage components such as RAM EPROM electrically programmable ROM flash memory dynamic memory static memory FIFO first in first out memory LIFO last in first out memory circular memory semiconductor memory bubble memory buffer memory disk memory optical memory cache memory and the like. Any suitable form of memory may be used whether fixed storage on a magnetic medium storage in a semiconductor device or remote storage accessible through a communication link. A user or system interface may be coupled to the computer system and may include various input devices such as switches selectable by the system manager and or a keyboard. The user interface also may include suitable output devices such as an LCD display a CRT various LED indicators a printer and or a speech output device as is known in the art.

To facilitate communication between the computer and external sources or other components modules and subsystems a communication interface may be operatively coupled to the computer system . The communication interface may be for example a local area network such as an Ethernet network intranet Internet or other suitable network . The communication interface may also be connected to a public switched telephone network PSTN or POTS plain old telephone system which may facilitate communication via the Internet . Any suitable commercially available communication device or network may be used.

If the user is authorized to access the vehicle tracking and locating system the user then initiates a request to the request server or third party provider service . If the user is not authorized an output message is prepared indicating that the user is not authorized processing then branches to a component that outputs the prepared message and the routine exits. The component that prepares and or sends the output message in some embodiments may be the output processor .

The user may provide the request in a variety of formats such as a voice request an image request or a text request . If the request is not in any of the required formats an output message is prepared indicating an input request error which requests that the user try again .

If the request is a voice request voice recognition is applied to identify the text of the request which corresponds to a license plate number. If the request is an image request where the user is transmitting a digital image of a license plate automatic license plate recognition is applied to identify the license plate number in the request . If the request is an video request or streaming video request the OCR system isolates the portions of the images frames containing the license plate and forwards the cropped portions to the license plate recognition system so as to identify the license plate number in the request . If the request is a text message license plate number in the message is extracted .

Once the license plate number of interest is been extracted and identified the search engine searches the master database to determine if a match exists . In one embodiment if the request contains video or photographic images and if no match is found the license plate number and associated information such as location and time are saved in the database so as to continuously build the database and an output message is prepared indicating that no match has been found . Processing then branches to the component that outputs the prepared message and the routine exits.

In one embodiment if the request contains video or photographic images and if a match is found in the master database the master database is updated with respect to the location and time . Next the matching record is inspected to determine if the user is authorized to view the matching information and or engage in actions relative to the repossession of the vehicle for which a match is found . If the user is not authorized an output message is prepared indicating that the user is not authorized and that the request is denied . Processing then branches to the component that outputs the prepared message .

If the user is authorized to view the matching information and or engage in actions relative to the repossession of the vehicle for which a match is found the information of interest is obtained from the matching database record and an output message is prepared indicating that the information is available. The output message is then sent to the user along with the information of interest obtained from the database and the routine exits.

In addition to the aforementioned uses of the methods and systems the present disclosure describes a system that may be utilized to provide proximity alerts when various client devices are within predefined distances from locations of interests. The client devices may include various devices in use by agents or spotters associated with the system or by third party institutions that have agreements with the system administrator. The devices used by the agents spotters and contractors may include various ALPR systems that gather and transmit data to the central servers of the system. ALPR systems may also be used by repossession companies state municipalities federal state and local governments skip tracers and may be stationary recognition devices e.g. street cameras or mobile recognition devices e.g. vehicle mounted cameras . As previously discussed these ALPR systems may randomly view the license plates of vehicles.

In addition to providing data regarding randomly viewed license plates these ALPR systems as well as other client devices associated with agents spotters and third party contractors may transmit the current location of the client device to the system server. The server may determine a location of interest based on aggregated historical data. For example in one embodiment the location of interest may be a location of a vehicle subject to repossession and may be determined based on historical license plate recognition LPR data for that vehicle. However the location of interest need not be associated directly with a vehicle but rather may be associated with numerous benchmarks as required by a particular system implementation. For example in other embodiments the location of interest may be associated with the identity of an individual or with another asset. A location of interest may also be determined using one or more patterns of behaviors or inferences drawn from the historical data for the asset such as frequently visited residential or commercial locations frequently driven routes and the like.

Data server stores the LPR data received from ALPR systems . Data server may consist of a single data server and database or may be multiple distributed data servers and databases in operative communication over a network such as the Internet. In certain embodiments data servers may be implemented in conjunction with manufacturer specific tools or third party server management tools. Example tools that data servers may make use of include tools provided by 3M Back Office System Software or home based server software provided by ELSAG and the like. Data server may also receive or access data from third party sources and manufacturers. For example data server may be in operative communication with municipal vehicle databases NCIS databases or receive data from client data feed systems as well as from other third party entities. Data server can be a cache server that aggregates and stores all LPR data from the various sources in a format that may be accessed by data extraction tools such as MVET Motor Vehicle Extraction and Transmission tool .

In some embodiments data aggregation environment may include one or more MVET tools . MVET tool is a data extraction and transmission tool that can be designed to overlay various components of data server and may be integrated with any of the aforementioned manufacturer specific or third party server management tools. MVET may be coupled to one or more processors servers and databases to perform the particular data extraction and data processing functionality to be implemented by the MVET tool. Data aggregation environment may include multiple instances of MVET tool each of which may be designed to overlay a subset of components from data servers . Regardless of the implementation of data server MVET tool is designed to access and extract data from data servers .

MVET tool extracts LPR data from the data server . For example MVET tool may be designed to extract vehicle tracking information including license plate images and license plate text. The LPR data may be processed by video and image input processor which is operatively coupled to ALPR system and the OCR system as described in connection with . MVET tool may then divide and separate the images and text data. The system may use recognition software to identify additional text from the retrieved images. The image data can be transmitted to image warehouse and the text data can be transmitted to text data warehouse . Image warehouse and text data warehouse may likewise consist of one of more servers and databases. Image warehouse and text data warehouse may be the same data warehouse or each may consist of multiple distributed data servers and databases in operative communication over a network. An exemplary image data warehouse may include web based services such as Amazon S3 . An exemplary text data warehouse may include one or more relationship databases such as Amazon RDS . Image data warehouse and text data warehouse may be cloud computing platforms or may consist of similar offline storage platforms.

Data aggregation environment may also include RMP recover management pro server . RMP server may be the same server as data server or they may be one or more distributed servers in operative communication over a network such as the Internet. RMP server is a web accessible tool that may be in operative communication with image data warehouse text data warehouse MVET and data servers . In some embodiments RMP server may also be in operative communication with MVNote a system component responsible for generating alerts and notifications to be sent to various user devices. RMP server may implement one or more web based user interfaces . Web based user interfaces may be secure portals that allow a system user to access LPR data such as the data stored in image data warehouse and text data warehouse and return results specific to that user s needs.

RMP server allows the system to display to a user the results of processing historical LPR data relating to one or more vehicles of interest. In this way RMP server provides a user interface that can be implemented in various configurations in order to provide a system user with an interface for displaying historical LPR data in a way that suits that particular user s need or business goals. For example in the instance of a user wishing to locate a particular vehicle for repossession RMP server may provide a mapping feature that displays historical vehicle views as flags or hits within a geographic area. The user interface may also include one or more classifications describing an aspect of the vehicle views such as the recency of the hit time of day frequency or whether the vehicle was spotted having mismatched license plate data. In some embodiments RMP server may also generate a hotlist of vehicles of interest as well as hotlists of locations of interest. The hotlist is transmitted back to data servers and downloaded or pushed to ALPR systems . In this way ALPR systems can receive up to date information for identifying vehicles of interest during use.

The hotlist may also be used by MVNote to alert ALPR systems or other agent devices of their proximity to vehicles or other locations of interest. MVNote includes an automated data processing and notification system that can be designed to overlay and interact with the various system components. MVNote may include one or more processors and servers located on the same machine or that are in in operative communication over a network such as over the Internet. In some embodiments MVNote may include output processor or may utilize request server to communicate with a variety of remote devices such as external communication devices . MVNote may also be in operative communication over a network with one or more third party institutions and one or more client devices .

Client devices may include wireless devices and or wired devices such as cellular telephones smart phones computers mobile devices tablets a GPS navigation device on board vehicle computers with telecommunication capability or any suitable communication device capable of transmitting a GPS signal and or receiving system notifications. Client devices may be the same devices as external communication devices or may include additional devices capable of communicating their location to the system and receiving proximity alerts. For example client devices may include telecommunication devices that are components of one or more vehicle busses or electronic control units such as an entertainment bus and that form components of a vehicle s on board computer systems. Client devices may communicate with the system and third party institutions over a wireless network.

In some embodiments a wireless network may include a system of terminals gateways routers or the like coupled by wireless radio links or the like which may move freely randomly or organize themselves arbitrarily such that network topology may change at times even rapidly. A wireless network may further employ a plurality of network access technologies including Long Term Evolution LTE WLAN Wireless Router WR mesh or 2nd 3rd or 4th generation 2G 3G or 4G cellular technology or the like. Network access technologies may enable wide area coverage for devices such as client devices with varying degrees of mobility for example.

For example a network may enable radio frequency RF or wireless type communication via one or more network access technologies such as Global System for Mobile communication GSM Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS General Packet Radio Services GPRS Enhanced Data GSM Environment EDGE 3GPP Long Term Evolution LTE LTE Advanced Wideband Code Division Multiple Access WCDMA Bluetooth 802.11b g n or the like. A wireless network may include virtually any type of wireless communication mechanism by which signals may be communicated between devices such as a client device or a computing device between or within a network or the like.

Third party institutions may include any business that has a contractual relationship or is otherwise associated with the system. Example third party institutions include not only institutions having various interests in vehicles such as repossession companies vehicle recovery and salvage companies creditor institutions and the like but also any institution that may be receive a benefit from the proximity alerts generated by the tracking and location system for identifying locations of interest. Such institutions may include creditors parking management services or other municipalities tracking neighborhood parking compliance process servers interested in tracking the location of an individual in order to complete service law enforcement agencies and so forth. It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that these uses are merely exemplary and that the system may be utilized to identify locations of interests and provide proximity alerts in way that may be relevant to the needs of a particular user within the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.

The system processes the stored location indices to identify locations of interest and to generate hotlists of identified locations. The method for determining which location of interest may be relevant to a particular user can be adapted to take into account the various parameters that may be relevant to that user s business goals. Depending on the business goals of the system user the system may use various methods of algorithmic analysis to identify locations of interests that meet certain eligibility criteria for the particular use case. Thus depending on the business goals of the particular system user hotlist entries will be generated by considering only the elements of the location index that are relevant to a particular context or use case. The hotlist entries may be stored individually as a separate hotlist corresponding to each user or may be stored as part of a collective data structure where entries are associated with one or more groups of users sharing an interest in the particular location. In either scenario the system may continually monitor LPR data and geo location data being generated by the ALPR devices in order to update the hotlists by adding or removing locations of interest as the new information is received.

Once the hotlists are generated the system proceeds to monitor geo location data for the various agent devices associated with the system. The system receives periodic transmissions containing geo location data from the GPS enabled devices of agents and other telecommunication devices in communication with the system servers . Agents of the system may include users having a contractual or business relationship with the system administrator skip tracers spotters and the like. These agents may be traveling on foot or in a vehicle and may be continuously transmitting their location from a GPS enabled device or other telecommunication device as the agent travels along streets sidewalks through parking lots and along other access routes. The telecommunication and GPS enabled devices which may be the same devices as client devices or external communication devices are in operative communication with one or more servers associated with the system. The GPS enabled devices may communicate with the servers asynchronously or in real time. In some embodiments the GPS enabled devices may be in operative communication with one or more of request server data server or RMP server .

The GPS data of the agent devices is received by the system servers and the location of the device is determined . Although reference is made is to GPS enabled devices it should be noted that in some embodiments other methods of determining a telecommunication device s location from transmitted data may be used including but not limited to triangulation multilateration of radio signals or location based services that disclose actual coordinates or other geo location data of a communication device. In any event once the geo location data is received by the server the server can retrieve historical LPR data and one or more hotlists generated by the system that may be associated with the geo location data. The hotlists may be stored as logical data structures in one or more relational databases associated with the systems servers such as master database and those in operative communication with MVNote . As previously mentioned the hotlists may be individually associated with one or more systems users or may be composite hotlists having locations of interest for all users or a sub group of related system users. For example in order to improve efficiency in data retrieval and processing the hotlists may be separated by particular use cases such as law enforcement agencies or parking management companies and each may include notification information for all users having business goals falling within the particular category or use case. In this case the system need only retrieve and process the hotlists for a particular category or use case in order to identify all notifications should be generated.

In any event once the relevant hotlists have been retrieved the system identifies all of the locations of interest in the hotlist . The system may identify each location of interest in an iterative process or may simultaneously identify and monitor locations of interest using one or more parallel processors. For each location of interest in the hotlist the system then compares the device s location data with that of the location of interest and determines whether the device falls within a given proximity to the location of interest . In some embodiments a predetermined radius may be associated with each location of interest and used to determine whether a device is in proximity to the location of interest. The system may also consider a time stamp associated with the data used to generate the location of interest in order to ensure that the data is not outdated or stale. If the system determines that the device is within a given proximity of the location of interest for example within three miles and the time stamp was relatively recent for example within six hours the system may generate a proximity alert .

In some embodiments the hotlist may be downloaded and stored to the GPS enable device. The GPS enabled device may then compare the current location of the device in a real time environment against the location of all of the downloaded data corresponding to various locations of interest. The GPS enabled device may then compare the coordinates of the device to each location of interest to determine the distance of the location from the GPS enabled device. A proximity alert can be generated and displayed on the screen of the device when the device is determined to be within the given proximity of the location of interest.

In either embodiment the proximity alert may be generated in the form of a notification or alert that is transmitted to an interested party . The interested party may be the GPS enabled device or other telecommunication used by an agent such as the device of the agent that transmitted the location in step or may be a third party institution as described in connection with . The alert may be generated by one or more of the system components previously described in connection with . For example in some embodiments the alert may generated by output processor and sent to request server to be communicated to one or more external communication devices . The alert may be generated in a variety of formats as may be appropriate for the particular communication device. Such formats may include short message service SMS text messages multimedia messaging service MMS text messages emails video messages cellular calls voicemails VM or pop up notifications displayed on the screen or user interface of the device. Depending on the particular application the system may make use of the functionality supported by one or more of SMS module text message module email message module MMS module VM module video module or streaming video module to generate the alerts to be sent out by output processor .

The content and format of the proximity alert will necessarily depend on the requirements of the particular use case. However regardless of the context the alert may generally contain the actionable steps to be transmitted to the interested party . The actionable steps provide the interested party with the information needed to respond to and act on the data associated with the location of interest. The proximity alert may retrieve various components of the location index as needed in order to generate the proximity alert and may include further processing of such index components to provide information for the actionable steps. For example in the case of a repossessor the repossessor s device may produce an alarm and display information related to the alert. The displayed alert may use street address information from the location index and current location of the GPS enabled device in order to generate navigational directions for assisting the agent in navigating to the location of interest at least with respect to the last known location data for the particular location of interest. Similarly in the case of a third party institution being a creditor with an asset near an agent the system may generate an alert notifying the creditor that an agent is within the proximity of an asset and available to secure recovery of the asset for a fee.

The system may use the geo spatial data associated with the location of interest to automatically determine which agent should be assigned for recovery of the asset. For example whenever an alert is to be generated the system may aggregate the data for not only the location of interest and the various field agents but also for any locations related to the anticipated recovery process such as the repossessor s office location storage facility or its preferred agent. The system can then compare these locations and the geo spatial data for the location of interest to all of the locations of the system agents in order to assign the recovery to the most efficient agent able to secure the asset. This allows the system to increase efficiency and reduce overhead by removing the need for dispatch services that are often costly and subject to human error. Additionally in the event that an agent is unable to confirm that they are available to recover the asset the system can quickly and efficiently send a second proximity alert to the next best agent in the system.

After transmitting the proximity alert and actionable steps to the interested party the system will then examine any additional locations of interest in the hotlist . Similarly if the original device was not determined to be in proximity to the location of the interest then no alert would have been generated and the system would then examine any additional locations of interest in the hotlist. If there are additional locations of the interest to be examined the system returns to step in order to examiner the device s proximity to the location of interest. If there no additional locations of interest to examine the process may end for the particular device until further location data is received .

Referring now to a geographical diagram of an exemplary environment for determining a proximity to a selected address is illustrated. Exemplary locations of interest are depicted as vehicles of interest and address of interest . Each of the locations of interest has proximity boundaries associated with the locations respectively. As described in connection with when an agent device such as a GPS enabled devices or other telecommunication devices is determined to be with the proximity of any of the locations of interest the system will generate a proximity alert for the particular location of interest. Depending on the particular use case scenario the system may send the alert to agent devices notifying the agents that they are currently located near a location of interest. For example the system may determine that agent device is with a predetermined radius of vehicle of interest . The system may then transmit the location of the vehicle to the agent using a proximity alert as well any directions or additional information needed for the agent to act on the repossession or restriction of the mobility of the vehicle. For example the system may provide the agent with navigational directions to the vehicle as well as a description of the vehicle. The system may then request that the agent confirm that the vehicle is present and available for recovery.

Alternatively or in addition to the agent alert the system may also transmit a proximity alert to third party institution which may be a creditor of the vehicle of interest . The proximity alert may provide the creditor with information related to the target vehicle or asset. The proximity alert may provide the third party institution with all the information needed to locate the vehicle or may also include details regarding potential agents that are located in the area that are able to recover the asset. If the third party institution agrees to have the agent repossess the vehicle the system may transmit a similar proximity alert to the agent device informing the agent that they have been authorized to repossess the vehicle. The proximity alert may include additional information such as the location of the nearest storage garage where the repossessed vehicle may be towed and stored. The storage garage may be a general storage facility or may be determined based on the preference of the particular third party institution . It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that the described applications of the location index to generate proximity alerts are merely exemplary and that many more embodiments and implementations are envisioned within the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.

As non limiting examples the system can be used to notify creditors or financial institutions with a security interest in any asset that an agent is located near an asset. This may allow the institution to transmit instructions to have the agent recover the asset. The agent may be an independent repossession contractor or may be an employee of a third party financial institution that has an agreement with the system administrator to have the system provide proximity alerts for its employee s devices. The system may also provide alerts directly to the agent device notifying the agent that they are in proximity to the location of interest and in order to have the agent verify that the asset is indeed at the location. The proximity alert may allow the agent to confirm that the asset is or is not present at the location and this information can be sent back to the parties having an interest in the asset. The interested parties could include for example creditors financial institutions repossessors vehicle salvage companies or parking enforcement agencies.

The system may also be adapted to be used with process servers or other parties attempting to locate an individual or asset such as law enforcement agencies. In this scenario the system may generate locations that are related to the historical LPR data associated with the individual or their patterns of behavior. These locations may be stored in a location index as described in connection with . For example the system may identify and store locations where the individual s vehicle has been frequently spotted by ALPR devices. The locations could include street addresses residential addresses commercial addresses frequently traveled access routes and the like. In this way the system can notify the process server or other party attempting to locate the individual that they are within a given proximity to a location where the individual is likely to be present. The proximity alert may provide directions to the location of interest and may also include any relevant data stored for the individual or asset. For example the proximity alert could notify the process server or law enforcement agency that the individual has a violent criminal history and that discretion is advised. This additional information may be retrieved from any public database or any private database that the system has been granted access to. All of the information related to the individual and the location of interest can be stored in the location index for the particular location of interest.

Referring now to an exemplary illustration of location index that may be generated according to one embodiment is depicted. Location index may be generated from the historical LPR data and other data retrieved from one or more public or private databases. Location index may be stored as a logical data structure in a relational database such as master database . Location index may store all forms of data that can be generated from historical LPR data as well as data received from external databases such as municipal vehicle databases and the NCIC database . All of the data may be stored by using one or more location identifying factors as a key if possible. Alternatively the data for each location may be organized by one or more other identifying factors until a location for the data can be inferred or otherwise determined by the system. The identifying factors for each location may include address or GPS coordinates of the location of interest and identifying information for each hit such as the time the asset was spotted device ID of the ALPR device or other telecommunication device or geo location data generated by the ALPR device when it transmitted the LPR data to the system. In the case of vehicles location index may include VIN license plate data vehicle make vehicle model registration address or other identifying information associated with a target . Additionally the system may process the historical LPR data in order to identify one or more patterns of behavior of the target. Each of behaviors for the target may be associated with one or more sets of identifying factors and stored as an index component for each of those sets. For example the behaviors may include other addresses where the same asset is frequently spotted.

For each of the possible sets of identifying characteristics a number of aspects surrounding the location of interest may also be stored as part of the location index. For example location index may also store data relating to the recency of the LPR data associated with location timestamps associated with the data or GPS and other geo location data associated with the underlying historical data that may be helpful when determining the location of interest. In the case of vehicles the location index may also store data associated with each target vehicle such as any address associated with the registered vehicle owner s registration or those that may be determined based on patterns of vehicle use. For example patterns of vehicle use may be determined by comparing geo location data associated with hits on the vehicle license plate as well as quantity of hits on the same vehicle concentration of the hits near a specific location and consistency and frequency of the hits location within a measured period of time. Additional factors and components may also be considered by the system as needed. A location index will generally consist of a number of these factors as well as any inferences that may be generated by processing the historical data using one or more system algorithms such as patterns of behavior .

Depending on the needs of the particular system user a proximity alert interest will generally be generated using the various aspects of historical LPR data that are stored as components in the location index for the particular location of an interest. Additionally the system may determine that a proximity alert should be generated based on the stored patterns of vehicle operation that are generated and determined by one or more system algorithms. These system algorithms may process various aspects of the historical LPR data in order to identify patterns of operation for a particular vehicle or group of vehicles. These patterns will then be stored by the system. The system may also compare newly received data to the stored patterns of operation in order to identify any new patterns of operation and to store those new patterns as a behavior component in the location index. For example the system may process newly received LPR data in order to identify any abnormalities or changes in patterns of vehicle operation that may affect the likelihood that a vehicle can be successfully recovered at a particular location. Any such identified change in vehicle operation can be stored to the location index as a new vehicle behavior. The process for determining when a proximity alert should be generated as well as the processes for identifying patterns in vehicle behavior may also utilize heuristic and optimization approaches to improve the accuracy of the algorithms. For instance the processes may utilize machine learning or geospatial analysis to assign relative weights to each component of a location index or to further optimize the processing of LPR data in order to identify patterns of vehicle operation.

The process for generating proximity alerts can be adapted and used in a number of different user specific contexts. While a number of applications of the process and of the location index have been identified in connection with the present disclosure it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that the described applications of the recoverability index are merely exemplary and that many more embodiments and implementations are envisioned within the spirit and scope of the present disclosure. The location index is adaptable and scalable and may utilize historical LPR data to generate proximity alerts for locations of interest for nearly any application.
