Histone deacetylases HDACs catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from histones proteins that organize and modulate the structure of chromatin in nucleosomes. HDAC mediated deacetylation of chromatin bound histones regulates the expression of a variety of genes throughout the genome. Importantly HDACs have been linked to cancer as well as other health conditions. To date eleven major HDAC isoforms have been described HDACs 1 11 . HDACs are categorized into two classes. Class I HDACs include HDAC1 HDAC2 HDAC3 HDAC8 and HDAC11. Class II HDACs include HDAC4 HDAC5 HDAC6 HDAC7 HDAC9 and HDAC10. Small molecule HDAC inhibitors that are isoform selective are useful as therapeutic agents with reduced toxicity and as tools for probing the biology of the HDAC isoforms.

Covalent modification of histone proteins through acetylation and deacetylation is an important determinant of chromatin structure and a regulator of gene expression. Acetylation of histone proteins occurs on lysine residues near the N termini of these proteins. In conjunction with other modifications of histone proteins and DNA the acetylation state of histones determines whether the chromatin is in a condensed transcriptionally silent state or in a form more accessible to the transcription machinery of the cell. In general hyperacetylation of histone proteins is associated with transcriptional activation of genes. The steady state histone acetylation level arises from the opposing action of histone acetyltransferase HAT and histone deacetylase HDAC enzymes.

Histone deacetylases HDACs catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from lysine amino groups near the N termini of histones. This reaction promotes the condensation of chromatin leading to repression of transcription.

HDAC inhibitors HDIs modify gene expression positively or negatively in a cell and gene specific manner. HDIs increase the accumulation of acetylated histones directly influencing chromatin structure and thereby the relationship of the nucleosome to gene promoter elements.

Histone deacetylase HDAC enzymes modulate gene expression through the deacetylation of acetylated lysine residues on histone proteins. They operate in biological systems as part of multiprotein corepressor complexes. Histone deacetylases have been grouped into three classes. Class I and class II histone deacetylases HDACs are zinc containing hydrolase enzymes. The division of the proteins into classes I and II is based on protein size sequence similarity and organization of the protein domains.

Members of class I are related to the yeast RPD3 gene product. Class I HDACs include HDAC1 GenBank Accession Number NP 004955 Wolffe A. P. 272 5260 371 372 1996 HDAC2 GenBank Accession Number NP 001518 Furukawa et al. 73 1 2 130 133 1996 HDAC3 GenBank Accession Number NP 003874 Yang et al. 272 44 28001 28007 1997 HDAC8 GenBank Accession Number NP 060956 Buggy et al. 350 Pt 1 199 205 2000 HDAC11 GenBank Accession Number NP 079103 Gao L. et al. 277 28 25748 25755 2002 .

HDAC8 is a 377 residue 42 kDa protein localized to the nucleus of a wide array of tissues as well as several human tumor cell lines. The wild type form of full length HDAC8 is described in GenBank Accession Number NP 060956 Buggy J. J. et al. 350 Pt 1 199 205 2000 . The HDAC8 structure was solved with four different hydroxamate inhibitors bound Somoza et al. 2004 12 1325 

Class II are homologues of the yeast HDA1 protein de Ruijter et. al. 2003 370 Pt 3 737 49 and include 

HDAC4 GenBank Accession Number NP 006028 Wolffe A. P. 387 6628 16 17 1997 HDAC5 GenBank Accession Number NP 631944 Nagase T. et al. 5 1 31 39 1998 HDAC6 GenBank Accession Number NP 006035 Wolffe A. P. 387 6628 16 17 1997 HDAC7 GenBank Accession Number NP 057680 Kao H. Y. et al. 14 1 55 66 2000 HDAC9 GenBank Accession Number NP 478056 Sparrow et al. 18 18 5085 5098 1999 HDAC10 GenBank Accession Number NP 114408 Kao H. Y. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 277 1 187 193 2002 .

Class II HDACs have been further subdivided into classes IIa HDACs 4 5 7 and 9 and IIb HDACs 6 and 10 .

The third class of deacetylases consists of the members of the Sir2 family of enzymes. These enzymes have histone deacetylase activity but are structurally and evolutionarily unrelated to the class I and class II proteins. They are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD dependent and unlike class I HDACs and class II HDACs they do not contain a catalytic zinc site

In the cell HDAC proteins are recruited as part of multicomponent repressor complexes. Several HDAC containing complexes have been characterized including the N CoR SMRT Sin3 NuRD and CoREST complexes. Within these complexes HDACs 1 and 2 typically interact with the mSin3 Mi 2 or CoREST proteins. HDAC3 and the class IIa HDACs have been shown to interact with SMRT and the related N CoR protein. A large number of transcription factors have been shown to bind to one of the corepressor complexes as a means of regulating transcription. The recruitment of HDACs by DNA binding proteins allows histone deacetylation to be directed toward specific regions of the chromatin in order to promote targeted transcriptional repression

HDAC proteins are promising therapeutic targets on account of their involvement in regulating genes involved in cell cycle progression and control. Inhibition of HDACs has been shown to upregulate genes including p21WAF CIP1 p p53 and cyclin E and to downregulate genes such as cyclin A and cyclin D. Growth inhibition in several lines of cancer cells has been observed upon treatment with HDAC inhibitors and in vivo studies have shown that some of these inhibitors are efficacious in slowing tumor growth. The biological activity of each of the HDAC isozymes is determined by a combination of the intrinsic activity of the enzyme and the effects of cofactor binding on reactivity and substrate recognition Schultz et al. 2004 43 11083 11091 .

Methods for determining HDAC activity in vivo or in vitro are known in the art as disclosed in e.g. Kim et al. 2006 325 273 283.

Non selective HDAC inhibitors inhibit the deacetylase activity of most if not all of the HDACs with equal potency. The mechanisms of the anticancer effects of SAHA a non selective HDAC inhibitor are not completely understood and likely result from both altered gene expression and altered function of proteins regulating cell proliferation and cell death pathways. Non selective HDAC inhibitors such as SAHA can induce the accumulation of acetylated histone proteins and non histone proteins. Non histone proteins that are acetylated include but are not limited to

The pharmaceutical industry seeks novel anti cancer therapies targeting the underlying molecular defects that cause cancer with less toxicity than traditional chemotherapy Miller et al. 2003 vol. 46 no. 24 5097 5116 . The inappropriate deacetylation of tumour suppressor genes a molecular defect may silence these genes resulting in the progression of cancer. HDAC inhibitors selectively switch on these tumour suppressor genes something traditional chemotherapy may not do.

HDAC enzymes or isoforms appear to be involved in many different types of cancer. Inhibition of HDACs with HDAC inhibitors results in multiple and desirable anti cancer effects such as but not limited to i the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation ii the induction of apoptosis cell death of cancer cells iii cell cycle regulation iv the induction of tumour suppressor genes and v the blocking of tumour angiogenesis development of new tumour blood vessels . These multiple effects provided by HDAC inhibitors provide a method of treating cancer.

Interest in histone deacetylase enzymes HDACs as targets for pharmaceutical development has centered on the role of HDACs in regulating genes associated with cell cycle progression and the development and progression of cancer Kramer et. al. 12 294 300 2001 . Several studies have shown that treatment of various cell lines with HDAC inhibitors leads to hyper acetylation of histone proteins and cell cycle arrest in late Gphase or at the G M transition. Genes involved in the cell cycle that have been shown to be up regulated by HDAC inhibitors include p21 p27 p53 and cyclin E. Cyclin A and cyclin D have been reported to be down regulated by HDAC inhibitors. In tumor cell lines several studies have shown that treatment with HDAC inhibitors can lead to growth inhibition growth arrest terminal differentiation and or apoptosis. In vivo studies have demonstrated growth inhibition of tumors and a reduction in tumor metastasis as a result of treatment with HDAC inhibitors.

The clearest link between abnormal HDAC activity and cancer occurs in acute promyelocytic leukemia. In this condition a chromosomal translocation leads to the fusion of the retinoic acid receptor RAR with the promyelocytic leukemia PML or promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger PLZF proteins. Both PML RAR and PLZF RAR promote the progression of leukemia by repressing retinoic acid regulated genes through the abnormal recruitment of SMRT mSin3 HDAC complex Lin et. al. 391 811 814 1998 Grignani et al. 391 815 818 1998 . Whereas the PML RAR form of the disease is treatable with retinoic acid the PLZF RAR form is resistant to this treatment. For a patient with the retinoic acid resistant form of the disease the addition of the HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate to the dosing regimen led to complete clinical and cytogenic remission Warrell et al. 90 1621 1625 1998 . HDACs have also been associated with Huntington s disease Steffan et al. 413 739 744 Histone deacetylase inhibitors arrest polyglutamine dependent neurodegeneration in .

In general almost all of the inhibitors targeting HDACs are broad spectrum compounds inhibiting all of the HDAC isoforms with equal potency. These broad spectrum HDAC inhibitors cause the induction of differentiation growth arrest and or apoptosis in a large number of tumor cell lines in vitro.

Clinical administration of broad spectrum HDAC inhibitors pan HDAC inhibitors has been associated with many dose limiting toxicities. These include thrombocytopenia and other hematological toxicities QTc prolongation and other cardiac toxicities nausea fever fatigue and anorexia For example see 2003 9 10 3578 35882002 8 7 2142 2148 and 2005 46 Abs 3978 . Selective HDAC inhibitors that selectively inhibit only one HDAC isoform as opposed to a pan selective inhibitor is expected to produce a drug with an improved toxicity profile.

Adverse effects in humans have been reported in several clinical trials using pan HDAC inhibitors Kelly et al. 2003 . Phase I clinical trial of histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid administered intravenously. 9 3578 3588. Kelly et al. 2005 . Phase I study of an oral histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid in patients with advanced cancer. 10 3923 3931.2003 2005 Ryan et al. 2005 . Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of MS 275 a histone deacetylase inhibitor in patients with advanced and refractory solid tumors or lymphoma. 10 3912 3922.2005 . Originally designed for oncological applications such toxicities might not be crucial when taking into consideration their therapeutic effects and the high mortality rate of cancer. HDAC inhibitor compounds with reduced toxicities would be beneficial and could be used in the treatment of diseases or conditions other than cancer.

There is an ongoing need for compositions and therapeutic methods based on inhibition of specific histone deacetylases. Described herein are selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds. Compounds described herein selectively inhibit HDAC8 over other HDAC isoforms e.g. HDACs 1 2 3 6 10 and 11 .

As described herein HDAC8 is expressed primarily in delta cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas in small intestinal epithelial cells and in neuroendocrine cells. Of note delta cells express and secrete somatostatin a peptide hormone that inhibits the secretion of insulin and growth hormone. Without being bound by theory it is believed that HDAC8 activity drives the expression of somatostatin in delta cells. Thus inhibiting HDAC8 activitity is expected to decrease somatostatin expression and secretion from delta cells and consequently increase systemic insulin and growth hormone levels.

Described herein are methods for inhibiting somatostatin expression in a subject by administering to the subject a selective HDAC8 inhibitor composition. Further described herein are methods for treating a subject suffering from an insulin deficiency or a growth hormone deficiency by administering a selective HDAC8 inhibitor to the subject.

HDAC8 is expressed at unusually high levels in tumor cell lines e.g. Jurkat HuT78 K562 PC3 and OVCR 3. In fact as described herein inhibiting HDAC8 activity decreases proliferation of T cell derived tumor cells e.g. Jurkat cells by apoptosis. In contrast HDAC8 inhibition does not affect the proliferation of either non cancerous cells e.g. peripheral blood mononuclear cells or tumor cell lines other than T cell derived lines. Thus selective HDAC8 inhibitors are useful for slowing or arresting the progression of T cell derived cancers with lessened or no toxicity to non cancerous cells.

Selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein were screened against a large panel of tumor cell lines in vitro and were found to induce apoptosis in cell lines derived from T cell lymphomas or leukemias. Selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein at low micromolar concentrations inhibits the growth of Jurkat and HuT78 cell lines while doses as high as 20 micromolar have no effect on B cell or myeloid derived lymphomas or solid tumor lines. Unlike broad spectrum inhibitors selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein do not cause detectable histone or tubulin acetylation but lead to a dose dependent decrease in HDAC8 protein levels in treated cells. Selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein activated caspases 3 8 and 9 showing that both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptic pathways were involved accordingly apoptosis was blocked completely by pan caspase inhibitors but only partially by inhibitors of specific caspases. Thus selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein may be of benefit in the treatment of T cell lymphomas and leukemias.

Described herein are methods for treating a subject suffering from a T cell lymphoma by administering to the subject a selective HDAC8 inhibitor composition. Also described herein are methods for treating a subject suffering from a T cell lymphoma by administering to the subject a population of autologous T cells that have been exposed to a selective HDAC8 inhibitor composition ex vivo.

Selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds and compositions thereof can be used to treat a subject suffering from a T cell lymphoma e.g. a peripheral T cell lymphoma a lymphoblastic lymphoma a cutaneous T cell lymphoma or an adult T cell lymphoma.

In some embodiments the T cell lymphoma treatment method includes administering to a subject a therapeutically effective amount of a selective HDAC8 inhibitor pharmaceutical composition.

In other embodiments the T cell lymphoma treatment can include administering in addition to a selective HDAC8 inhibitor pharmaceutical composition one or more additional anti cancer agents described herein in any combination.

The methods described herein include administering a pharmaceutical composition containing a selective HDAC8 inhibitor in a quantity sufficient to decrease HDAC8 deacetylase activity in vivo by a therapeutically effective amount. In some embodiments cells derived from a subject to be treated i.e. autologous cells are exposed ex vivo to a pharmaceutical composition containing a selective HDAC8 inhibitor composition in a quantity sufficient to decrease HDAC8 deacetylase activity in vitro.

In one embodiment T cells from a donor subject suffering a T cell lymphoma are cultured and expanded ex vivo in the presence of a selective HDAC8 inhibitor at a concentration that is effective for selectively killing transformed T cells. Afterwards the expanded T cell population free of transformed T cells can be introduced into the donor subject. T cell culture in vitro expansion and in vivo transfer is described in e.g. Porter et al. 2006 107 4 1325 1331 Rapoport et al. 2005 1230 1237 Laport et al. 2003 102 6 2004 2013.

Pan HDAC inhibitors have been examined for their application in immunological disorders. Cytokine production is regulated through selective patterns of histone acetylation Avni et al. 2002 3 643 . It is known that broad spectrum HDAC inhibitors e.g. suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid SAHA trichostatin TSA decrease LPS stimulated cytokine production in vitro and in vivo and have anti inflammatory properties Leoni et al. 2002 99 2995 Mascagni et al. International Patent Publication WO 03 013493 . Nonselective HDAC inhibitors such as SAHA and TSA have also been shown to antagonize systemic lupus erythematosus in a mouse model International patent publication WO 02 55017 Mishra et al. 2003 111 539 .

Histone deacetylase inhibitors prevent exocytosis of interleukin 1b containing secretory lysosomes. A functional microtubule network is required for IL 1b secretion and disruption of tubulin is the mechanism by which HDAC inhibitors reduce cytokine secretion Carta et al. 2006 1 108 5 1618 26 . Carta et al. examined the effects of pan HDAC inhibitors e.g. SAHA TSA on IL 1b secretion and concluded that the effects of the pan HDAC inhibitors on secretion of IL 1b is acheived by the inhibition cytoplasmic HDAC6. Carta et al. also showed that HDAC inhibitors inhibit the secretion of IL 1b but do not inhibit the synthesis of its presursor.

As described herein selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein reduce the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines including but not limited to interleukin 1 beta IL 1b . Thus HDAC8 is the HDAC enzyme involved in cytokine secretion. The use of selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds provides a method of reducing cytokine secretion with reduced toxicity due to the selective inhibition of one HDAC isoform vs. the use of pan HDAC inhibitors that inhibit all of the HDAC isoforms .

Selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein inhibit in a dose dependent fashion lipopolysaccharide LPS and or ATP stimulated secretion of IL 1b from purified human peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs as well as from the monocyte cell line THP 1. In some embodiments the ECfor inhibition ranges from 0.5 micromolar to 5 micromolar.

The production and secretion of IL 1b is via a non classical pathway of protein secretion involving potassium efflux the autocatalytic processing of procaspase 1 the cleavage by active caspase 1 of the IL 1b precursor the influx of calcium ions and the activation of specific phospholipases including PLA 2. Selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein inhibit one or more steps in this secretory pathway.

Selective HDAC8 inhibitors may be used to treat diseases or conditions that are mediated or linked to IL 1b secretion and activity. Selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds may be used to treat autoimmune diseases or conditions in which IL 1b is contributor to the signs and symptoms of the diseases or conditions Burger et al. Vol. 20 No. 5 pp. 879 896 2006 Dayer et al. 2001 13 170 176 Abramson et al. 2002 41 972 980 . Selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds may be used to inhibit IL 1b secretion and thus find utility in the treatment of diseases or conditions that are linked to IL 1b secretion and activity which include but are not limited to osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis septic arthritis gout pseudogout juvenile arthritis Still s disease Ankylosing spondylitis systemic lupus erythematosus SLE Henoch Sch nlein purpura psoriatic arthritis reactive arthritis Reiter s syndrome hemochromatosis hepatitis Wegener s granulomatosis Familial Mediterranean fever FMF HIDS hyperimmunoglobulinemia D and periodic fever syndrome TRAPS TNF alpha receptor associated periodic fever syndrome inflammatory bowel disease Crohn s Disease ulcerative colitis recurrent fever anemia leukocytosis asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease myalgia Adult Still s disease Systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis Lupus arthritis Ankylosing spondylitis familial Mediterranean fever FMF TNF receptor associated periodic syndrome TRAPS hyperimmunoglobulinemia D with periodic fever syndrome HIDS Blau syndrome FCAS MWS neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease NOMID and cryopyrin associated periodic syndrome CAPS familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome FCAS Muckle Wells syndrome MWS neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease NOMID chronic infantile neurologic cutaneous articular syndrome CINCA cryopyrin associated periodic syndrome CAPS pyogenic sterile arthritis pyoderma gangrenosum and acne syndrome PAPA .

Chronic inflammation in patients has been linked to cancer development Coussens et al. 420 860 867 2002 . Cancers associated with chronic inflammation include but are not limited to lung esophageal gastric pancreatic cervical bladder prostate and colorectal cancers. The role of the inflammatory microenvironment as a causative factor in the etiology of cancer is also supported by findings that regular use of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs NSAIDs is associated with a reduced incidence of colorectal breast and gastric cancer. Pro inflammatory cytokines are mediators of chronic inflammatory responses and have effects on malignant processes.

Pro inflammatory cytokines are involved in carcinogenesis and malignant transformation tumor growth invasion and metastasis. Persistent expression of proinflammatory cytokines in or near tumors exerts a range of effects including but not limited to increasing growth and invasiveness of the malignant cells metastsis tumorigenesis to activation of immune mediated mechanisms leading to the destruction of tumor cells and inhibition of tumor growth. IL 1b transfected tumor cells have been reported to fail to induce effective antitumor immune responses. In several human cancers local IL 1b expression by the malignant cells or the microenvironment has been associated with aggressive tumor growth and poor prognosis.

In IL 1b transfected fibrosarcoma cells an up regulation of MMP 2 and MMP 9 and TGF genes that are involved in invasiveness was observed as opposed to the shut off of these genes in IL 1 transfected fibrosarcomas cells. IL 1b may also enhance the invasiveness of already existing tumor cells by switching on angiogenesis and by the induction of inflammatory molecules such as MMPs heparanase chemokines or integrins on the malignant cells or endothelial cells leading to tumor dissemination and metastasis. Il 1b induces secretion of growth and invasiveness promoting factors e.g. matrix metalloproteinases and angiogenic factors i.e. VEGF and bFGF and ELR positive CXC chemokines i.e. IL 8 and MCP 1 . Apte et al. seminars in vol. 12 2002 277 290 .

Secreted IL 1b seems to be involved in tumor growth and invasion. Inhibition of IL 1b secretion e.g. by using selective HDAC8 compounds in malignant cells or in the tumor s microenvironment may provide a method for cancer therapy.

Thus in one embodiment selective HDAC8 compounds described herein may be used in cancer therapy. In one embodiment selective HDAC8 compounds described herein may be used in the treatment of sarcomas. In another embodiment selective HDAC8 compounds described herein may be used in the treatment of sarcomas selected from among alveolar soft part sarcoma angiosarcoma dermatofibrosarcoma desmoid tumor desmoplastic small round cell tumor extraskeletal chondrosarcoma extraskeletal osteosarcoma fibrosarcoma hemangiopericytoma hemangiosarcoma kaposi s sarcoma leiomyosarcoma liposarcoma lymphangiosarcoma malignant fibrous histiocytoma neurofibrosarcoma rhabdomyosarcoma synovial sarcoma askin s tumor ewing s malignant hemangioendothelioma malignant schwannoma osteosarcoma chondrosarcoma.

Any combination of the groups described above for the various variables is contemplated herein. It is understood that substituents and substitution patterns on the compounds provided herein can be selected by one of ordinary skill in the art to provide compounds that are chemically stable and that can be synthesized by techniques known in the art as well as those set forth herein.

Further embodiments of compounds described herein e.g. 1 3 disubstituted 1H indole 6 carboxylic acid hydroxyamide compounds 1 3 disubstituted 1H indole 5 carboxylic acid hydroxyamide compounds compounds of Formula I Formula Ia Formula Ib Formula IIa Formula IIb include but are not limited to compounds in Tables 1 and 2.

Throughout the specification groups and substituents thereof can be chosen by one skilled in the field to provide stable moieties and compounds.

Compounds described herein may possess one or more stereocenters and each center may exist in the R or S configuration. The compounds presented herein include all diastereomeric enantiomeric and epimeric forms as well as the appropriate mixtures thereof. Separation of steroisomers may be performed by chromatography. Alternatively individual stereoisomers may be obtained by reacting a racemic mixture of the compound with an optically active resolving agent to form a pair of diastereoisomeric compounds separating the diastereomers and recovering the optically pure enantiomers. While resolution of enantiomers can be carried out using covalent diastereomeric derivatives of the compounds described herein dissociable complexes are also possible e.g. crystalline diastereomeric salts . Diastereomers have distinct physical properties e.g. melting points boiling points solubilities reactivity etc. and can be readily separated by taking advantage of these dissimilarities. The diastereomers can be separated by chiral chromatography or by separation resolution techniques based upon differences in solubility. The optically pure enantiomer s is are then recovered along with the resolving agent by any practical means that would not result in racemization. A more detailed description of the techniques applicable to the resolution of stereoisomers of compounds from their racemic mixture can be found in Jean Jacques Andre Collet Samuel H. Wilen Enantiomers Racemates and Resolutions John Wiley And Sons Inc. 1981 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Stereoisomers may also be obtained by stereoselective synthesis.

In some situations compounds may exist as tautomers. All tautomers are included within the formulas described herein.

The methods and formulations described herein include the use of N oxides crystalline forms also known as polymorphs or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds described herein as well as active metabolites of these compounds having the same type of activity. In some situations compounds may exist as tautomers. All tautomers are included within the scope of the compounds presented herein. In addition the compounds described herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water ethanol and the like. The solvated forms of the compounds presented herein are also considered to be disclosed herein.

Indole compounds described herein in unoxidized form can be prepared from the corresponding N oxides indole compounds by treating with a reducing agent such as but not limited to sulfur sulfur dioxide triphenyl phosphine lithium borohydride sodium borohydride phosphorus trichloride phosphorus tribromide or the like in a suitable inert organic solvent such as but not limited to acetonitrile ethanol aqueous dioxane or the like at 0 to 80 C.

In some embodiments compounds described herein are prepared as prodrugs. A prodrug refers to an agent that is converted into the parent drug in vivo. Prodrugs are often useful because in some situations they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may for instance be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. An example without limitation of a prodrug would be a compound described herein which is administered as an ester the prodrug to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid the active entity once inside the cell where water solubility is beneficial. A further example of a prodrug might be a short peptide polyaminoacid bonded to an acid group where the peptide is metabolized to reveal the active moiety. In certain embodiments upon in vivo administration a prodrug is chemically converted to the biologically pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. In certain embodiments a prodrug is enzymatically metabolized by one or more steps or processes to the biologically pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound.

To produce a prodrug a pharmaceutically active compound is modified such that the active compound will be regenerated upon in vivo administration. The prodrug can be designed to alter the metabolic stability or the transport characteristics of a drug to mask side effects or toxicity to improve the flavor of a drug or to alter other characteristics or properties of a drug. By virtue of knowledge of pharmacodynamic processes and drug metabolism in vivo those of skill in this art once a pharmaceutically active compound is known can design prodrugs of the compound. see for example Nogrady 1985 Oxford University Press New York pages 388 392 Silverman 1992 Academic Press Inc. San Diego pages 352 401 Saulnier et al. 1994 Vol. 4 p. 1985 Rooseboom et al. 56 53 102 2004 Miller et al. . Vol. 46 no. 24 5097 5116 2003 Aesop Cho Recent Advances in Oral Prodrug Discovery 41 395 407 2006 .

Prodrug forms of the herein described compounds wherein the prodrug is metabolized in vivo to produce a derivative as set forth herein are included within the scope of the claims. In some cases some of the herein described compounds may be a prodrug for another derivative or active compound.

Prodrugs are often useful because in some situations they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may for instance be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. Prodrugs may be designed as reversible drug derivatives for use as modifiers to enhance drug transport to site specific tissues. In some embodiments the design of a prodrug increases the effective water solubility. See e.g. Fedorak et al. 269 G210 218 1995 McLoed et al. 106 405 413 1994 Hochhaus et al. 6 283 286 1992 J. Larsen and H. Bundgaard 37 87 1987 J. Larsen et al. 47 103 1988 Sinkula et al. 64 181 210 1975 T. Higuchi and V. Stella 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series and Edward B. Roche American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press 1987 all incorporated herein in their entirety.

Sites on the aromatic ring portion of compounds described herein can be susceptible to various metabolic reactions therefore incorporation of appropriate substituents on the aromatic ring structures such as by way of example only halogens can reduce minimize or eliminate this metabolic pathway.

The compounds described herein may be labeled isotopically e.g. with a radioisotope or by other means including but not limited to the use of chromophores or fluorescent moieties bioluminescent labels or chemiluminescent labels.

The compounds described herein and other related compounds having different substituents can be synthesized using techniques and materials described herein as well as those that are known to those of skill in the art such as described for example in Fieser and Fieser s Reagents for Organic Synthesis Volumes 1 17 John Wiley and Sons 1991 Rodd s Chemistry of Carbon Compounds Volumes 1 5 and Supplementals Elsevier Science Publishers 1989 Organic Reactions Volumes 1 40 John Wiley and Sons 1991 Larock s Comprehensive Organic Transformations VCH Publishers Inc. 1989 March AOC4Ed. Wiley 1992 Carey and Sundberg AOC4Ed. Vols. A and B Plenum 2000 2001 and Green and Wuts PGOS3Ed. Wiley 1999 all of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety . General methods for the preparation of compound as disclosed herein may be derived from known reactions in the field and the reactions may be modified by the use of appropriate reagents and conditions as would be recognized by the skilled person for the introduction of the various moieties found in the formulae as provided herein. As a guide the following synthetic methods may be utilized.

Indole compounds described herein may be synthesized starting from indole compounds that are available from commercial sources or they can be prepared using procedures known in the art or outlined herein.

Using the reaction conditions described herein 1 3 substituted 1H indole 5 carboxylic acid hydroxyamides and 1 3 substituted 1H indole 6 carboxylic acid hydroxyamides as disclosed herein are obtained in good yields and purity. The compounds prepared by the methods disclosed herein are purified by conventional means known in the art such as for example filtration recrystallization chromatography distillation and combinations thereof.

Schemes presented herein are merely illustrative of some methods by which the compounds described herein can be synthesized and various modifications to these schemes can be made and will be suggested to one skilled in the art having referred to this disclosure.

The compounds described herein can be modified using various electrophiles and or nucleophiles to form new functional groups or substituents. Table 3 entitled Examples of Covalent Linkages and Precursors Thereof lists selected non limiting examples of covalent linkages and precursor functional groups which yield the covalent linkages. Table 3 may be used as guidance toward the variety of electrophiles and nucleophiles combinations available that provide covalent linkages. Precursor functional groups are shown as electrophilic groups and nucleophilic groups.

In the reactions described it may be necessary to protect reactive functional groups for example hydroxy amino imino thio or carboxy groups where these are desired in the final product in order to avoid their unwanted participation in reactions. Protecting groups are used to block some or all of the reactive moieties and prevent such groups from participating in chemical reactions until the protective group is removed. It is preferred that each protective group be removable by a different means. Protective groups that are cleaved under totally disparate reaction conditions fulfill the requirement of differential removal.

Protective groups can be removed by acid base reducing conditions such as for example hydrogenolysis and or oxidative conditions. Groups such as trityl dimethoxytrityl acetal and t butyldimethylsilyl are acid labile and may be used to protect carboxy and hydroxy reactive moieties in the presence of amino groups protected with Cbz groups which are removable by hydrogenolysis and Fmoc groups which are base labile. Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may be blocked with base labile groups such as but not limited to methyl ethyl and acetyl in the presence of amines blocked with acid labile groups such as t butyl carbamate or with carbamates that are both acid and base stable but hydrolytically removable.

Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may also be blocked with hydrolytically removable protective groups such as the benzyl group while amine groups capable of hydrogen bonding with acids may be blocked with base labile groups such as Fmoc. Carboxylic acid reactive moieties may be protected by conversion to simple ester compounds as exemplified herein which include conversion to alkyl esters or they may be blocked with oxidatively removable protective groups such as 2 4 dimethoxybenzyl while co existing amino groups may be blocked with fluoride labile silyl carbamates.

Allyl blocking groups are useful in then presence of acid and base protecting groups since the former are stable and can be subsequently removed by metal or pi acid catalysts. For example an allyl blocked carboxylic acid can be deprotected with a Pd catalyzed reaction in the presence of acid labile t butyl carbamate or base labile acetate amine protecting groups. Yet another form of protecting group is a resin to which a compound or intermediate may be attached. As long as the residue is attached to the resin that functional group is blocked and cannot react. Once released from the resin the functional group is available to react.

Other protecting groups plus a detailed description of techniques applicable to the creation of protecting groups and their removal are described in Greene and Wuts Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis 3rd Ed.

In still other embodiments effervescent powders are also prepared in accordance with the present disclosure. Effervescent salts have been used to disperse medicines in water for oral administration. Effervescent salts are granules or coarse powders containing a medicinal agent in a dry mixture usually composed of sodium bicarbonate citric acid and or tartaric acid. When such salts are added to water the acids and the base react to liberate carbon dioxide gas thereby causing effervescence. Examples of effervescent salts include e.g. the following ingredients sodium bicarbonate or a mixture of sodium bicarbonate and sodium carbonate citric acid and or tartaric acid. Any acid base combination that results in the liberation of carbon dioxide can be used in place of the combination of sodium bicarbonate and citric and tartaric acids as long as the ingredients were suitable for pharmaceutical use and result in a pH of about 6.0 or higher.

In other embodiments the formulations described herein which include an indole compound described herein are solid dispersions. Methods of producing such solid dispersions are known in the art and include but are not limited to for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 343 789 5 340 591 5 456 923 5 700 485 5 723 269 and U.S. Pub. Appl 2004 0013734. In still other embodiments the formulations described herein are solid solutions. Solid solutions incorporate a substance together with the active agent and other excipients such that heating the mixture results in dissolution of the drug and the resulting composition is then cooled to provide a solid blend which can be further formulated or directly added to a capsule or compressed into a tablet. Methods of producing such solid solutions are known in the art and include but are not limited to for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 151 273 5 281 420 and 6 083 518.

The pharmaceutical solid oral dosage forms including formulations described herein which include an indole compound described herein can be further formulated to provide a controlled release of the indole compound. Controlled release refers to the release of the indole compound described herein from a dosage form in which it is incorporated according to a desired profile over an extended period of time. Controlled release profiles include for example sustained release prolonged release pulsatile release and delayed release profiles. In contrast to immediate release compositions controlled release compositions allow delivery of an agent to a subject over an extended period of time according to a predetermined profile. Such release rates can provide therapeutically effective levels of agent for an extended period of time and thereby provide a longer period of pharmacologic response while minimizing side effects as compared to conventional rapid release dosage forms. Such longer periods of response provide for many inherent benefits that are not achieved with the corresponding short acting immediate release preparations.

In some embodiments the solid dosage forms described herein can be formulated as enteric coated delayed release oral dosage forms i.e. as an oral dosage form of a pharmaceutical composition as described herein which utilizes an enteric coating to affect release in the small intestine of the gastrointestinal tract. The enteric coated dosage form may be a compressed or molded or extruded tablet mold coated or uncoated containing granules powder pellets beads or particles of the active ingredient and or other composition components which are themselves coated or uncoated. The enteric coated oral dosage form may also be a capsule coated or uncoated containing pellets beads or granules of the solid carrier or the composition which are themselves coated or uncoated.

The term delayed release as used herein refers to the delivery so that the release can be accomplished at some generally predictable location in the intestinal tract more distal to that which would have been accomplished if there had been no delayed release alterations. In some embodiments the method for delay of release is coating. Any coatings should be applied to a sufficient thickness such that the entire coating does not dissolve in the gastrointestinal fluids at pH below about 5 but does dissolve at pH about 5 and above. It is expected that any anionic polymer exhibiting a pH dependent solubility profile can be used as an enteric coating for the methods and compositions described herein to achieve delivery to the lower gastrointestinal tract. In some embodiments such polymers are anionic carboxylic polymers. In other embodiments the polymers and compatible mixtures thereof and some of their properties include but are not limited to 

Acrylic polymers. The performance of acrylic polymers primarily their solubility in biological fluids can vary based on the degree and type of substitution. Examples of suitable acrylic polymers include methacrylic acid copolymers and ammonium methacrylate copolymers. The Eudragit series E L S RL RS and NE Rohm Pharma are available as solubilized in organic solvent aqueous dispersion or dry powders. The Eudragit series RL NE and RS are insoluble in the gastrointestinal tract but are permeable and are used primarily for colonic targeting. The Eudragit series E dissolve in the stomach. The Eudragit series L L 30D and S are insoluble in stomach and dissolve in the intestine 

Cellulose Derivatives. Examples of suitable cellulose derivatives are ethyl cellulose reaction mixtures of partial acetate esters of cellulose with phthalic anhydride. The performance can vary based on the degree and type of substitution. Cellulose acetate phthalate CAP dissolves in pH 6. Aquateric FMC is an aqueous based system and is a spray dried CAP psuedolatex with particles 

Poly Vinyl Acetate Phthalate PVAP . PVAP dissolves in pH 5 and it is much less permeable to water vapor and gastric fluids.

In some embodiments the coating can and usually does contain a plasticizer and possibly other coating excipients such as colorants talc and or magnesium stearate which are well known in the art. Suitable plasticizers include triethyl citrate Citroflex 2 triacetin glyceryl triacetate acetyl triethyl citrate Citroflec A2 Carbowax 400 polyethylene glycol 400 diethyl phthalate tributyl citrate acetylated monoglycerides glycerol fatty acid esters propylene glycol and dibutyl phthalate. In particular anionic carboxylic acrylic polymers usually will contain 10 25 by weight of a plasticizer especially dibutyl phthalate polyethylene glycol triethyl citrate and triacetin. Conventional coating techniques such as spray or pan coating are employed to apply coatings. The coating thickness must be sufficient to ensure that the oral dosage form remains intact until the desired site of topical delivery in the intestinal tract is reached.

Colorants detackifiers surfactants antifoaming agents lubricants e.g. carnuba wax or PEG may be added to the coatings besides plasticizers to solubilize or disperse the coating material and to improve coating performance and the coated product.

In other embodiments the formulations described herein which include an indole compound described herein are delivered using a pulsatile dosage form. A pulsatile dosage form is capable of providing one or more immediate release pulses at predetermined time points after a controlled lag time or at specific sites. Pulsatile dosage forms including the formulations described herein may be administered using a variety of pulsatile formulations known in the art. For example such formulations include but are not limited to those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 011 692 5 017 381 5 229 135 and 5 840 329. Other pulsatile release dosage forms suitable for use with the present formulations include but are not limited to for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 871 549 5 260 068 5 260 069 5 508 040 5 567 441 and 5 837 284. In one embodiment the controlled release dosage form is pulsatile release solid oral dosage form including at least two groups of particles i.e. multiparticulate each containing the formulation described herein. The first group of particles provides a substantially immediate dose of the indole compound described herein upon ingestion by a mammal. The first group of particles can be either uncoated or include a coating and or sealant. The second group of particles includes coated particles which includes from about 2 to about 75 preferably from about 2.5 to about 70 and more preferably from about 40 to about 70 by weight of the total dose of the indole compound described herein in said formulation in admixture with one or more binders. The coating includes a pharmaceutically acceptable ingredient in an amount sufficient to provide a delay of from about 2 hours to about 7 hours following ingestion before release of the second dose. Suitable coatings include one or more differentially degradable coatings such as by way of example only pH sensitive coatings enteric coatings such as acrylic resins e.g. Eudragit EPO Eudragit L30D 55 Eudragit FS 30D Eudragit L100 55 Eudragit L100 Eudragit S100 Eudragit RD100 Eudragit E100 Eudragit L12.5 Eudragit S12.5 and Eudragit NE30D Eudragit NE 40D either alone or blended with cellulose derivatives e.g. ethylcellulose or non enteric coatings having variable thickness to provide differential release of the formulation that includes an indole compound described herein.

Many other types of controlled release systems known to those of ordinary skill in the art and are suitable for use with the formulations described herein.

In some embodiments the pharmaceutical formulations described herein can be self emulsifying drug delivery systems SEDDS . Emulsions are dispersions of one immiscible phase in another usually in the form of droplets. Generally emulsions are created by vigorous mechanical dispersion. SEDDS as opposed to emulsions or microemulsions spontaneously form emulsions when added to an excess of water without any external mechanical dispersion or agitation. An advantage of SEDDS is that only gentle mixing is required to distribute the droplets throughout the solution. Additionally water or the aqueous phase can be added just prior to administration which ensures stability of an unstable or hydrophobic active ingredient. Thus the SEDDS provides an effective delivery system for oral and parenteral delivery of hydrophobic active ingredients. SEDDS may provide improvements in the bioavailability of hydrophobic active ingredients. Methods of producing self emulsifying dosage forms are known in the art and include but are not limited to for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 858 401 6 667 048 and 6 960 563.

It is to be appreciated that there is overlap between the above listed additives used in the aqueous dispersions or suspensions described herein since a given additive is often classified differently by different practitioners in the field or is commonly used for any of several different functions. Thus the above listed additives should be taken as merely exemplary and not limiting of the types of additives that can be included in formulations described herein. The amounts of such additives can be readily determined by one skilled in the art according to the particular properties desired.

Intranasal formulations are known in the art and are described in for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 476 116 5 116 817 and 6 391 452. Formulations that include an indole compound described herein which are prepared according to these and other techniques well known in the art are prepared as solutions in saline employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives fluorocarbons and or other solubilizing or dispersing agents known in the art. See for example Ansel H. C. et al. Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems Sixth Ed. 1995 . Preferably these compositions and formulations are prepared with suitable nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients. These ingredients are known to those skilled in the preparation of nasal dosage forms and some of these can be found in REMINGTON THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF PHARMACY 21st edition 2005 a standard reference in the field. The choice of suitable carriers is highly dependent upon the exact nature of the nasal dosage form desired e.g. solutions suspensions ointments or gels. Nasal dosage forms generally contain large amounts of water in addition to the active ingredient. Minor amounts of other ingredients such as pH adjusters emulsifiers or dispersing agents preservatives surfactants gelling agents or buffering and other stabilizing and solubilizing agents may also be present. Preferably the nasal dosage form should be isotonic with nasal secretions.

For administration by inhalation the indole compounds described herein may be in a form as an aerosol a mist or a powder. Pharmaceutical compositions described herein are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebuliser with the use of a suitable propellant e.g. dichlorodifluoromethane trichlorofluoromethane dichlorotetrafluoroethane carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of such as by way of example only gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound described herein and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.

Buccal formulations that include indole compounds described herein may be administered using a variety of formulations known in the art. For example such formulations include but are not limited to U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 229 447 4 596 795 4 755 386 and 5 739 136. In addition the buccal dosage forms described herein can further include a bioerodible hydrolysable polymeric carrier that also serves to adhere the dosage form to the buccal mucosa. The buccal dosage form is fabricated so as to erode gradually over a predetermined time period wherein the delivery of the indole compound is provided essentially throughout. Buccal drug delivery as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art avoids the disadvantages encountered with oral drug administration e.g. slow absorption degradation of the active agent by fluids present in the gastrointestinal tract and or first pass inactivation in the liver. With regard to the bioerodible hydrolysable polymeric carrier it will be appreciated that virtually any such carrier can be used so long as the desired drug release profile is not compromised and the carrier is compatible with the indole compound described herein and any other components that may be present in the buccal dosage unit. Generally the polymeric carrier comprises hydrophilic water soluble and water swellable polymers that adhere to the wet surface of the buccal mucosa. Examples of polymeric carriers useful herein include acrylic acid polymers and co e.g. those known as carbomers Carbopol which may be obtained from B.F. Goodrich is one such polymer . Other components may also be incorporated into the buccal dosage forms described herein include but are not limited to disintegrants diluents binders lubricants flavoring colorants preservatives and the like. For buccal or sublingual administration the compositions may take the form of tablets lozenges or gels formulated in a conventional manner.

Transdermal formulations described herein may be administered using a variety of devices which have been described in the art. For example such devices include but are not limited to U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 598 122 3 598 123 3 710 795 3 731 683 3 742 951 3 814 097 3 921 636 3 972 995 3 993 072 3 993 073 3 996 934 4 031 894 4 060 084 4 069 307 4 077 407 4 201 211 4 230 105 4 292 299 4 292 303 5 336 168 5 665 378 5 837 280 5 869 090 6 923 983 6 929 801 and 6 946 144.

The transdermal dosage forms described herein may incorporate certain pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are conventional in the art. In one embodiments the transdermal formulations described herein include at least three components 1 a formulation of an indole compound described herein 2 a penetration enhancer and 3 an aqueous adjuvant. In addition transdermal formulations can include additional components such as but not limited to gelling agents creams and ointment bases and the like. In some embodiments the transdermal formulation can further include a woven or non woven backing material to enhance absorption and prevent the removal of the transdermal formulation from the skin. In other embodiments the transdermal formulations described herein can maintain a saturated or supersaturated state to promote diffusion into the skin.

Formulations suitable for transdermal administration of compounds described herein may employ transdermal delivery devices and transdermal delivery patches and can be lipophilic emulsions or buffered aqueous solutions dissolved and or dispersed in a polymer or an adhesive. Such patches may be constructed for continuous pulsatile or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents. Still further transdermal delivery of the compounds described herein can be accomplished by means of iontophoretic patches and the like. Additionally transdermal patches can provide controlled delivery of the indole compounds described herein. The rate of absorption can be slowed by using rate controlling membranes or by trapping the compound within a polymer matrix or gel. Conversely absorption enhancers can be used to increase absorption. An absorption enhancer or carrier can include absorbable pharmaceutically acceptable solvents to assist passage through the skin. For example transdermal devices are in the form of a bandage comprising a backing member a reservoir containing the compound optionally with carriers optionally a rate controlling barrier to deliver the compound to the skin of the host at a controlled and predetermined rate over a prolonged period of time and means to secure the device to the skin.

Formulations that include an indole compound described herein suitable for intramuscular subcutaneous or intravenous injection may include physiologically acceptable sterile aqueous or non aqueous solutions dispersions suspensions or emulsions and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. Examples of suitable aqueous and non aqueous carriers diluents solvents or vehicles including water ethanol polyols propyleneglycol polyethylene glycol glycerol cremophor and the like suitable mixtures thereof vegetable oils such as olive oil and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained for example by the use of a coating such as lecithin by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants. Formulations suitable for subcutaneous injection may also contain additives such as preserving wetting emulsifying and dispensing agents. Prevention of the growth of microorganisms can be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents such as parabens chlorobutanol phenol sorbic acid and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.

For intravenous injections compounds described herein may be formulated in aqueous solutions preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hank s solution Ringer s solution or physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal administration penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art.

Such excipients are generally known in the art.

Parenteral injections may involve bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form e.g. in ampoules or in multi dose containers with an added preservative. The pharmaceutical composition described herein may be in a form suitable for parenteral injection as a sterile suspensions solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending stabilizing and or dispersing agents. Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water soluble form. Additionally suspensions of the active compounds may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil or synthetic fatty acid esters such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose sorbitol or dextran. Optionally the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. Alternatively the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle e.g. sterile pyrogen free water before use.

In certain embodiments delivery systems for pharmaceutical compounds may be employed such as for example liposomes and emulsions. In certain embodiments compositions provided herein can also include an mucoadhesive polymer selected from among for example carboxymethylcellulose carbomer acrylic acid polymer poly methylmethacrylate polyacrylamide polycarbophil acrylic acid butyl acrylate copolymer sodium alginate and dextran.

The compounds described herein can be used in the preparation of medicaments for the inhibition of HDAC8 or for the treatment of diseases or conditions that would benefit at least in part from inhibition of HDAC8. In addition a method for treating any of the diseases or conditions described herein in a subject in need of such treatment involves administration of pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one indole compound described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt pharmaceutically acceptable N oxide pharmaceutically active metabolite pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug or pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof in therapeutically effective amounts to said subject.

The compositions containing the compound s described herein can be administered for prophylactic and or therapeutic treatments. In therapeutic applications the compositions are administered to a patient already suffering from a disease or condition in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease or condition. Amounts effective for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease or condition previous therapy the patient s health status weight and response to the drugs and the judgment of the treating physician. It is considered well within the skill of the art for one to determine such therapeutically effective amounts by routine experimentation including but not limited to a dose escalation clinical trial .

In prophylactic applications compositions containing the compounds described herein are administered to a patient susceptible to or otherwise at risk of a particular disease disorder or condition. Such an amount is defined to be a prophylactically effective amount or dose. In this use the precise amounts also depend on the patient s state of health weight and the like. It is considered well within the skill of the art for one to determine such prophylactically effective amounts by routine experimentation e.g. a dose escalation clinical trial . When used in a patient effective amounts for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease disorder or condition previous therapy the patient s health status and response to the drugs and the judgment of the treating physician.

In the case wherein the patient s condition does not improve upon the doctor s discretion the administration of the compounds may be administered chronically that is for an extended period of time including throughout the duration of the patient s life in order to ameliorate or otherwise control or limit the symptoms of the patient s disease or condition.

In the case wherein the patient s status does improve upon the doctor s discretion the administration of the compounds may be given continuously alternatively the dose of drug being administered may be temporarily reduced or temporarily suspended for a certain length of time i.e. a drug holiday . The length of the drug holiday can vary between 2 days and 1 year including by way of example only 2 days 3 days 4 days 5 days 6 days 7 days 10 days 12 days 15 days 20 days 28 days 35 days 50 days 70 days 100 days 120 days 150 days 180 days 200 days 250 days 280 days 300 days 320 days 350 days or 365 days. The dose reduction during a drug holiday may be from 10 100 including by way of example only 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 or 100 .

Once improvement of the patient s conditions has occurred a maintenance dose is administered if necessary. Subsequently the dosage or the frequency of administration or both can be reduced as a function of the symptoms to a level at which the improved disease disorder or condition is retained. Patients can however require intermittent treatment on a long term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms.

The amount of a given agent that will correspond to such an amount will vary depending upon factors such as the particular compound disease or condition and its severity the identity e.g. weight of the subject or host in need of treatment but can nevertheless be routinely determined in a manner known in the art according to the particular circumstances surrounding the case including e.g. the specific agent being administered the route of administration the condition being treated and the subject or host being treated. In general however doses employed for adult human treatment will typically be in the range of 0.02 5000 mg per day preferably 1 1500 mg per day. The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered simultaneously or over a short period of time or at appropriate intervals for example as two three four or more sub doses per day.

The pharmaceutical composition described herein may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. In unit dosage form the formulation is divided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of one or more compound. The unit dosage may be in the form of a package containing discrete quantities of the formulation. Non limiting examples are packaged tablets or capsules and powders in vials or ampoules. Aqueous suspension compositions can be packaged in single dose non reclosable containers. Alternatively multiple dose reclosable containers can be used in which case it is typical to include a preservative in the composition. By way of example only formulations for parenteral injection may be presented in unit dosage form which include but are not limited to ampoules or in multi dose containers with an added preservative.

The daily dosages appropriate for the compounds described herein described herein are from about 0.01 to 2.5 mg kg per body weight. An indicated daily dosage in the larger mammal including but not limited to humans is in the range from about 0.5 mg to about 100 mg conveniently administered in divided doses including but not limited to up to four times a day or in extended release form. Suitable unit dosage forms for oral administration include from about 1 to 50 mg active ingredient. The foregoing ranges are merely suggestive as the number of variables in regard to an individual treatment regime is large and considerable excursions from these recommended values are not uncommon. Such dosages may be altered depending on a number of variables not limited to the activity of the compound used the disease or condition to be treated the mode of administration the requirements of the individual subject the severity of the disease or condition being treated and the judgment of the practitioner.

Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such therapeutic regimens can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals including but not limited to the determination of the LD50 the dose lethal to 50 of the population and the ED50 the dose therapeutically effective in 50 of the population . The dose ratio between the toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio between LD50 and ED50. Compounds exhibiting high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with minimal toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized.

The compounds and compositions described herein can also be used in combination with other well known therapeutic agents that are selected for their therapeutic value for the condition to be treated. In general the compositions described herein and in embodiments where combinational therapy is employed other agents do not have to be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition and may because of different physical and chemical characteristics have to be administered by different routes. The determination of the mode of administration and the advisability of administration where possible in the same pharmaceutical composition is well within the knowledge of the skilled clinician. The initial administration can be made according to established protocols known in the art and then based upon the observed effects the dosage modes of administration and times of administration can be modified by the skilled clinician.

In certain instances it may be appropriate to administer at least one compound described herein in combination with another therapeutic agent. By way of example only if one of the side effects experienced by a patient upon receiving one of the compounds herein such as an indole hydroxamic acid compound described herein is nausea then it may be appropriate to administer an anti nausea agent in combination with the initial therapeutic agent. Or by way of example only the therapeutic effectiveness of one of the compounds described herein may be enhanced by administration of an adjuvant i.e. by itself the adjuvant may have minimal therapeutic benefit but in combination with another therapeutic agent the overall therapeutic benefit to the patient is enhanced . Or by way of example only the benefit experienced by a patient may be increased by administering one of the compounds described herein with another therapeutic agent which also includes a therapeutic regimen that also has therapeutic benefit. In any case regardless of the disease disorder or condition being treated the overall benefit experienced by the patient may simply be additive of the two therapeutic agents or the patient may experience a synergistic benefit.

The particular choice of compounds used will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgment of the condition of the patient and the appropriate treatment protocol. The compounds may be administered concurrently e.g. simultaneously essentially simultaneously or within the same treatment protocol or sequentially depending upon the nature of the disease disorder or condition the condition of the patient and the actual choice of compounds used. The determination of the order of administration and the number of repetitions of administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol is well within the knowledge of the skilled physician after evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition of the patient.

It is known to those of skill in the art that therapeutically effective dosages can vary when the drugs are used in treatment combinations. Methods for experimentally determining therapeutically effective dosages of drugs and other agents for use in combination treatment regimens are described in the literature. For example the use of metronomic dosing i.e. providing more frequent lower doses in order to minimize toxic side effects has been described extensively in the literature Combination treatment further includes periodic treatments that start and stop at various times to assist with the clinical management of the patient.

For combination therapies described herein dosages of the co administered compounds will of course vary depending on the type of co drug employed on the specific drug employed on the disease or condition being treated and so forth. In addition when co administered with one or more biologically active agents the compound provided herein may be administered either simultaneously with the biologically active agent s or sequentially. If administered sequentially the attending physician will decide on the appropriate sequence of administering protein in combination with the biologically active agent s .

In any case the multiple therapeutic agents one of which is a HDAC8 selective compound described herein may be administered in any order or even simultaneously. If simultaneously the multiple therapeutic agents may be provided in a single unified form or in multiple forms by way of example only either as a single pill or as two separate pills . One of the therapeutic agents may be given in multiple doses or both may be given as multiple doses. If not simultaneous the timing between the multiple doses may vary from more than zero weeks to less than four weeks. In addition the combination methods compositions and formulations are not to be limited to the use of only two agents the use of multiple therapeutic combinations are also envisioned.

It is understood that the dosage regimen to treat prevent or ameliorate the condition s for which relief is sought can be modified in accordance with a variety of factors. These factors include the disorder or condition from which the subject suffers as well as the age weight sex diet and medical condition of the subject. Thus the dosage regimen actually employed can vary widely and therefore can deviate from the dosage regimens set forth herein.

The pharmaceutical agents which make up the combination therapy disclosed herein may be a combined dosage form or in separate dosage forms intended for substantially simultaneous administration. The pharmaceutical agents that make up the combination therapy may also be administered sequentially with either therapeutic compound being administered by a regimen calling for two step administration. The two step administration regimen may call for sequential administration of the active agents or spaced apart administration of the separate active agents. The time period between the multiple administration steps may range from a few minutes to several hours depending upon the properties of each pharmaceutical agent such as potency solubility bioavailability plasma half life and kinetic profile of the pharmaceutical agent. Circadian variation of the target molecule concentration may also determine the optimal dose interval.

In addition the compounds described herein also may be used in combination with procedures that may provide additional or synergistic benefit to the patient. By way of example only patients are expected to find therapeutic and or prophylactic benefit in the methods described herein wherein pharmaceutical composition of a compound disclosed herein and or combinations with other therapeutics are combined with genetic testing to determine whether that individual is a carrier of a mutant gene that is known to be correlated with certain diseases or conditions.

The compounds described herein and combination therapies can be administered before during or after the occurrence of a disease or condition and the timing of administering the composition containing a compound can vary. Thus for example the compounds can be used as a prophylactic and can be administered continuously to subjects with a propensity to develop conditions or diseases in order to prevent the occurrence of the disease or condition. The compounds and compositions can be administered to a subject during or as soon as possible after the onset of the symptoms. The administration of the compounds can be initiated within the first 48 hours of the onset of the symptoms preferably within the first 48 hours of the onset of the symptoms more preferably within the first 6 hours of the onset of the symptoms and most preferably within 3 hours of the onset of the symptoms. The initial administration can be via any route practical such as for example an intravenous injection a bolus injection infusion over 5 minutes to about 5 hours a pill a capsule transdermal patch buccal delivery and the like or combination thereof.

Radiotherapy also called radiation therapy is the treatment of cancer and other diseases with ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation deposits energy that injures or destroys cells in an area being treated a target tissue by damaging their genetic material making it impossible for these cells to continue to grow. Although radiation damages both cancer cells and normal cells the latter are better able to repair themselves and function properly. Radiotherapy can be used to treat localized solid tumors such as cancers of the skin tongue larynx brain breast prostate colon uterus and or cervix. It can also be used to treat leukemia and lymphoma cancers of the blood forming cells and lymphatic system respectively .

A technique for delivering radiation to cancer cells is to place radioactive implants directly in a tumor or body cavity. This is called internal radiotherapy brachytherapy interstitial irradiation and intracavitary irradiation are types of internal radiotherapy. Using internal radiotherapy the radiation dose is concentrated in a small area and the patient stays in the hospital for a few days. Internal radiotherapy is frequently used for cancers of the tongue uterus prostate colon and cervix.

HDAC8 expression was assessed by immunocytochemistry in a normal human multi tissue panel paraffin embedded and formalin fixed prior to antibody staining. Detection of HDAC8 was replicated using two independently derived anti HDAC8 antibodies HDAC8 SC11405 Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog SC 11405 rabbit polyclonal and HDAC8 Celera at an optimal concentration of 10 g ml. Primary antibody labeling was detected using a Vector anti rabbit secondary BA 1000 and a Vector ABC AP kit AK 5000 with a Vector Red substrate kit SK 5100 . As shown in HDAC8 expression was found to be highest in pancreatic islets islets of Langerhans and in small intestine.

In a follow up experiment pancreatic tissue double labeling immunocytochemistry was performed for HDAC8 insulin HDAC8 glucagon and HDAC8 somatostatin . Significantly HDAC8 expression was co localized specifically with somatostatin a polypeptide marker of pancreatic delta cells.

Based on these data it was concluded that under normal physiological conditions HDAC8 expression is highest in pancreatic islet cells expressing somatostatin i.e. delta cells and may play a role in driving somatostatin expression

HDAC8 expression was determined by immunoblotting and quantitative RT PCR Q PCR in a variety of tumor cell lines including the Ramos Raji DHL 4 Jurkat HuT78 DB K562 A549 HCT 116 MCF 7 OVCR 3 PC3 RKO and U87 cell lines.

HDAC8 expression was detected by in all tumor cell lines in contrast to the highly restricted expression pattern observed in normal tissues.

As shown in . HDAC8 protein expression is modulated in a dose dependent manner by both the HDAC8 selective inhibitors and the pan HDAC inhibitor PCI 24781. Western blot of HDAC8 HDAC1 after 24 hr treatment in Jurkat cells were obtained. HDAC1 levels are decreased by PCI 24781 but not by compound 23 whereas HDAC8 is affected by both treatments. Thus HDAC8 protein levels could be a pharmacodynamic marker for selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds.

RNAi knockdown of HDAC8 in HeLa cells was shown to induce apoptosis as demonstrated by increased caspase activity . As shown in apoptosis measured by annexin V propidium iodide flow cytometry induced by 5 M compound 23 is blocked by 10 M qVD OPh which is a pan caspase inhibitor.

Candidate selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds were assayed for their ability to inhibit in vitro HDAC8 deacetylase activity as well as deacetylase activity of HDACs 1 2 3 6 and 10. ICvalues were determined as outlined in Schultz et. al. Kinetics and Comparative Reactivity of Human Class I and Class IIb Histone Deacetylases 43 34 11083 11091 2004. For comparison broad spectrum HDAC inhibitors CRA 024781 and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid SAHA were also assayed in parallel. Inhibition constants were obtained using the program BatchKi Kuzmic et al. 2000 286 45 50 .

The results are summarized in Table 4 below. Methods for determining HDAC activity in vivo or in vitro are known in the art as disclosed in e.g. Kim et al. 2006 325 273 283.

The data presented above show that compounds described herein are selective inhibitors of HDAC8. Compounds described herein have HDAC8 ICvalues that are less than 100 nM and are at least 10 fold less than ICvalues for other HDAC isoforms HDAC1 HDAC2 HDAC3 HDAC6 HDAC10 . In comparison pan HDAC inhibitors tested have HDAC8 ICvalues that are greater than 100 nM do not show isoform selectivity less than 2 fold selectivity observed . This would indicate that compounds described herein would possess less toxicity due to the selective inhibition of HDAC8.

The ability of HDAC8 selective inhibitor compounds described herein e.g. compound 23 to reduce tumor cell proliferation in vitro was determined for several cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs .

As shown in compound 23 was relatively ineffective for inhibiting the growth of any of the H33HJ JA1 lymphoma the OVCAR 3 ovary MIA PaCa 2 pancreas or PANC 1 pancreas tumor cell lines in comparison to the established anti proliferative agent mitomycin. Likewise Compound 23 failed to inhibit the growth of the HCT116 human colon carcinoma cell line or PBMCs . In contrast Compound 23 was cytotoxic to the Jurkat and HuT78 T cell derived tumor cell lines whereas the B cell derived cell lines DB and K562 were not affected . Based on these data we conclude that the selective HDAC8 inhibitor compound effectively and specifically inhibits proliferation of T cell tumor cells.

siRNA protein knockdown experiments suggested that HDAC8 selective inhibitors would induce apoptosis or growth arrest in solid tumor cells. However no cytotoxicity was observed in 8 tumor lines with the selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein Table 5 . The lack of concordance highlights the differences between protein knockdown by siRNA and selective active site enzyme inhibition with small molecules.

The results of these experiments indicate that the selective HDAC8 inhibitors described herein would have better toxicity profiles and would be better tolerated than pan HDAC inhibitors.

As shown in . Phospholipase C gamma 1 deficient Jurkat derivative J.gamma1 cells are resistant to compound 23 induced apoptosis but TCR signaling mutants are not

Jurkat WT and derivative see Table 6 cell lines were treated with 5 M compound 23 for 2 days and Annexin V positive cells measured by flow cytometry

As shown in . Phospholipase C inhibitor modulates compound 23 induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells but does not affect PLCg1 deficient cells. Jurkat and J.gamma1 cells treated with PLC inhibitor U73122 and inactive analog U73343 with or without compound 23 and apoptosis measured after 2 days.

As shown in . Cytochrome C translocation from mitochondria to cytosol following treatment with compound 23 in Jurkat but not in J.gamma1 cells. Jurkat and J gamma1 cells were treated with compound 23 PCI 24781 or FasL for 12 or 24 hours the mitochondrial and cytosolic including ER fractions separated using the Pierce Mitochondria Isolation kit and analyzed by Western blotting with anti Cyt C and anti Cyt C oxidase not shown .

Jurkat derivative J.gamma1 cell line PLCg1 deficient is resistant to apoptosis by compound 23 but T cell receptor signaling mutants are not. PLCg1 appears to play a prominent role in selective HDAC8 inhibitor induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Phospholipase inhibitor but not inactive analog blocks apoptosis by compound 23. Thapsigargin a calcium release agent enhances selective HDAC8 inhibitor induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells while BAPTA a calcium chelator causes increased resistance. Cytochrome C release from mitochodria after treatment with compound 23 likely due to Ca2 influx is blocked in J.gamma1 cells. Therefore Ca2 release contributes at least partially to the apoptotic mechanism.

Compounds described herein were examined for the ability to inhibit IL 1b secretion in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells PMBCs and THP 1 monocyte cells. Experimental methods for measuring the effects of HDAC inhibitors on IL 1b secretion is discussed in Carta et al. 2006 vol. 108 no. 5 1618 1626 .

Test compound and or vehicle is preincubated with human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocyte PBML 5 105 ml cells in AIM V medium pH 7.4 for 30 minutes at 37 C. Lipopolysaccharide LPS 25 ng ml is then added to stimulate the cells for another 16 hour incubation period in 5 CO2. IL 1b cytokine levels in the conditioned medium are then quantitated using a sandwich ELISA kit. Compounds are screened at 10 1 0.1 0.01 and 0.001 M. These same concentrations are concurrently applied to a separate group of treated cells and evaluated for possible compound induced cytotoxicity.

Compounds were also examined for effects on inhibition of IL 1b secretion in THP 1 monocyte cell lines. The results show that selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds reduce IL 1b secretion. Thus selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds offer the opportunity for treatment of IL 1b mediated diseases or conditions with reduced toxicity as compared to pan HDAC inhibitors .
