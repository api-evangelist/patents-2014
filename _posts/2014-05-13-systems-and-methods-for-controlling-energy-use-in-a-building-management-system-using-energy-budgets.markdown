title: Systems and methods for controlling energy use in a building management system using energy budgets
abstract: Systems and methods for limiting power consumption by a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) subsystem of a building are shown and described. A mathematical linear operator is found that transforms the unused or deferred cooling power usage of the HVAC system based on pre-determined temperature settings to a target cooling power usage. The mathematical operator is applied to the temperature settings to create a temperature setpoint trajectory expected to provide the target cooling power usage.

The entireties of U.S. application Ser. No. 13 396 514 and U.S. application Ser. No. 13 251 134 are incorporated by reference herein.

The present invention relates generally to the field of building management systems. The present invention more particularly relates to systems and methods for integrating a building management system with smart grid components and data.

In a smart grid the switching points in the grid as well as several other points distributed throughout the grid include microprocessor driven controls configured to automatically reconfigure the circuits and communicate bi directional information. The communicated information can be carried over the power distribution grid itself or other communication mediums e.g. wireless optical wired etc. .

A smart grid is a key element of a comprehensive strategy to increase energy reliability and efficiency reduce energy costs and lower greenhouse gas emissions. The large portion of smart grid R D efforts today are focused on creating the digital communications architecture and distribution management infrastructure connecting power plant and utility scale energy resources with distributed meters. During peak usage times demand limiting may be utilized to reduce the energy costs of operating a building s heating ventilation and air conditioning HVAC lighting elevator and other subsystems.

One embodiment of the invention relates to a process for controlling power consumption of a cooling system during a limited power period of a day. The process includes using a controller of the cooling system to observe cooling power use resulting from a temperature setpoint trajectory. The temperature setpoint trajectory may comprise a pre cooling period and a limited power period. The process further includes using a controller of the cooling system to calculate a deferred cooling power use resulting from a temperature setpoint trajectory of a first day. The deferred cooling power use may be identified by comparing the observed cooling power use to an expected cooling power use for a constant temperature setpoint during the limited power period. The process further includes finding a target deferred cooling power use. The process further includes finding a linear operator that transforms the deferred cooling power use observed during the limited power period to the target deferred cooling power use. The process further includes applying the linear operator to a changing temperature setpoint trajectory of the limited power period to create a temperature setpoint trajectory corresponding to the target cooling power use.

Another embodiment of the present invention relates to a controller of a HVAC system. The controller includes a processing circuit that is configured to observe cooling power use resulting from a temperature setpoint trajectory over a pre cooling period and a limited power period. The processing circuit is further configured to compute a deferred cooling power use resulting from a temperature setpoint trajectory. The deferred cooling power use may be identified by comparing the observed cooling power use to an expected cooling power use for a constant temperature setpoint during the limited power period. The processing circuit is further configured to compute a target deferred cooling power use. The processing circuit is further configured to compute a linear operator that transforms the deferred cooling power use observed during the limited power period to the target deferred cooling power use. The processing circuit is further configured to apply the linear operator to a changing temperature setpoint trajectory of the limited power period to create a temperature setpoint trajectory corresponding to the target cooling power use.

The present invention relates to a building management system configured to improve building efficiency to enable greater use of renewable energy sources and to provide more comfortable and productive buildings.

A building management system BMS is in general hardware and or software configured to control monitor and manage devices in or around a building or building area. BMS subsystems or devices can include heating ventilation and air conditioning HVAC subsystems or devices security subsystems or devices lighting subsystems or devices fire alerting subsystems or devices elevator subsystems or devices other devices that are capable of managing building functions or any combination thereof.

Referring now to a block diagram of a system including a smart building manager is shown according to an exemplary embodiment. Smart building manager is connected to a smart grid and a plurality of building subsystems . The building subsystems may include a building electrical subsystem an information communication technology ICT subsystem a security subsystem a HVAC subsystem a lighting subsystem a lift escalators subsystem and a fire safety subsystem . The building subsystems can include fewer additional or alternative subsystems. For example building subsystems may also or alternatively include a refrigeration subsystem an advertising or signage system subsystem a cooking subsystem a vending subsystem or a printer or copy service subsystem. Conventionally these systems are autonomous and managed by separate control systems. Embodiments of the smart building manager described herein are configured to achieve energy consumption and energy demand reductions by integrating the management of the building subsystems.

Each of building subsystems include any number of devices controllers and connections for completing their individual functions and control activities. For example HVAC subsystem may include a chiller a boiler any number of air handling units economizers field controllers supervisory controllers actuators temperature sensors or other devices for controlling the temperature within a building. As another example lighting subsystem may include any number of light fixtures ballasts lighting sensors dimmers or other devices configured to controllably adjust the amount of light provided to a building space. Security subsystem may include occupancy sensors video surveillance cameras digital video recorders video processing servers intrusion detection devices access control devices and servers or other security related devices.

In an exemplary embodiment the smart building manager is configured to include a communications interface to the smart grid outside the building an interface to disparate subsystems within a building e.g. HVAC lighting security lifts power distribution business etc. and an interface to applications network or local for allowing user control and the monitoring and adjustment of the smart building manager or subsystems . Enterprise control applications may be configured to provide subsystem spanning control to a graphical user interface GUI or to any number of enterprise level business applications e.g. accounting systems user identification systems etc. . Enterprise control applications may also or alternatively be configured to provide configuration GUIs for configuring the smart building manager . In yet other embodiments enterprise control applications can work with layers to optimize building performance e.g. efficiency energy use comfort or safety based on inputs received at the interface to the smart grid and the interface to building subsystems . In an exemplary embodiment smart building manager is integrated within a single computer e.g. one server one housing etc. . In various other exemplary embodiments the smart building manager can be distributed across multiple servers or computers e.g. that can exist in distributed locations .

Communications interfaces can be or include wired or wireless interfaces e.g. jacks antennas transmitters receivers transceivers wire terminals etc. for conducting data communications with e.g. smart grid energy providers and purchasers building subsystems or other external sources via a direct connection or a network connection e.g. an Internet connection a LAN WAN or WLAN connection etc. . For example communications interfaces can include an Ethernet card and port for sending and receiving data via an Ethernet based communications link or network. In another example communications interfaces can include a WiFi transceiver for communicating via a wireless communications network. In another example one or both of interfaces may include cellular or mobile phone communications transceivers. In one embodiment communications interface is a power line communications interface and communications interface is an Ethernet interface. In other embodiments both communications interface and communications interface are Ethernet interfaces or are the same Ethernet interface. Further while shows applications and as existing outside of smart building manager in some embodiments applications and may be hosted within smart building manager generally or memory device more particularly.

Referring further to the building subsystem integration layer is configured to manage communications between the rest of the smart building manager s components and the building subsystems. The building subsystem integration layer may also be configured to manage communications between building subsystems. The building subsystem integration layer may be configured to translate communications e.g. sensor data input signals output signals etc. across a plurality of multi vendor multi protocol systems. For example the building subsystem integration layer may be configured to integrate data from subsystems .

In the building subsystem integration layer is shown in greater detail to include a message format and content normalization component . The message format and content normalization component is configured to convert data messages for and from disparately protocolled devices or networks e.g. different building subsystems differently protocolled smart grid sources etc. . The message format and content normalization component is shown to include two subcomponents an application normalization component and a building subsystem normalization component . The application normalization component is a computer function object service or combination thereof configured to drive the conversion of communications for and from applications e.g. enterprise level applications shown in a computerized maintenance management system utility company applications via smart grid shown in etc. . The building subsystem normalization component is a computer function object service or combination thereof configured to drive the conversion of communications for and from building subsystems e.g. building subsystems shown in building subsystem controllers building devices security systems fire systems etc. . The application normalization component and the building subsystem normalization component are configured to accommodate multiple communications or data protocols. In some embodiments the application normalization component and the building subsystem normalization component are configured to conduct the conversion for each protocol based on information stored in modules e.g. a table a script in memory device shown in for each of systems or devices . The protocol modules may be for example schema maps or other descriptions of how a message for one protocol should be translated to a message for a second protocol. In some embodiments the modules may be plug in drivers that can be easily installed to or removed from a building subsystem integration layer e.g. via an executable installation routine by placing a file in an interfaces folder etc. during setup. For example modules may be vendor specific e.g. Johnson Controls Honeywell Siemens etc. standards based e.g. BACnet ANSI C12.19 Lon Works Modbus RIP SNMP SOAP web services HTML HTTP HTTPS XML XAML TFTP DHCP DNS SMTP SNTP etc. user built user selected and or user customized. In some embodiments the application normalization component or building subsystem normalization component are configured for compatibility with new modules or drivers e.g. user defined or provided by a vendor or third party . In such embodiments message format and content normalization component may advantageously be scaled for future applications or case specific requirements e.g. situations calling for the use of additional cyber security standards such as data encryption decryption by changing the active module set or by installing a new module.

Using message format and content normalization component the building subsystem integration layer can be configured to provide a service oriented architecture for providing cross subsystem control activities and cross subsystem applications. The message format and content normalization component can be configured to provide a relatively small number of straightforward interfaces e.g. application programming interfaces APIs or protocols e.g. open protocols unified protocols common protocols for use by layers shown in or external applications e.g. shown in and to hide such layers or applications from the complexities of the underlying subsystems and their particular data transport protocols data formats semantics interaction styles and the like. Configuration of the message format and content normalization component may occur automatically e.g. via a building subsystem and device discovery process via user configuration or by a combination of automated discovery and user configuration. User configuration may be driven by providing one or more graphical user interfaces or wizards to a user the graphical user interfaces allowing the user to map an attribute from one protocol to an attribute of another protocol. Configuration tool shown in may be configured to drive such an association process. The configuration tool may be served to clients local or remote via web services and or GUI engine both shown in . The configuration tool may be provided as a thin web client e.g. that primarily interfaces with web services or a thick client e.g. that only occasionally draws upon web services and or GUI engine . Configuration tool may be configured to use a W3C standard intended to harmonize semantic information from different systems to controllably define describe and store relationships between the data protocols e.g. define the modules . For example the W3C standard used may be the Web Ontology Language OWL . In some exemplary embodiments configuration tool may be configured to prepare the message format and content normalization component and device protocol modules thereof for machine level interoperability of data content.

Once the building subsystem integration layer is configured developers of applications may be provided with a software development kit to allow rapid development of applications compatible with the smart building manager e.g. with an application facing protocol or API of the building subsystem integration layer . Such an API or application facing protocol may be exposed at the enterprise integration layer shown in . In various exemplary embodiments the smart building manager including building subsystem integration layer includes the following features or advantages seamless in that heterogeneous applications and subsystems may be integrated without varying or affecting the behavior of the external facing interfaces or logic open in that it allows venders to develop products and applications by coding adapters e.g. modules shown in or features according to a well defined specification multi standard in that it supports subsystems that operate according to standards as well as proprietary protocols extensible in that it accommodates new applications and subsystems with little to no modification scalable in that it supports many applications and subsystems adaptable in that it allows for the addition or deletion of applications or subsystems without affecting system consistency user configurable in that it is adjustable to changes in the business environment business rules or business workflows and secure in that it protects information transferred through the integration channel. Additional details with respect to building subsystem integration layer are described below with respect to .

Referring further to the integrated control layer is configured to use the data input and or output of the building subsystem integration layer to make control decisions. Due to the subsystem integration provided by the building subsystem integration layer the integrated control layer can integrate control activities of the subsystems such that the subsystems behave as a single integrated supersystem. In an exemplary embodiment the integrated control layer includes control logic that uses inputs and outputs from a plurality of building subsystems to provide greater comfort and energy savings relative to the comfort and energy savings that separate subsystems could provide alone. For example information from a first building subsystem may be used to control a second building subsystem. By way of a more particular example when a building employee badges in at a parking garage a message may be sent from the parking subsystem to the building subsystem integration layer converted into an event recognized as a universal occupancy e.g. badge in event and provided to integrated control layer . Integrated control layer may include logic that turns on the lights in the building employee s office begins cooling the building employee s office in response to the anticipated occupancy and boots up the employee s computer. The decision to turn the devices on is made by integrated control layer and integrated control layer may cause proper on commands to be forwarded to the particular subsystems e.g. the lighting subsystem the IT subsystem the HVAC subsystem . The integrated control layer passes the on commands through building subsystem integration layer so that the messages are properly formatted or protocolled for receipt and action by the subsystems. As is illustrated in the integrated control layer is logically above the building subsystems and building subsystem controllers. The integrated control layer by having access to information from multiple systems is configured to use inputs from one or more building subsystems to make control decisions for control algorithms of other building subsystems. For example the badge in event described above can be used by the integrated control layer e.g. a control algorithm thereof to provide new setpoints to an HVAC control algorithm of the HVAC subsystem.

While conventional building subsystem controllers are only able to process inputs that are directly relevant to the performance of their own control loops the integrated control layer is configured to use an input from a first subsystem to make an energy saving control decision for a second subsystem. Results of these decisions can be communicated back to the building subsystem integration layer via for example the message format and content normalization component shown in . Therefore advantageously regardless of the particular HVAC system or systems connected to the smart building manager and due to the normalization at the building subsystem integration layer the integrated control layer s control algorithms can determine a control strategy using normalized temperature inputs and provide an output including a normalized setpoint temperature to the building subsystem integration layer. The building subsystem integration layer can translate the normalized setpoint temperature into a command specific to the building subsystem or controller for which the setpoint adjustment is intended. If multiple subsystems are utilized to complete the same function e.g. if multiple disparately protocolled HVAC subsystems are provided in different regions of a building the building subsystem integration layer can convert a command decision e.g. to lower the temperature setpoint by 2 degrees to multiple different commands for receipt and action by the multiple disparately protocolled HVAC subsystems. In this way functions of the integrated control layer may be executed using the capabilities of building subsystem integration layer . In an exemplary embodiment the integrated control layer is configured to conduct the primary monitoring of system and subsystem statuses and interrelationships for the building. Such monitoring can cross the major energy consuming subsystems of a building to allow for cross subsystem energy savings to be achieved e.g. by the demand response layer .

The integrated control layer is shown to be logically below the demand response layer . The integrated control layer is configured to enhance the effectiveness of the demand response layer by enabling building subsystems and their respective control loops to be controlled in coordination with the demand response layer . This configuration may advantageously provide much less disruptive demand response behavior than conventional systems. For example the integrated control layer may be configured to assure that a demand response driven upward adjustment to the setpoint for chilled water temperature or another component that directly or indirectly affects temperature does not result in an increase in fan energy or other energy used to cool a space that would result in greater total building energy use than was saved at the chiller. The integrated control layer may also be configured to provide feedback to the demand response layer so that the demand response layer may check that constraints e.g. temperature lighting levels etc. are properly maintained even while demanded load shedding is in progress. The constraints may also include setpoint or sensed boundaries relating to safety equipment operating limits and performance comfort fire codes electrical codes energy codes and the like. The integrated control layer is also logically below the fault detection and diagnostics FDD layer and the automated measurement and validation layer . The integrated control layer may be configured to provide calculated inputs e.g. aggregations to these higher levels based on outputs from more than one building subsystem.

Control activities that may be completed by the integrated control layer e.g. software modules or control algorithms thereof include occupancy based control activities. Security systems such as radio frequency location systems RFLS access control systems and video surveillance systems can provide detailed occupancy information to the integrated control layer and other building subsystems via the smart building manager and more particularly via the building subsystem integration layer . Integration of an access control subsystem and a security subsystem for a building may provide detailed occupancy data for consumption by the integrated control layer e.g. beyond binary occupied or unoccupied data available to some conventional HVAC systems that rely on for example a motion sensor . For example the exact number of occupants in the building or building zone floor conference room etc. may be provided to the integrated control layer or aggregated by the integrated control layer using inputs from a plurality of subsystems. The exact number of occupants in the building can be used by the integrated control layer to determine and command appropriate adjustments for building subsystems such as HVAC subsystem or lighting subsystem . Integrated control layer may be configured to use the number of occupants for example to determine how many of the available elevators to activate in a building. If the building is only 20 occupied the integrated control layer for example may be configured to power down 80 of the available elevators for energy savings. Further occupancy data may be associated with individual workspaces e.g. cubicles offices desks workstations etc. and if a workspace is determined to be unoccupied by the integrated control layer a control algorithm of the integrated control layer may allow for the energy using devices serving the workspace to be turned off or commanded to enter a low power mode. For example workspace plug loads task lighting computers and even phone circuits may be affected based on a determination by the integrated control layer that the employee associated with the workspace is on vacation e.g. using data inputs received from a human resources subsystem . Significant electrical loads may be shed by the integrated control layer including for example heating and humidification loads cooling and dehumidification loads ventilation and fan loads electric lighting and plug loads e.g. with secondary thermal loads electric elevator loads and the like. The integrated control layer may further be configured to integrate an HVAC subsystem or a lighting subsystem with sunlight shading devices or other smart window technologies. Natural day lighting can significantly offset lighting loads but for optimal comfort may be controlled by the integrated control layer to prevent glare or over lighting. Conversely shading devices and smart windows may also be controlled by the integrated control layer to calculably reduce solar heat gains in a building space which can have a significant impact on cooling loads. Using feedback from sensors in the space and with knowledge of the HVAC control strategy the integrated control layer may further be configured to control the transmission of infrared radiation into the building minimizing thermal transmission when the HVAC subsystem is cooling and maximizing thermal transmission when the HVAC subsystem is heating. As a further example of an occupancy based control strategy that may be implemented by the integrated control layer inputs from a video security subsystem may be analyzed by a control algorithm of the integrated control layer to make a determination regarding occupancy of a building space. Using the determination the control algorithm may turn off the lights adjust HVAC set points power down ICT devices serving the space reduce ventilation and the like enabling energy savings with an acceptable loss of comfort to occupants of the building space.

Referring now to a detailed diagram of a portion of smart building manager is shown according to an exemplary embodiment. In particular illustrates a detailed embodiment of integrated control layer . Configuration tools can allow a user to define e.g. via graphical user interfaces via prompt driven wizards etc. how the integrated control layer should react to changing conditions in the building subsystems . In an exemplary embodiment configuration tools allow a user to build and store condition response scenarios that can cross multiple building subsystems and multiple enterprise control applications e.g. work order management system applications entity resource planning ERP applications etc. .

Building subsystems external sources such as smart grid and internal layers such as demand response layer can regularly generate events e.g. messages alarms changed values etc. and provide the events to integrated control layer or another layer configured to handle the particular event. For example demand response DR events e.g. a change in real time energy pricing may be provided to smart building manager as Open Automated Demand Response OpenADR messages a protocol developed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories . The DR messages may be received by OpenADR adapter which may be a part of enterprise application layer shown in . The OpenADR adapter may be configured to convert the OpenADR message into a DR event configured to be understood e.g. parsed interpreted processed etc. by demand response layer . The DR event may be formatted and transmitted according to or via a service bus for the smart building manager .

Service bus adapter may be configured to trap or otherwise receive the DR event on the service bus and forward the DR event on to demand response layer . Service bus adapter may be configured to queue mediate or otherwise manage demand response messages for demand response layer . Once a DR event is received by demand response layer logic thereof can generate a control trigger in response to processing the DR event. The integrated control engine of integrated control layer is configured to parse the received control trigger to determine if a control strategy exists in control strategy database that corresponds to the received control trigger. If a control strategy exists integrated control engine executes the stored control strategy for the control trigger. In some cases the output of the integrated control engine will be an apply policy message for business rules engine to process. Business rules engine may process an apply policy message by looking up the policy in business rules database . A policy in business rules database may take the form of a set of action commands for sending to building subsystems . The set of action commands may include ordering or scripting for conducting the action commands at the correct timing ordering or with other particular parameters. When business rules engine processes the set of action commands therefore it can control the ordering scripting and other parameters of action commands transmitted to the building subsystems .

Action commands may be commands for relatively direct consumption by building subsystems commands for other applications to process or relatively abstract cross subsystem commands. Commands for relatively direct consumption by building subsystems can be passed through service bus adapter to service bus and to a subsystem adapter for providing to a building subsystem in a format particular to the building subsystem. Commands for other applications to process may include commands for a user interface application to request feedback from a user a command to generate a work order via a computerized maintenance management system CMMS application a command to generate a change in an ERP application or other application level commands.

More abstract cross subsystem commands may be passed to a semantic mediator which performs the task of translating those actions to the specific commands required by the various building subsystems . For example a policy might contain an abstract action to set lighting zone X to maximum light. The semantic mediator may translate this action to a first command such as set level to 100 for lighting object O in controller C and a second command of set lights to on in controller Z zone id no 3141593. In this example both lighting object O in controller C and zone id no 3141593 in controller Z may affect lighting in zone X. Controller C may be a dimming controller for accent lighting while controller Z may be a non dimming controller for the primary lighting in the room. The semantic mediator is configured to determine the controllers that relate to zone X using ontology database . Ontology database stores a representation or representations of relationships the ontology between building spaces and subsystem elements and subsystems elements and concepts of the integrated building supersystem. Using the ontology stored in ontology database the semantic mediator can also determine that controller C is dimming and requires a numerical percentage parameter while controller Z is not dimming and requires only an on or off command. Configuration tool can allow a user to build the ontology of ontology database by establishing relationships between subsystems building spaces input output points or other concepts objects of the building subsystems and the building space.

Events other than those received via OpenADR adapter demand response layer or any other specific event handing mechanism can be trapped by subsystem adapter a part of building integration subsystem layer and provided to a general event manager via service bus and a service bus adapter. By the time an event from a building subsystem is received by event manager it may have been converted into a unified event i.e. common event standardized event etc. by subsystem adapter and or other components of building subsystem integration layer such as semantic mediator . The event manager can utilize an event logic DB to lookup control triggers control trigger scripts or control trigger sequences based on received unified events. Event manager can provide control triggers to integrated control engine as described above with respect to demand response layer . As events are received they may be archived in event history by event manager . Similarly demand response layer can store DR events in DR history . One or both of event manager and demand response layer may be configured to wait until multi event conditions are met e.g. by processing data in history as new events are received . For example demand response layer may include logic that does not act to reduce energy loads until a series of two sequential energy price increases are received. In an exemplary embodiment event manager may be configured to receive time events e.g. from a calendaring system . Different time events can be associated with different triggers in event logic database .

In an exemplary embodiment the configuration tools can be used to build event conditions or trigger conditions in event logic or control strategy database . For example the configuration tools can provide the user with the ability to combine data e.g. from subsystems from event histories using a variety of conditional logic. In varying exemplary embodiments the conditional logic can range from simple logical operators between conditions e.g. AND OR XOR etc. to pseudo code constructs or complex programming language functions allowing for more complex interactions conditional statements loops etc. . The configuration tools can present user interfaces for building such conditional logic. The user interfaces may allow users to define policies and responses graphically. In some embodiments the user interfaces may allow a user to select a pre stored or pre constructed policy and adapt it or enable it for use with their system.

Referring still to in some embodiments integrated control layer generally and integrated control engine can operate as a service that can be used by higher level layers of smart building manager enterprise applications or subsystem logic whenever a policy or sequence of actions based on the occurrence of a condition is to be performed. In such embodiments control operations do not need to be reprogrammed applications or logic can rely on the integrated control layer to receive an event and to execute the related subsystem functions. For example demand response layer fault detection and diagnostics layer shown in enterprise integration and applications may all utilize a shared control strategy and integrated control engine in initiate response sequences to events.

In some exemplary embodiments the DR layer may include a control module configured to actively initiate control actions e.g. automatically changing setpoints which minimize energy costs based on one or more inputs representative of or based on demand e.g. price a curtailment signal a demand level etc. . The DR layer may further include or draw upon one or more DR policy definitions e.g. databases XML files etc. . The policy definitions may be edited or adjusted by a user e.g. via a graphical user interface so that the control actions initiated in response to demand inputs may be tailored for the user s application desired comfort level particular building equipment or based on other concerns. For example the DR policy definitions can specify which equipment may be turned on or off in response to particular demand inputs how long a system or piece of equipment should be turned off what setpoints can be changed what the allowable set point adjustment range is how long to hold a high demand setpoint before returning to a normally scheduled setpoint how close to approach capacity limits which equipment modes to utilize the energy transfer rates e.g. the maximum rate an alarm rate other rate boundary information etc. into and out of energy storage devices e.g. thermal storage tanks battery banks etc. and when to dispatch on site generation of energy e.g. via fuel cells a motor generator set etc. . One or more of the policies and control activities may be located within control strategy database or business rules database . Further as described above with reference to some of the DR responses to events may be processed and completed by integrated control layer with or without further inputs or processing by DR layer .

A plurality of market based DR inputs and reliability based DR inputs may be configured e.g. via the DR policy definitions or other system configuration mechanisms for use by the DR layer . The smart building manager may be configured e.g. self configured manually configured configured via DR policy definitions etc. to select deselect or differently weigh varying inputs in the DR layer s calculation or execution of control strategies based on the inputs. DR layer may automatically and or via the user configuration calculate outputs or control strategies based on a balance of minimizing energy cost and maximizing comfort. Such balance may be adjusted e.g. graphically via rule sliders etc. by users of the smart building manager via a configuration utility or administration GUI.

The DR layer may be configured to receive inputs from other layers e.g. the building subsystem integration layer the integrated control layer etc. . The inputs received from other layers may include environmental or sensor inputs such as temperature carbon dioxide levels relative humidity levels air quality sensor outputs occupancy sensor outputs room schedules and the like. The inputs may also include inputs such as electrical use e.g. expressed in kWh thermal load measurements pricing information projected pricing smoothed pricing curtailment signals from utilities and the like from inside the system from the smart grid or from other remote sources.

Some embodiments of the DR layer may utilize industry standard open protocols or emerging National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST standards to receive real time pricing RTP or curtailment signals from utilities or power retailers. In other embodiments proprietary protocols or other standards may be utilized. As mentioned above in some exemplary embodiments the DR layer is configured to use the OpenADR protocol to receive curtailment signals or RTP data from utilities other independent system operators ISOs or other smart grid sources. The DR layer or another layer e.g. the enterprise integration layer that serves the DR layer may be configured to use one or more security schemes or standards such as the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards OASIS Web Service Security Standards to provide for secure communications to from the DR layer and the smart grid e.g. a utility company s data communications network . If the utility does not use a standard protocol e.g. the OpenADR protocol the DR layer the enterprise integration layer or the building subsystem integration layer may be configured to translate the utility s protocol into a format for use by the utility. The DR layer may be configured to bi directionally communicate with the smart grid or energy providers and purchasers e.g. a utility an energy retailer a group of utilities an energy broker etc. to exchange price information demand information curtailable load calculations e.g. the amount of load calculated by the DR layer to be able to be shed without exceeding parameters defined by the system or user load profile forecasts and the like. DR layer or an enterprise application in communication with the DR layer may be configured to continuously monitor pricing data provided by utilities ISOs across the nation to parse the useful information from the monitored data and to display the useful information to a user to or send the information to other systems or layers e.g. integrated control layer .

The DR layer may be configured to include one or more adjustable control algorithms in addition to or as an alternative from allowing the user creation of DR profiles. For example one or more control algorithms may be automatically adjusted by the DR layer using dynamic programming or model predictive control modules. In one embodiment business rules engine is configured to respond to a DR event by adjusting a control algorithm or selecting a different control algorithm to use e.g. for a lighting system for an HVAC system for a combination of multiple building subsystems etc. .

The smart building manager e.g. using the demand response layer can be configured to automatically or with the help of a user manage energy spend. The smart building manager with input from the user or operating using pre configured business rules shown in may be configured to accept time of use pricing signals or information from a smart grid e.g. an energy provider a smart meter etc. and using its knowledge of historical building system data control algorithms calendar information and or weather information received from a remote source may be configured to conduct automatic cost forecasting. The smart building manager e.g. the demand response layer may automatically or with user approval take specific load shedding actions or control algorithm changes in response to different cost forecasts.

The smart building manager may also be configured to monitor and control energy storage systems e.g. thermal electrical etc. and distributed generation systems e.g. a solar array for the building etc. . The smart building manager or DR layer may also be configured to model utility rates to make decisions for the system. All of the aforementioned processing activities or inputs may be used by the smart building manager and more particularly a demand response layer thereof to limit cap profit from or otherwise manage the building or campus s energy spend. For example using time of use pricing information for an upcoming hour that indicates an unusually high price per kilowatt hour the system may use its control of a plurality of building systems to limit cost without too drastically impacting occupant comfort. To make such a decision and to conduct such activity the smart building manager may use data such as a relatively high load forecast for a building and information that energy storage levels or distributed energy levels are low. The smart building manager may accordingly adjust or select a control strategy to reduce ventilation levels provided to unoccupied areas reduce server load raise a cooling setpoint throughout the building reserve stored power for use during the expensive period of time dim lights in occupied areas turn off lights in unoccupied areas and the like.

The smart building manager may provide yet other services to improve building or grid performance. For example the smart building manager may provide for expanded user driven load control allowing a building manager to shed loads at a high level of system device granularity . The smart building manager may also monitor and control power switching equipment to route power to from the most efficient sources or destinations. The smart building manager may communicate to the power switching equipment within the building or campus to conduct smart voltage regulation. For example in the event of a brownout the smart building manager may prioritize branches of a building s internal power grid tightly regulating and ensuring voltage to high priority equipment e.g. communications equipment data center equipment cooling equipment for a clean room or chemical factory etc. while allowing voltage to lower priority equipment to dip or be cut off by the smart grid e.g. the power provider . The smart building manager or the DR layer may plan these activities or proactively begin load shedding based on grid services capacity forecasting conducted by a source on the smart grid or by a local algorithm e.g. an algorithm of the demand response layer . The smart building manager or the DR layer may further include control logic for purchasing energy selling energy or otherwise participating in a real time or near real time energy market or auction. For example if energy is predicted to be expensive during a time when the DR layer determines it can shed extra load or perhaps even enter a net positive energy state using energy generated by solar arrays or other energy sources of the building or campus the DR layer may offer units of energy during that period for sale back to the smart grid e.g. directly to the utility to another purchaser in exchange for carbon credits etc. .

In some exemplary embodiments the DR layer may also be configured to support a Grid Aware plug in hybrid electric vehicle PHEV electric vehicle charging system instead of or in addition to having the charging system in the vehicles be grid aware. For example in buildings that have vehicle charging stations e.g. terminals in a parking lot for charging an electric or hybrid vehicle the DR layer can decide when to charge the vehicles e.g. when to enable the charging stations when to switch a relay providing power to the charging stations etc. based upon time real time pricing RTP information from the smart grid or other pricing demand or curtailment information from the smart grid. In other embodiments each vehicle owner could set a policy that is communicated to the charging station and back to the DR layer via wired or wireless communications that the DR layer could be instructed to follow. The policy information could be provided to the DR layer via an enterprise application a vehicle information system or a personal portal e.g. a web site vehicle owner s are able to access to input for example at what price they would like to enable charging . The DR layer could then activate the PHEV charging station based upon that policy unless a curtailment event is expected or occurs or unless the DR layer otherwise determines that charging should not occur e.g. decides that electrical storage should be conducted instead to help with upcoming anticipated peak demand . When such a decision is made the DR layer may pre charge the vehicle or suspend charge to the vehicle e.g. via a data command to the charging station . Vehicle charging may be restricted or turned off by the smart building manager during periods of high energy use or expensive energy. Further during such periods the smart building manager or the DR layer may be configured to cause energy to be drawn from plugged in connected vehicles to supplement or to provide back up power to grid energy.

Using the real time or near real time detailed information regarding energy use in the building the smart building manager may maintain a greenhouse gas inventory forecast renewable energy use surpluses deficits and generation and facilitate emission allocation emission trading and the like. Due to the detailed and real time or near real time nature of such calculations the smart building manager may include or be coupled to a micro transaction emission trading platform.

The DR layer may further be configured to facilitate the storage of on site electrical or thermal storage and to controllably shift electrical loads from peak to off peak times using the stored electrical or thermal storage. The DR layer may be configured to significantly shed loads during peak hours if for example high price or contracted curtailment signals are received using the stored electrical or thermal storage and without significantly affecting building operation or comfort. The DR layer may be configured to use a building pre cooling algorithm in the night or morning. The DR layer may be configured to rely on calculated thermal storage characteristics for the building in order to reduce peak demand for cooling e.g. by relying on the pre cooling . Further the DR layer may be configured to use inputs such as utility rates type of cooling equipment occupancy schedule building construction climate conditions upcoming weather events and the like to make control decisions e.g. the extent to which to pre cool etc. .

The AM V layer may further be configured to verify that control strategies commanded by for example the integrated control layer or the DR layer are working properly. Further the AM V layer may be configured to verify that a building has fulfilled curtailment contract obligations. The AM V layer may further be configured as an independent verification source for the energy supply company utility . One concern of the utility is that a conventional smart meter may be compromised to report less energy or energy consumed at the wrong time . The AM V layer can be used to audit smart meter data or other data used by the utility by measuring energy consumption directly from the building subsystems or knowledge of building subsystem usage and comparing the measurement or knowledge to the metered consumption data. If there is a discrepancy the AM V layer may be configured to report the discrepancy directly to the utility. Because the AM V layer may be continuously operational and automated e.g. not based on a monthly or quarterly calculation the AM V layer may be configured to provide verification of impact e.g. of demand signals on a granular scale e.g. hourly daily weekly etc. . For example the AM V layer may be configured to support the validation of very short curtailment contracts e.g. drop X kW h over 20 minutes starting at 2 00 pm acted upon by the DR layer . The DR layer may track meter data to create a subhourly baseline model against which to measure load reductions. The model may be based on average load during a period of hours prior to the curtailment event during the five prior uncontrolled days or as specified by other contract requirements from a utility or curtailment service provider e.g. broker . The calculations made by the AM V layer may be based on building system energy models and may be driven by a combination of stipulated and measured input parameters to estimate calculate apportion and or plan for load reductions resulting from the DR control activities.

The AM V layer may yet further be configured to calculate energy savings and peak demand reductions in accordance with standards protocols or best practices for enterprise accounting and reporting on greenhouse gas GHG emissions. An application may access data provided or calculated by the AM V layer to provide for web based graphical user interfaces or reports. The data underlying the GUIs or reports may be checked by the AM V layer according to for example the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting Standard and the GHG Protocol for Project Accounting. The AM V layer preferably consolidates data from all the potential sources of GHG emissions at a building or campus and calculates carbon credits energy savings in dollars or any other currency or unit of measure makes adjustments to the calculations or outputs based on any numbers of standards or methods and creates detailed accountings or inventories of GHG emissions or emission reductions for each building. Such calculations and outputs may allow the AM V layer to communicate with electronic trading platforms contract partners or other third parties in real time or near real time to facilitate for example carbon offset trading and the like.

The AM V Layer may be further configured to become a smart electric meter a or substitute for conventional electric meters. One reason the adoption rate of the Smart Electric Grid has conventionally been low is that the entire stock of installed electric meters needs to be replaced so that the meters will support Real Time Pricing RTP of energy and other data communications features. The AM V layer can collect interval based electric meter data and store the data within the system. The AM V layer can also communicate with the utility to retrieve or otherwise receive Real Time Pricing RTP signals or other pricing information and associate the prices with the meter data. The utility can query this information from the smart building manager e.g. the AM V layer the DR layer at the end of a billing period and charge the customer using a RTP tariff or another mechanism. In this manner the AM V layer can be used as a Smart Electric Meter .

When the AM V layer is used in conjunction with the DR layer building subsystem integration layer and enterprise integration layer the smart building manager can be configured as an energy service portal ESP . As an ESP the smart building manager may communicably or functionally connect the smart grid e.g. energy supply company utility ISO broker etc. network to the metering and energy management devices in a building e.g. devices built into appliances such as dishwashers or other smart appliances . In other words the smart building manager may be configured to route messages to and from other data aware e.g. Real Time Pricing RTP aware curtailment signal aware pricing aware etc. devices and the energy supply company. In this configuration building subsystems that are not RTP aware will be managed by the DR layer while devices that are RTP aware can get signals directly from the utility. For example if a vehicle e.g. PHEV is programmed to charge only when the price of electricity is below 0.1 kWh the PHEV can query the utility through the smart building manager and charge independently from the DR layer .

The enterprise integration layer shown in or is configured to serve clients or local applications with information and services to support a variety of enterprise level applications. The enterprise integration layer may be configured to communicate in real time or near real time with the smart grid and or energy providers and purchasers . More particularly in some embodiments the enterprise integration layer may communicate with smart meters automated meter interfaces with utilities carbon emission tracking and accounting systems energy reporting systems a building occupant interface and traditional enterprise productivity applications e.g. maintenance management systems financial systems workplace and supply chain management systems etc. . The enterprise integration layer may be configured to use protocols and methods as described above with respect to other layers or otherwise.

As indicated above the enterprise integration layer shown in may be configured to exchange information with a building occupant interface application. In other exemplary embodiments the enterprise integration layer serves the building occupant interface application to clients connecting to the enterprise integration layer web services and or GUI engine . In yet other embodiments web services may utilize GUI engine for graphics rendering resources and enterprise integration layer for data relating to the building occupant interface in order to provide the building occupant interface to client applications.

Referring again to the smart building manager may be configured to provide drivers for BACnet LON N2 Modbus OPC OBIX MIG SMTP XML Web services and various other wireless communications protocols including Zigbee. These drivers may be implemented within or used by the service bus adapters or subsystem adapters. The service bus for the smart building manager may be configured to communicate using any number of smart grid communications standards. Such standards may be utilized for intra manager communication as well as communication with a smart grid component e.g. utility company smart meter etc. . For example the smart building manager may be configured to use the ANSI C12.22 C12.19 protocol for some internal communications e.g. DR events as well as for communications with the smart grid. The service bus adapters and subsystem adapters convert received messages into a normalized messaging format for use on the service bus. In an exemplary embodiment the service bus is flexible making use of IT centric message queuing technologies e.g. Open AMQ MSMQ and WebSphere MQ to assure reliability security scalability and performance. Service bus adapters enable layers and applications to communicate among one another and or to the various in building or external systems e.g. via subsystem adapters . Stored communications rules may be used by the service bus adapters subsystem adapters or other components of the system to catch or correct communications failures. Communications and action failure rules may also be configured for use by the action layers of the system. For example the DR layer can check for whether an action requested or commanded by the DR layer has completed. If not the DR layer can take a different action or a corrective action e.g. turn off an alternate load adjust additional setpoints trigger a focused FDD activity etc. to ensure that DR needs are met. The smart building manager can also determine if someone has provided a DR override command to the system and take corrective action if available. If corrective action is unavailable an appropriate message or warning may be sent to a DR partner e.g. a utility co. an energy purchaser via the smart grid etc. .

The smart building manager may reside on e.g. be connected to an IP Ethernet network utilizing standard network infrastructure protocols and applications e.g. DNS DHCP SNTP SNMP Active Directory etc. and can also be secured using IT security best practices for those standard network infrastructure protocols and applications. For example in some embodiments the smart building manager may include or be installed behind infrastructure software or hardware such as firewalls or switches. Further configurations in the smart building manager can be used by the system to adjust the level of security of the smart building manager . For example the smart building manager or particular components thereof can be configured to allow its middle layers or other components to communicate only with each other to communicate with a LAN WAN or Internet to communicate with select devices having a building service or to restrict communications with any of the above mentioned layers components data sources networks or devices. The smart building manager may be configured to support a tiered network architecture approach to communications which may provide for some measure of security. Outward facing components are placed in a less secure tier of the network to act as a point of entry to from the smart building manager . These outward facing components are minimized e.g. a web server receives and handles all requests from client applications which limits the number of ways the system can be accessed and provides an indirect communications route between external devices applications and networks and the internal layers or modules of the smart building manager . For example behind the outward facing first tier may lie a more secure tier of the network that requires for authentication and authorization to occur at the first tier before functions of the more secure tier are accessed. The smart building manager may be configured to include firewalls between such tiers or to define such tiers to protect databases or core components of the system from direct unauthorized access from outside networks.

In addition to including or implementing infrastructure type security measures as the type disclosed above the smart building manager may be configured to include a communications security module configured to provide network message security between the smart building manager and an outside device or application. For example if SOAP messaging over HTTP is used for communication at the enterprise integration layer the SOAP messages may be concatenated to include an RC2 encrypted header containing authentication credentials. The authentication credentials may be checked by the receiving device e.g. the smart building manager the end application or device etc. . In some embodiments the encrypted header may also contain information e.g. bits configured to identify whether the message was tampered with during transmission has been spoofed or is being replayed by an attacker. If a message does not conform to an expected format or if any part of the authentication fails the smart building manager may be configured to reject the message and any other unauthorized commands to the system. In some embodiments that use HTTP messages between the application and the smart building manager the smart building manager may be configured to provide SSL for message content security encryption and or Forms authentication for message authentication.

The smart building manager may yet further include an access security module that requires any application to be authenticated with user credentials prior to logging into the system. The access security module may be configured to complete a secure authentication challenge accomplished via a public or private key exchange e.g. RSA keys of a session key e.g. an RC2 key after a login with user credentials. The session key is used to encrypt the user credentials for the authentication challenge. After the authentication challenge the session key is used to encrypt the security header of the messages. Once authenticated user actions within the system are restricted by action based authorizations and can be limited. For example a user may be able to command and control HVAC points but may not be able to command and control Fire and Security points. Furthermore actions of a user within the smart building manager are written to memory via an audit trail engine providing a record of the actions that were taken. The database component of the smart building manager e.g. for storing device information DR profiles configuration data pricing information or other data mentioned herein or otherwise can be accessible via an SQL server that is a part of the building management server or located remotely from the smart building manager . For example the database server component of the smart building manager may be physically separated from other smart building manager components and located in a more secure tier of the network e.g. behind another firewall . The smart building manager may use SQL authentication for secure access to one or more of the aforementioned databases. Furthermore in an exemplary embodiment the smart building manager can be configured to support the use of non default instances of SQL and a non default TCP port for SQL. The operating system of the smart building manager may be a Windows based operating system.

Each smart building manager may provide its own security and is not reliant on a central server to provide the security. Further the same robustness of the smart building manager that provides the ability to incorporate new building subsystem communications standards modules drivers and the like also allows it to incorporate new and changing security standards e.g. for each module at a higher level etc. .

The smart building manager shown in the Figures may be configured to support multi campus or multi building energy management services. Each of a plurality of campuses can include a smart building manager configured to manage the building IT and energy resources of each campus. In such an example the building subsystems shown e.g in may be a collection of building subsystems for multiple buildings in a campus. The smart building manager may be configured to bi directionally communicate with on site power generation systems e.g. distributed power sources related services solar arrays fuel cell arrays diesel generators combined heat and power CHP systems etc. plug in hybrid electric vehicle PHEV systems and energy storage systems e.g. stationary energy storage thermal energy storage etc. . Data inputs from such sources may be used by the demand and response layer of the smart building manager to make demand or response decisions and to provide other ancillary services to a connected smart grid e.g. utility smart meter connected to a utility etc. in real time or near real time. For example the smart building manager may communicate with smart meters associated with an energy utility and directly or indirectly with independent systems operators ISOs which may be regional power providers. Using these communications and its inputs from devices of the campus the smart building manager e.g. the demand response layer is configured to engage in peak shaving load shedding or load balancing programs which provide financial incentives for reducing power draw during certain days or times of day. The demand response layer or other control algorithms of the smart building manager e.g. control algorithms of the integrated control layer may be configured to use weather forecast information to make setpoint or load shedding decisions e.g. so that comfort of buildings in the campus is not compromised . The smart building manager may be configured to use energy pricing information campus energy use information or other information to optimize business transactions e.g. the purchase of energy from the smart grid the sale of energy to the smart grid the purchase or sale of carbon credits with energy providers and purchasers etc. . The smart building manager is configured to use the decisions and processing of the demand response layer to affect control algorithms of the integrated control layer.

While is shown as a tightly coupled smart building manager in some embodiments the processing circuit of including the layers modules thereof may be distributed to different servers that together form the smart building manager having the control features described herein. In embodiments where the smart building manager is controlling an entire campus or set of campuses one or more smart building managers may be layered to effect hierarchical control activities. For example an enterprise level smart building manager may provide overall DR strategy decisions to a plurality of lower level smart building managers that process the strategy decisions e.g. using the framework shown in to effect change at an individual campus or building. By way of further example the integrated control layer and the building system integration layer may be replicated for each building and stored within lower level smart building servers while a single enterprise level smart building manager may provide a single higher level layer such the DR layer. Such a DR layer can execute a campus wide DR strategy by passing appropriate DR events to the separate lower level smart building mangers having integrated control layers and building system integration layers. Higher level servers may provide software interfaces APIs to the one or more lower level servers so that the one or more lower level servers can request information from the higher level server provide commands to the higher level server or otherwise communicate with the layers or data of the higher level server. The reverse is also true APIs or other software interfaces of the lower level servers may be exposed for consumption by the higher level server. The software interfaces may be web services interfaces relational database connections or otherwise.

As noted previously the DR layer may be configured to use a building pre cooling algorithm in the night or morning and rely on the thermal storage characteristics of the building itself i.e. storing energy in the thermal mass of the building to reduce peak demand for cooling. In many regions the cost of receiving electrical power from an energy provider depends not only on the actual consumption of power but also on the building s peak demand during a particular time period. That is the cost contains both an energy charge price per kWh and a demand charge price per kW . In general a building s peak demand corresponds to the maximum amount of power used by the building at any given time during a specified time period. For example the total load on the power grid may be higher during certain times of the day. In such a case the energy provider may charge a higher price for electricity during these times or demand other taxes or surcharges based on the user s peak demand.

The DR layer may employ a demand limiting approach to flatten a building s demand profile thus lowering its peak demand. This translates into cost savings for the operator of the building and also allows the energy provider to better predict overall demand for the smart grid. In some cases power usage by certain devices in the building may be limited during a demand limiting period as part of a demand limiting strategy. In the context of HVAC and other building subsystems it is advantageous for a demand limiting strategy to stop short of making habitation of the building uncomfortable. For example a smart building manager having a demand limiting feature may constrain temperature inside of the building to a particular range during the demand limiting period in order to ensure that the temperature stays within a specified comfort region.

Referring now to a process for controlling power consumption of a cooling system of a building is illustrated according to an exemplary embodiment. The process uses a linear system to determine a setpoint trajectory to apply on the next demand limiting day. Where the setpoint trajectory is the series of temperature setpoints during the day the process involves setting the setpoint trajectory such that it is estimated to minimize cooling cost during the demand limiting period. Once the setpoint trajectory is set in some embodiments it is not adjusted throughout the day. Rather in such embodiments open loop control is being used. Even in many of the open loop embodiments however the temperature may be constrained from floating or moving too high.

The process illustrated in begins with conducting at least one training day. Conducting the training day includes using a predetermined setpoint trajectory to cool the system. The predetermined setpoint trajectory may look like the trajectory shown in including a pre cooling period and a demand limiting period. shows the heat transfer rate or power output dot over Q for the day that results from the predetermined setpoint trajectory. The pre cooling period is used so that the period of greatest energy use occurs prior to the demand limiting period. When the temperature setpoint is low as during the pre cooling period the greatest amount of energy use occurs . In the demand limiting period when energy may be expensive the temperature setpoint in the building is increased. Thus during the demand limiting period the temperature is allowed to rise. An optimal setpoint trajectory may result in the actual temperature reaching a maximum for comfort reasons just as the demand limiting period ends refraining from allowing the temperature to become uncomfortable while refraining from cooling more than is necessary. In this discussion the heat transfer rate or power output is variously referred to as the power use or cooling power use. Limited power period and demand limiting period are used interchangeably.

The use of a linear operator to find an optimal setpoint trajectory relies on the linear system principle that in general if an input output pair of a linear time invariant system is known then response of the system to a transformed version of the input can be predicted by performing the same transformation to the output.

To find the optimum setpoint trajectory it is necessary to find a linear operator that when applied to dot over Q deferred power use during the demand limiting period mathematically transforms dot over Q into some objectively optimal deferred power trajectory dot over Q i.e. a deferred power trajectory that will result in minimizing the cost of electricity during the demand limiting period . Once the linear operator is found then the same linear operator can be applied to the changing temperature setpoint T during the demand limiting period. In other words once is found such that dot over Q dot over Q is applied to Tto achieve T. T is the next day s changing setpoint trajectory during the demand limiting period. The superscript indicates the next day. T can be added to T the constant pre cooling temperature setpoint trajectory to obtain a full day s temperature setpoint trajectory i.e. T T T . Applying the full day s temperature setpoint trajectory results in total energy usage for the next day dot over Q equal to the sum of the cooling power use during the pre cooling period dot over Q and the target deferred cooling power use during the demand limiting period dot over Q i.e. Q dot over Q dot over Q . Q may result in minimal electric costs during the demand limiting period if the objective power is chosen correctly.

The process is illustrated in according to an exemplary embodiment. On the training day the temperature setpoint trajectory comprises a pre cooling period and a limited power period. The training day may be one or more past days. The cooling power use is observed and the deferred power use dot over Q during the training day s limited power period is calculated step . Then the target deferred power use for the next day dot over Q is determined step . Next a liner operator is found where linear operator mathematically transforms the deferred power use during the training day s limited power period dot over Q to the target deferred power use for the next day dot over Q step . That condition is mathematically represented by dot over Q dot over Q . The next day may be a next demand limiting day. Once such a liner operator is found it is then applied to the changing temperature setpoint T i.e. T . This results in the next day s changing setpoint trajectory during the demand limiting period T step . That condition is mathematically represented by T T . More detailed descriptions of calculating the linear operator and applying the linear operator are included in the description that follows.

In one embodiment process diagrammed in linear operator is a weighted sum of the proportional integral and derivative of the deferred power during the training day s limited power period dot over Q step 

In some embodiments a larger 2 even integer n can be chosen to more heavily weight larger deviations from the target deferred cooling power use dot over Q . This can be desirable in situations where the total cost depends in part on the demand charge and the demand charge is largely based on load during peak periods. If dot over Q is constant during periods of constant cost the demand charge would come at a time of peak deviation from dot over Q .

The integral in the cost function Jis taken over the early start and demand limiting periods. The early start period refers to a small time period e.g. 15 minutes before the peak hours begin. When the demand charge increases by a large amount during peak hours an early start may help reduce the demand by the beginning of the peak hours. If on the other hand the demand is reduced after the beginning of the peak hours then the demand charge may be set at the level before the full potential of the response to the high demand charges has been achieved. Beginning the temperature setpoint trajectory during the early start period may help ensure that the peak demand charge will not be set at the beginning of the demand limiting period.

The temperature setpoint trajectory for the next day s early start and demand limiting periods is determined in terms of discrete variables. Sampling the power use at specific sampling times t kT during the early start and demand limiting periods of the training day results in discrete time equivalents. Determining the temperature setpoint trajectory for the next day requires calculation of the optimal weights for the proportional integral and derivative terms of the linear operator this process is diagrammed in . Two sets of basis vectors are associated with the demand limited period the output basis vectors and the input basis vectors.

The output basis vectors are the vectors of the samples of the deferred power during the limited power period dot over Q its derivative and its integral at the specific sampling times t kT step . These vectors are weighted together in order to obtain the target deferred power for the next day dot over Q . The output basis vectors are defined as 

In other embodiments of the invention multiple days of data can be used in finding the linear operator . If multiple days are used more weights can be used in the optimization problem. If noise is a concern a Savitzky Golay smoothing or similar filter may be applied to approximate the derivative of the signal. The Savitzky Golay smoothing filter would be used to reduce the amount of noise while maintaining the relative location and magnitude of peaks and valleys in the derivative signal.

The input basis vectors are described in a similar manner considering the derivative of the temperature setpoint to be the input to the system. The input basis vectors are 

In some situations the setpoint may be raised faster than the actual zone temperature increases at its minimum cooling position. When the temperature setpoint is raised too fast the zone temperature will float i.e. the temperature controller is no longer actively controlling the zone temperature because the actuator has become saturated. At this point the system is no longer linear. In such situations the process may include determining and using an estimate of the temperature setpoint that would have caused the controller to output its minimum flow. Such an estimate may be to use the measured zone temperature itself in place of the temperature setpoint when the zone is floating. 

In nearly all environments the temperature inside of the building is required to be confined to a specified comfort region with a minimum temperature and a maximum temperature . In some embodiments the temperature setpoint will be caused to transition from approximately to approximately during the early start and demand limiting period for near optimal control. This total change in temperature setpoint may be controlled to remain the same after the weights are applied to the input basis vectors. This control may be provided by causing the average derivative of the temperature setpoint to remain constant after the weights are applied. This control may be provided by scaling the input basis vectors such that each has an average value equal to that of the average temperature setpoint derivative step . The scale factors are given by 

Any of several alternative optimization routines could be used in order to find the optimal weights including sequential quadratic programming interior point method or pseudo inverse if n 2. Once the optimal weights are found they are applied in the same manner to find the derivative of the temperature setpoint that will be applied on the next day s demand limiting period. The temperature setpoint trajectory for the next day is given by 

Integrating the derivative of the temperature setpoint so that it can be applied to the zones of the building can result in non smooth setpoint trajectories ultimately leading to large spikes in the cooling power especially if the sample time of the setpoint trajectory is large. In order to eliminate this effect a Savitzky Golay smoothing or similar filter can be used on the temperature setpoint trajectory.

The output basis vectors may not span the function space containing the target deferred cooling power use dot over Q . In that case the derivative of the temperature setpoint can be adjusted based on a simple capacitive model of the building where the deferred power during the limited power period dot over Q dot over Q dot over Q as shown in is modeled as acting directly on a single capacitor. Thermal capacitance is governed by the equation where C is the thermal capacitance and is the actual temperature inside the building. A negative sign exists because dot over Q is taken positive for cooling. To estimate capacitance the total deferred energy Q that entered the building zone and the change in temperature is be measured over the entire early start and demand limiting periods. An estimate for the lumped building capacitance is given by

Once the capacitance is estimated the derivative of the setpoint trajectory for the next day dot over T can be adjusted to bring the expected deferred cooling power dot over circumflex over Q closer to the target deferred cooling power dot over Q using the simple capacitance model dot over Q C. If the optimal weights are not able to cause the estimated deferred cooling power dot over circumflex over Q for the next day to be identical to dot over Q then the derivative of the temperature setpoint can be increased at times when the estimate of the deferred cooling power is above dot over Q and decreased at times when the estimate of the deferred cooling power is below dot over Q . During the next demand limiting period the simple capacitive model yields

The technique for finding the setpoint trajectory that will cause the deferred cooling power to approximate some desired deferred cooling power dot over Q t based on the assumption of a linear system requires a determination of dot over Q t .

The optimal deferred cooling power use can be calculated or estimated by dividing the total deferred energy 

In the above systems and methods it may be desirable to have a given average cooling power over the demand limiting period so that dot over Q over that period is constant. Finding the optimal deferred cooling power is then finding the optimal average cooling power use for each time period of constant cost. This can be stated as 

To take temperature constraints into account the temperature constraints may be transformed into approximate deferred cooling power constraints. To avoid violating the temperature constraints therefore the sum of the deferred cooling power up to any point in time must be less than zero and greater than Q. If the sum were greater than zero at any point the temperature would likely violate the constraint. On the other hand if the sum were less than Qat any point then the temperature would likely violate the constraint. Adding these constraints yields the optimization problem 

This optimization problem can be performed via linear programming very efficiently by converting the cost function into a linear cost function with additional constraints. The linear form of this optimization problem is 

Thus far the cooling power that the building would be using if the temperature setpoint was not changed was assumed to be constant over the demand limiting period. The cooling power use was calculated by projecting the use just before the early start period began forward until the end of the demand limiting period. This may be appropriate in some embodiments and in some buildings. While the cooling power use under a constant setpoint during the demand limiting period may be nearly flat especially for shorter demand limiting periods changes in occupancy solar heating and outdoor ambient temperature may cause some variation in the cooling power use. If the cooling power use due to the constant setpoint is not separated from the decrease in cooling power use due the changing setpoint during the demand limiting period then some error may be induced in calculating the cooling power use due to the integral and derivative of the changing setpoint. A statistical model of the power use due to the constant setpoint during the demand limiting period may improve performance.

A simple model would be to take the mean of the cooling power use at each time of the day when temperature setpoints remain constant. The mean is taken over multiple days rather than over all times during the day i.e. if the cooling power is sampled at times t Tk each day then the mean is given by 

If the length of the demand limiting period changes or the temperature constraints are changed then past demand days become less useful for directly calculating the best setpoint trajectory for a demand limiting period with modified parameters. However the single capacitor model used above to calculate adjustments to the demand response system can be used to give an approximation of the optimal control trajectory that can be used as a starting point before additional basis vectors for the demand limiting period with the new parameters are obtained.

If the temperature constraints and are changed then the budget to defer cooling power use Qis also changed. The amount of this change can be approximated using the single capacitor model the increase in budget given by . The new deferrable load budget can be used to calculate dot over Q as shown above in calculating the optimal deferred cooling power use. Additionally the average derivative of the temperature setpoint dot over T must be increased to guarantee that the new setpoint will vary from to during the demand limiting period. The fractional increase in the average derivative must be the same as the fractional increase in T. The fractional increase is given by the sum of the weights therefore the constraint on calculating the estimated deferred cooling power dot over circumflex over Q must be modified to 

If the length of the demand limiting period is modified then the deferrable budget is not changed. Instead only the average derivative of the setpoint trajectory is modified. First the time scale is normalized so that the costs can be mapped onto times of the original data when calculating dot over Q . Then the constraint on calculating the estimated deferred cooling power dot over circumflex over Q is modified so that the sum of the weights guarantees an average derivative of the temperature setpoint such that the temperature setpoint transitions from to in the modified time frame. Because the derivative is inversely proportional to the time of the period the constraint becomes 

Referring now to the DR layer shown in is shown in greater detail according to an exemplary embodiment. DR layer includes demand limiting module . Demand limiting module is configured to control energy use of one or more building subsystems during a demand limiting period. Demand limiting module may include a plurality of sub modules configured to facilitate the demand limiting activity for varying types or numbers of building subsystems. In the exemplary embodiment shown in demand limiting module is shown to include a deferred energy budget calculator optimum power setpoint trajectory calculator and temperature setpoint trajectory calculator . Although only a single deferred energy budget calculator optimum power setpoint trajectory calculator and temperature setpoint trajectory calculator are shown in multiple deferred energy budget calculators optimum power setpoint trajectory calculators and temperature setpoint trajectory calculators may be provided in any one demand limiting module demand response layer or smart building manager. For example a different deferred energy budget calculator a different optimum power setpoint trajectory calculator and a different temperature setpoint trajectory calculator may be provided for each building subsystem to be controlled in a demand limiting fashion.

The DR layer receives information from event data which corresponds to a store or stream of real time near real time or other parameters associated with demand limiting module . Event data may include meter data e.g. a measured energy or power draw from smart grid by the building a measured energy or power use by HVAC subsystem or a device thereof etc. received from a building meter sub meter associated only with the HVAC subsystem a device that estimates energy use based on other building automation system values or another device that measures energy use. Event data may also include building subsystem data which may include measured or calculated values associated with HVAC subsystem e.g. temperature data air flow data pressure data etc. . Event data may further include pricing data for electrical energy use of smart grid . Pricing data may be preloaded or provided by energy provider periodically or in real time. Event data may also include other parameters which provide additional constraints for the operation of demand limiting module or to override its default operation. For example other parameters may include timing information e.g. a start time to begin demand limiting an end time to end demand limiting a length of time for the demand limiting period etc. threshold information e.g. temperature constraints or thresholds that define an acceptable comfort range an acceptable energy use based on financial constraints etc. or override parameters e.g. a parameter that disables demand limiting module a parameter that changes the control strategy of feedback controller etc. .

The DR layer also includes DR History which stores previous values associated with demand limiting module . The DR History may include historical events such as historical pricing data historical building subsystem data or other historical parameters . The DR History may also include historical setpoints associated with demand limiting module e.g. previous energy use setpoints previous temperature setpoints etc. . DR History may provide demand limiting module with data for using previous measurements and values to adapt to future conditions and to generate new energy use setpoints.

Demand limiting module is configured to use a series of calculators and to control energy use of a building subsystem. The calculators and are configured to receive process generate and output data and various operating parameters during the demand limiting period including total energy output power usage trajectory and temperature setpoint trajectory . In the illustration of deferred energy budget calculator determines the total energy Q that can be added to the building without violating temperature constraints based on DR history and event data . The event data considered include weather occupancy and length of demand limiting period. Deferred energy budget calculator also accounts for constraints on the actual temperature inside of the building . Based on the total energy determined by the deferred energy budget calculator and utility pricing data from event data the optimum power setpoint trajectory calculator determines the optimum deferred cooling power use dot over Q . Processes for determining the optimum deferred cooling power use are described above.

Though shows that utility pricing data is considered by the optimum power setpoint trajectory calculator utility pricing data and other event data could be factored into other components of the demand limiting module . The optimum deferred cooling power use is provided to the temperature setpoint trajectory calculator . The temperature setpoint trajectory calculator determines the setpoint trajectory that accomplishes the optimum deferred cooling power use. Such determinations are described in detail in the above description. The temperature setpoint trajectory calculator provides the setpoint trajectory to the HVAC system . Temperature setpoint trajectory calculator can override user provided temperature setpoints provided to HVAC subsystem during a demand limiting period.

In other embodiments demand limiting module can operate the HVAC subsystem outside of a demand limiting period. Demand limiting module is configured to manipulate one or more HVAC subsystem setpoints e.g. a temperature setpoint based on the energy use setpoint and measured energy use. In some embodiments one or more components of demand limiting module may be integrated directly into the control of a device in HVAC subsystem thereby providing direct control over the subsystem or a device thereof. In other embodiments one or more components of demand limiting module may be used as part of a cascading control strategy for a device in HVAC subsystem and provide one or more device setpoints to the controller of the device. For example a temperature setpoint may be sent from demand limiting module to one or more controllers that regulate a variable air volume VAV box an air handling unit AHU or a chiller in HVAC subsystem based on the received temperature setpoint.

In general the energy use setpoint and the measured energy use may be values that correspond to the use of energy by one or more devices in HVAC subsystem . For example the energy use setpoint may be a heat transfer rate or an electrical power rate e.g. in units of kW indicative of electrical power used by HVAC subsystem . In some embodiments the energy use setpoint and the measured energy use may be values that correspond to an overall building energy usage consumption and or power .

In some embodiments a proxy value may also be used to represent an energy use. For example if demand limiting module is used to provide direct control over a device in HVAC subsystem such as a VAV box a flow setpoint may be used as a proxy for the energy use setpoint and a flow reading may be used as a proxy for the measured energy use.

Referring now to a complete illustration of a process for controlling energy use in a building shown according to an exemplary embodiment. The process of is shown to include obtaining a length of the demand limiting period a maximum temperature and a minimum temperature step . These constraints may be used as described above.

The process of is further shown to include collecting data from previous demand limiting days and or one or more training days step . In some situations a single training day may be used followed by using real historical data from previous demand limiting days. In other situations training days could be conducted fairly regularly e.g. once a week to provide a reset to the system. Such a reset may advantageously allow the system to adapt faster to changing weather patterns building changes or other transient conditions.

The process of further includes determining the desired trajectory for the cooling power step . Determining the desired trajectory for the cooling power may be conducted as described above in the finding optimal cooling power use section.

The process of further includes finding a linear operator that when applied to the previous set of cooling power trajectories results in the desired cooling power trajectory step . Processes for finding such a linear operator are described above.

The process of further includes the step of applying the linear operator to the derivative of the setpoint trajectory to obtain a new derivative of the setpoint trajectory step . Fine adjustments may be performed on the derivative using a single capacitor model of the building step . Integrating the adjusted derivative may provide the absolute numbers of the setpoint trajectory step . The setpoint trajectory may then be applied to the next demand limiting day step . Applying a setpoint trajectory to a day can mean causing building controllers to use the setpoint trajectory to adjust their respective temperature setpoints throughout the day. As shown in the process can loop back to step . Instead of historical data from a training day the historical data used may be from the previous day.
