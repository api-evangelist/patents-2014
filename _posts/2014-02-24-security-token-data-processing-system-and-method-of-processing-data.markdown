This application claims the priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 of European patent application no. 13159912.8 filed on Mar. 19 2013 the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.

The invention relates to a security token in particular to a smart card. Furthermore the invention relates to a data processing system. Furthermore the invention relates to a method of processing data.

In many public and private data processing systems applications are executed on data processing devices for example personal computers laptops tablets and terminals. In these data processing systems special care has to be taken to accommodate a robust safe and secure user input interface. The user input interface is typically available through a desktop application programming interface API between a physical input device a keyboard for example and processing elements of the data processing device. Secure physical input devices include expensive touch screens and special protected keyboards. In case of keyboards in public applications it is difficult to keep the keys clean. Furthermore in case of explosion endangered environments keyboards may not be allowed. Furthermore in security relevant environments it is required to protect the user entries against skimming which currently requires high effort and cost.

It is an object of the invention to facilitate user input in data processing systems in particular by providing a robust safe and secure yet cost effective user input interface. This object is achieved by a security token as claimed in claim a data processing system as claimed in claim and a method of processing data as claimed in claim .

According to an aspect of the invention a security token is conceived in particular a smart card comprising a tactile sensing user interface wherein said tactile sensing user interface is adapted to capture a stream of position data corresponding to a sequence of positions of a finger engaging with said tactile sensing user interface and representing a stream of input data for a data processing device said security token being adapted to transmit said stream of position data to a host system for further processing.

According to an exemplary embodiment the security token is further adapted to encrypt the stream of position data before transmitting said stream of position data to the host system.

According to a further exemplary embodiment the security token is further adapted to format the stream of position data as application protocol data units before transmitting said stream of position data to the host system.

According to a further exemplary embodiment the security token comprises a contact based interface for transmitting said stream of position data to the host system.

According to a further exemplary embodiment the security token comprises a contactless interface for transmitting said stream of position data to the host system.

According to a further exemplary embodiment the security token is further adapted to provide a single factor or multi factor user authentication function.

According to a further aspect of the invention a data processing system is conceived which comprises a security token of the kind set forth and a host system wherein the host system comprises a data processing device and wherein the host system is adapted to receive the stream of position data and to convert said stream of position data into the stream of input data for said data processing device.

According to a further exemplary embodiment the host system comprises a computer program or a secure element for converting said stream of position data into the stream of input data for said data processing device.

According to a further exemplary embodiment the input data comprise data representing a movement of a pointing device and or data representing a selection operation performable on a pointing device.

According to a further exemplary embodiment the input data comprise special keys as defined on a keyboard and or special character keys as defined on a keyboard.

According to a further exemplary embodiment the data processing device is one of the group of a personal computer a portable computer a web tablet a terminal a mobile device a vehicle an industrial process control device.

According to a further aspect of the invention a method of processing data is conceived wherein a tactile sensing user interface comprised in a security token in particular in a smart card captures a stream of position data corresponding to a sequence of positions of a finger engaging with said tactile sensing user interface and representing a stream of input data for a data processing device and wherein the security token transmits said stream of position data to a host system for further processing.

In accordance with the present disclosure a user interface is conceived that enables control of host applications running on a data processing device e.g. a PC mobile device terminal web server by means of a smart card contactless contact based or dual interface comprising a two dimensional tactile sensor i.e. a tactile sensing user interface adapted to locate the position of a finger engaging with said tactile sensor. A stream of position data may be captured by the sensor translated into machine readable format and communicated via a standard smart card reader to a host system. A contactless reader and a host system may be combined in a single device for example in an NFC enabled mobile device.

In case of security relevant applications the stream of position data may be encrypted by the smart card before it is transmitted to the host system. A computer program or a secure element on the host system may decrypt the position data received from the smart card and translate them into input data requested by a host application running on a data processing device of the host system. Depending on the host application demand the position data may be translated into numbers characters special characters special keys space arrow keys backspace return shift control caps lock mouse positions mouse button commands for example. The translated position data may be provided to the data processing device by the computer program through standard system APIs such as keyboard drivers and mouse drivers. The kernel32.dll Windows API is a typical example of such an API.

Thus the smart card may effectively substitute a conventional user input device such as a keyboard or a touch screen. The translation of position data into input data for the data processing device may require enrolment of a specific user. Reference templates generated during enrolment may be stored in a database of the host system.

As mentioned above a smart card according to the present disclosure comprises a two dimensional tactile sensor that is configured to locate the position of a finger engaging with the tactile sensor. The tactile sensor may use capacitive proximity sensing pressure sensing or any other technology or combinations thereof suited to provide the required position information. The sensor may involve a microprocessor unit comprising a firmware component configured to execute position capturing and generation of position data from tactile sensor signals.

Optionally the smart card may have a secure element configured to encrypt the position data provided by the tactile sensor. Furthermore the smart card may communicate the encrypted position data through communication channels as specified in standards such as ISO7816 ISO14443 NFC involving required hardware means such as contact based readers contactless readers and NFC interfaces respectively. The optionally encrypted position data may be packed in application protocol data unit APDU containers for proper transfer.

A software component executable by the host system may be configured to receive the stream of position data provided by the smart card through a contact based reader contactless reader or NFC interface as the case may be. The contact based reader contactless reader or NFC interface may be connected to said host system or may form part of said host system. The software may make use of a software interface such as the PCSC interface or the JAVA smart card API. Furthermore the software may interfere with the host system s API for example a Windows API in the sense that it may process the position data and may regenerates user input data from them such as numbers characters special characters special keys space arrow keys backspace return shift control alt caps lock mouse positions and mouse button commands.

Subsequently the software may forward the regenerated i.e. translated position data to the related interfaces in the host system s API by suitable means which are known per se. This may require a special keyboard driver and a special mouse driver that fit to the standard interfaces of the host system for a keyboard and a pointing device i.e. a mouse. These drivers may derive information from the system API that may control whether position data is to be interpreted as keyboard data or mouse data. This may be required since the same position data could be used to generate keyboard data and mouse data. In case keyboard data is requested the software may interpret certain position data patterns as character keys. Among the keys that may be recognized are digit keys 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 character keys A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z special character keys special keys Space Shift Shift Lock Control Alt Backspace Enter Function Keys and menu control keys Left Right Up Down .

In case of correlated similar patterns the user may have a means to select between available interpretation options that may be implemented by a scrolling function that may scroll through the various options. This feature may apply to patterns such as 0 Q O 2 Z 5 S 1 I J and U V . In case of correlated patterns selection between options may not be required if a context sensitive interpretation can be applied that can identify the right character. In case mouse data are requested the software interprets certain position data patterns as a left mouse button a right mouse button plain position data and a double click. The information whether a left mouse click or a right mouse click has been entered may be derived from the application context. During a pointing session a simple lift off and lift down may represent a right mouse click and a double lift off and lift down may represent a double click. A left button click and button hold may be implemented by a toggle function where the first double touch means a left button click and button hold and a second double touch releases the button.

The smartcard comprises a first CPU and a second CPU which may be configured by means of software for the required data processing. The power required by the smart card system may in contactless operation be obtained from a power unit that rectifies the antenna signal from the antenna and regulates it to the required voltage level. In contact mode the supply voltage provided by the contact interface may be regulated by the power unit . In contactless mode the RFID interface unit may demodulate the antenna signal in order to obtain the payload information from the host system. The RFID interface unit may also modulate the payload information generated by the smart card system and may provide the modulated signal through the antenna to the host system. In contact mode information exchange between the host system and the first CPU may be implemented through an ISO7816 interface represented by the contact interface . The second CPU may process tactile information provided by the input structures may forward information to output structures or to the status indicator for user feedback or it may change the electrical status of general input output GPIOs devices. Firmware and data required to define the function of the first CPU may be stored in a storage unit attached to that CPU . Likewise firmware and data required to define the function of the second CPU may be stored in a storage unit attached to that CPU .

In order to minimize costs the smart card system may be assembled on a single substrate or system inlay which is made from the same material as the embedding card. After lamination it may form together with the other card layers a solid block of material. Chip components may be assembled using direct chip attach thus avoiding costly chip packages. Passive components may either be soldered by low temperature solder or may be glued using ICP silicon paste. A compensation layer with a cut out at chip and component positions may be put on top of the substrate . A top layer and a bottom layer may complete the card construction. The card layers may either be directly laminated or thin glue layers may be used to link the various card layers.

In case of lamination without glue layers the substrate material may be identical to the embedding material except the softening temperature which may have a higher softening temperature than that of the embedding material. As a consequence the PCB structures on the substrate may be maintained during lamination. Polyurethane foil TPU may be used as glue layer. After card lamination an opening may be milled into the card s surface that may reach down to the substrate s connection layer. A contact module may be assembled into the milled cut out either by ACA glue ACF NCA glue NCF by soldering or other means with the objective to fix the contact module. The contact module may be configured to provide contact between the contact modules surface and the smart card substrate in order to connect the contact interface to the related smart card components.

In said enrolment mode a collection of tactile reference patterns representing a code alphabet may be stored in machine readable format in a database on the host system. An additional code conversion table may be used to increase the code entropy. In said recognition mode entered tactile patterns may be converted into machine readable format and then correlated against characters of the trained code alphabet stored in machine readable format in a database on the host system. A classifier based on a correlator may determine the code alphabet member that has been entered. Multiple character entries may form a personal identification number PIN code. Furthermore in accordance with the present disclosure a pointing device mode or mouse mode may be defined. For example in said pointing device mode the tactile data obtained from the tactile sensor may be converted in machine readable position data that may be sent via the selected communication interface to the host system for further processing.

In case of increased security requirements the tactile pattern recognition process may also be implemented directly on the smart card. In this case the tactile reference patterns may be stored in the secure environment of a secure element on the smart card. Also recognized user keypad input may be transferred to the host application for further processing. Mouse input will directly be transferred to the host system for further processing.

In another exemplary embodiment only the reference patterns required for PIN code authentication may be stored on the smart card and only the pattern recognition required for user authentication may be executed on the smart card. In this case transfer of position data from the smart card to the host may be enabled by successful authentication and all subsequent position data may be sent for recognition or processing to the host application. This implementation may offer a good compromise between security requirements and flexibility.

A smart card of the kind set forth may be used in a variety of application areas. For example the smart card may be used to provide a personalized and secure user input interface for industrial process control to provide a simple user interface for public web access and to provide payment or access control functions including multi factor authentication. Furthermore the smart card may combine the function of a company card with a user specific control function. This may be required by hospitals where safety relevant devices must only be controlled by authorized staff. Furthermore the smart card may enable new services based on control functions that require access rights or pay per use rights. In case of pay per use payment may also be handled by a concurrent smart card application. In addition the smart card may enable user specific control functions in applications where neither touch screens nor keyboards are allowed as well as user specific control functions in applications where a user specific control interface may be required. Furthermore the smart card may enable control functions that for cost reasons do not allow touch screens or special keyboards. Furthermore the smart card may enable control functions that require logging of the control events. Furthermore the smart card may be used to provide a simple control interface in private applications where simple authentication combined with control is required for example when opening a garage door.

In a more specific application the data processing device is a manufacturing process control interface . A contact based reader may be connected to the manufacturing process control interface . An authentication application running on the manufacturing process control interface may request the user to enter his access information for example a PIN . Upon successful entry and verification of the access information control over the manufacturing process control interface may be enabled such that keyboard and or mouse information can be provided to the manufacturing process control interface .

The smart card may also be connected to the manufacturing process control interface through a contactless reader. As long as the user provides input to the tactile sensor embedded in the smart card position data may be sent to the manufacturing process control interface and the manufacturing process control interface may translate said position data into control data in the form of keyboard or mouse data for controlling the manufacturing process. As soon as the user removes the smart card from the contactless reader the control session can be terminated and the user can be logged off. In addition there may be a need to read out a log of executed control operations. In such cases it may be feasible to provide the logged control information through available external displays such as the display of an NFC enabled mobile device or a PC Laptop connected through a contact based or contactless interface.
