This invention relates generally to the field of wireless network systems. More particularly the invention relates to an improved architecture and method for connecting configuring and testing new wireless Machine to Machine M2M devices and applications.

Virtually all wireless carriers today offer both voice and data services. illustrates a high level architecture of a wireless service provider communicating with one wireless device using both voice and data channels and communicating with a second wireless device using only a data channel. By way of example many wireless carriers employ the Global System for Mobile Communications GSM standard to support voice traffic and the General Packet Radio Service GPRS standard to support data traffic over the same wireless network. In such a configuration voice logic and circuitry shown in processes the GSM voice traffic and separate data logic and circuitry processes the GPRS data traffic. While some of the embodiments of the invention described below implement the GPRS standard for data services and GSM for voice services it should be noted that the underlying principles of the present invention are not limited to any particular wireless network protocol.

Using the data channel wireless devices communicate with external servers such as Web servers instant messaging servers and email servers via the Internet or other packet based data network . One particular type of wireless device configured for data traffic only is a Machine to Machine hereinafter M2M device. M2M devices are deployed in application specific telemetry systems to collect data using sensors and transmit the data to a destination such as a server accessible over the Internet or other data network . In the past telemetry systems were the exclusive domain of very large well financed organizations. For example large oil and gas companies and electric utilities through the use of custom built proprietary data networks were some of the first private organizations to use telemetry. In recent years however the cost of access to public wireless data networks has dropped opening the door for new cost effective M2M applications including for example fleet management point of sale transactions consumer electronics healthcare monitoring security and surveillance to name a few.

Even with the decreased cost for wireless data communication however the process of customer acquisition and onboarding remains time consuming and inefficient requiring a significant amount of manual effort on the part of the prospective customer. In order to develop such applications a prospective customer must engage with the members of the sales team at the wireless service provider typically cellular carriers or their resellers and provide detailed plans business projections and technical details just to get started. Once the process is initiated each step along the way takes a lengthy amount of time and manual effort on the part of multiple individuals inside the service provider organization. For example it may require a significant amount of time to simply receive usable Subscriber Identity Modules SIMs for testing purposes. Even after receiving usable SIMs from the service provider the prospective customer still has the daunting task of designing the final product and very little help is provided to iron out various defects bugs introduced at this early stage. Moreover the sales team at the wireless service provider has very little if any visibility into how the prospective customer is progressing often resulting in time wasted chasing poor quality prospective customers. This process can take many months typically between 6 18 months and during this time both the prospective customer and the service provider waste a lot of time and effort in these discussions.

Consequently what is needed is a more efficient system and method which addresses the current inefficiencies associated with integrating new customers and new wireless data applications.

Described below is a system and method for designing and integrating new wireless data applications on a cellular network. Throughout the description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent however to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form to avoid obscuring the underlying principles of the present invention.

The embodiments of the invention described below reduce the time and cost associated with acquiring new wireless data customers and deploying new wireless applications. In particular in one embodiment a Web based system and method for customer acquisition and onboarding are employed with guides for quality design efficient techniques for testing configuring and troubleshooting new wireless devices and dashboards for monitoring and managing the Web based distribution channel.

A system architecture according to one embodiment of the invention is illustrated in . In this embodiment a control center is communicatively coupled to a test computer over a wireless network operated by a wireless service provider. The control center may also be coupled to the test computer through an Internet connection if one is available. This Internet connection is sometimes referred to below as a direct channel between the Test Computer and the control center . The control center includes a plurality of servers for implementing the various functional modules illustrated in e.g. by executing program code designed to perform the various functions . The control center also includes a plurality of databases for storing data related to users and wireless devices.

In operation a prospective wireless data customer visits a trial order Website and requests trial SIMs through a Web based user interface certain embodiments of which are illustrated in As shown in the Web based user interface includes a drop down menu containing a selectable list of wireless modules supported by the wireless service provider. In the illustrated embodiment the service provider is AT T and the wireless modules include those wireless modules supported on the AT T data network. However the underlying principles of the invention are not limited to any particular service provider. Other information entered in the Web based user interface include contact information user name address etc account information for specifying a user name and password for a new user account a referral code payment information e.g. credit card data billing information and shipping information . In one embodiment the Website includes data verification logic to ensure that the data entered in the various data fields is in the correct data format. In addition although not shown in the figures the trial order Website includes a connection to a credit card issuer system to verify the credit card payment information entered by the user. While various different platforms may be used to implement the trial order Website and other Web based user interface features described herein in one embodiment the Website is an Apache Tomcat web server running on Linux with software programmed in Java using an Oracle database.

Upon entering all requested information the Website verifies the transaction and transmits the user and device data to a registration system . In one embodiment the registration system exposes an Application Programming Interface API to the trial order Website and the trial order Website communicates data to the registration system using the API. The interactions between the Web site and the registration system may be formatted as a Web services based transaction with user data embedded in one or more Extensible Markup Language XML files using the SOAP protocol. However various other data communication protocols may be employed while still complying with the underlying principles of the invention.

In response to receipt of the user data the registration system establishes a new user account and executes a series of database operations to open new record s in a user database and an accounts database . For example the user s name and contact information may be stored in the user database and a new account may be opened for the user in the accounts database including an account number wireless device identification codes etc. . In one embodiment the various databases shown in are not actually separate databases but rather separate data structures e.g. tables within a single relational database.

In one embodiment a device management system automatically provisions trial SIMs on behalf of the user within a wireless device database . As part of the provisioning process an identification code for each trial SIM is automatically associated with data services offered by the wireless service provider. Each SIM includes a unique serial number international unique number of the mobile user IMSI security authentication and ciphering information temporary information related to the local network a list of services to which the user is provided access and password data. In one embodiment the SIMs are initially provisioned with limited trial functionality for application development and testing purposes. For example in one embodiment data transmission thresholds are set to limit the amount of data which the trial SIMs may utilize during the testing period. In addition in one embodiment the SIMs are provisioned to operate only for a specified trial period. At the end of the trial period the SIMs are automatically disabled and or de provisioned and will no longer be permitted access to the wireless service provider network.

As part of the provisioning process the SIMs are automatically registered with the Home Location Register HLR of the wireless service provider . An HLR is a central database containing details of each mobile data subscriber authorized to use the wireless network. While the HLR is illustrated in within the domain of the control center in one embodiment the HLR communicates with a central HLR maintained by the wireless service provider. Alternatively in one embodiment the entire HLR is maintained by the service provider and the service provider is provided access to the data stored within the wireless device database during the provisioning process. The underlying principles of the invention are not limited to any particular HLR database configuration.

Following the automatic provisioning of the trial SIMs and registration of the user the owner operator of the control center sends a wireless development kit to the user containing the trial SIMs and an M2M test device with application software for testing and configuration. As illustrated in one embodiment of the test device comprises a wireless device with a Universal Serial Bus USB interface for connecting to the USB port of a standard computer system . However the underlying principles of the invention are not limited to any particular interface type. Other interface types which may be used in lieu of USB include by way of example and not limitation IEEE 1394b Firewire and eSATA. In one embodiment the computer system is a Windows based computer with an Intel Core 2 Duo Core i7 or similar x86 based processor 2 4 GBytes of DDR2 or DDR3 memory and a 250 GByte or larger Serial ATA hard drive. Various other computer configurations may also be used while still complying with the underlying principles of the invention. For example in one embodiment the test computer is a Macintosh computer system such as a Macbook Pro or Mac Pro desktop.

One embodiment of the wireless USB device includes a flash memory for storing testing and monitoring program code . The flash memory may be integrated directly within the device or may take the form of a memory card coupled to a memory card slot within the USB device e.g. a Secure Digital card slot . In one embodiment the USB device includes a wireless modem module pre configured to communicate over the wireless network and a SIM interface into which the pre provisioned trial SIMs may be connected for configuring testing and debugging wireless applications. Once inserted into the SIM interface the SIM card authorizes the wireless USB device to communicate over the wireless service provider s network according to the provisioning parameters associated with the SIM card . In one particular embodiment the USB device is a Sierra Wireless Compass 885 or 888 which include a wide area modem for 7.2 Mbps for HSPA networks.

In one embodiment when the USB device is initially inserted into the USB port of the test computer auto installation logic e.g. an automatic installation script is executed and upon authorization by the end user the testing and monitoring program code is automatically installed and executed on the test computer .

In one embodiment the USB device is preconfigured with the Access Point Name APN i.e. the network address used to identify a Gateway GPRS Support Node GGSN at the control center . During the testing and configuration process all wireless cellular communication with the control center is routed through the GGSN . In addition to the APN the USB device is also configured with the hostname of the control center diagnostics system which includes one or more test servers used for IP traffic testing.

In one embodiment the provisioning parameters for each SIM includes a communication profile specifying the wireless services allocated to the SIM e.g. whether Short Message Service SMS or voice functionality are permitted roaming restrictions etc . The provisioning parameters also include the rate plan associated with the SIMs including the financial parameters i.e. the price the amount of data permitted under the financial parameters overage rates etc. As previously described in one embodiment each trial SIM is allocated a limited amount of data usage for testing and troubleshooting purposes and is not provided with voice or SMS communication services. In one embodiment even though the SIM is not provisioned for voice service the SIM is provided with GSM functionality in order to be authorized with GSM network prior to connecting to the GPRS network.

As mentioned above the testing and monitoring program code automatically establishes a connection with the control center over the wireless cellular network and or a direct channel through the Internet and executes a series of automated tests thereby saving the end user a significant amount of time and effort in the process of developing new wireless applications. Moreover because the SIMs received by the end user are pre provisioned and the USB device is pre configured by the control center the USB device is capable of establishing a wireless connection with minimal effort on the part of the prospective customer.

One embodiment of a computer implemented method for testing monitoring and debugging the USB device is illustrated in and a series of screenshots of a graphical user interface GUI employed by the testing and monitoring program code is illustrated in 

Turning initially to the method of at step the testing and monitoring program code tests the provisioning of the USB device with a particular trial SIM installed. In one embodiment this involves checking the following parameters to determine whether traffic is allowed using the given SIM a the SIM s status must be Activation Ready or Activated b the SIM must not have been blocked due to excessive signaling activity and c the SIM must not have been blocked due to excessive data usage beyond user defined overage limits.

Assuming that the foregoing conditions are met the USB device with the SIM passes the provisioning test step . A test failure indicates that one or more of the foregoing conditions were not met. For example if the SIM s status is not Activation Ready or Activated or if the SIM has been blocked due to excessive signaling or excessive data usage then the USB device with the SIM will fail the provisioning step . In response one embodiment of the testing and monitoring program code performs troubleshooting operations to fix the problem and or notifies the user of troubleshooting steps to be taken. For example if the SIM s status is not Active or Activation Ready then the testing and monitoring program may check to ensure that the SIM s status is correctly reflected in the wireless device database .

At step the testing and monitoring program code tests the USB device and trial SIM. In one embodiment this test involves determining whether the given USB device and SIM are available on the network based on one of two factors whichever comes first a reporting from the device via direct channel diagnostics or b any detected wireless signaling activity. With respect to a the direct channel comprises the direct connection of the test computer to the diagnostics system through the Internet . In one embodiment the testing and monitoring program code reports its status to the diagnostics system periodically through the direct channel. These reports may include local wireless statistics such as signal strength and data usage. If the device is unable to connect wirelessly due to lack of coverage or low signal strength the direct channel provides valuable diagnostic information that would otherwise be unavailable to the diagnostics system.

If a direct channel connection or wireless connection are detected then the USB device and SIM pass the device SIM testing step illustrated in . In one embodiment if neither connection is detected then troubleshooting steps are implemented including instructing the user to confirm that the SIM card is inserted properly and determining whether wireless coverage exists at the test location. For example in one embodiment the control center and or the testing and monitoring program code maintains a database of service coverage locations. If the current location of the wireless device is outside of the coverage location then the testing and monitoring program code may notify the user that coverage is not available at the current location. The user s current location may be determined manually e.g. by requesting the current address or zip code for the user or automatically using GPS if the user s test computer is equipped with GPS capabilities .

The user may also be asked to verify that the USB device has adequate signal strength e.g. greater than 1 bar or a RSSI of 5 or more verify that the device s antenna is properly connected verify the USB device is configured with the proper frequency bands 850 1900 MHz for the US and 900 1800 MHz for Europe and or verify whether other wireless devices e.g. GSM GPRS cell phones in the proximity are working. Upon verification of one or more of the above variables the testing and monitoring program code may re execute step in to re test the USB device SIM card.

At step the testing and monitoring program code tests the USB device s wireless network connection. In one embodiment this involves checking the Home Location Register to determine whether there has been any recent wireless signaling from the USB device . There are three types of wireless signaling which may be detected a GSM authorization request a Mobile Switching Center MSC Location Update and or a Serving GPRS Support Node SGSN Location Update. The presence of any of these signaling events indicates that the device has successfully registered on the GSM voice network and or the GPRS data network. As such if any of these signaling events are detected the testing and monitoring program code indicates that the USB device has passed the wireless network testing step in .

If none of these signaling events are detected then the testing and monitoring program code may initiate one or more troubleshooting operations. For example in one embodiment the control center may transmit an SMS message to the USB device . If the SMS message is successful then GSM service is available but perhaps not the GPRS service . In addition the testing and monitoring program code may check the GSM and GPRS registration using AT commands sent to the wireless modem e.g. to verify GSM registration the AT CREG command should return CREG x 1 or CREG x 5 where x is 0 1 or 2 to verify GPRS registration the AT CGATT command should return CGATT 1 and AT CGREG should return CGREG x 1 or CGREG x 5 where x is 0 1 or 2 . Finally the testing and monitoring program code may perform a soft reset of the USB device or the end user may be prompted to perform a hard reset of the USB device .

Returning to at step the testing and monitoring program code tests the IP Internet connection of the USB device . In one embodiment this test includes two parts 

Assuming that the above conditions are met the testing and monitoring program code confirms that the USB device has passed the IP Internet test step . If these conditions have not been met the possible reasons include the APN is not configured properly the USB device is unable to open ports or sockets the IP address is incorrect and or the IP data cannot flow bi directionally.

In one embodiment the testing and monitoring program code automatically performs the following troubleshooting operations and or instructs the user to manually perform these operations 

In one embodiment the results of all of the foregoing tests and troubleshooting steps are stored within a diagnostics database . If necessary the results may be reviewed by personnel within the control center to provide guidance to the prospective customer when troubleshooting new wireless applications. In one embodiment local environment statistics are transmitted to the diagnostics database such as wireless signal strength of the trial device. The local environment statistics and other test data are then usable for performing diagnostics for the trial device and or aggregated across different trial devices to construct an estimate of the conditions in a given geographical area.

One embodiment of the invention is implemented on an independent stand alone wireless device such as a Windows Mobile device. In this embodiment the trial SIM may be installed and the testing and monitoring software may be executed directly on the independent mobile device e.g. loaded from non volatile to volatile memory and executed by the mobile device s processor . Consequently there is no need for an additional computer system in this implementation.

Moreover in one embodiment the testing and monitoring software automatically checks for updates prior to executing the various tests and troubleshooting steps described above. The updates may include patches and additional tests troubleshooting operations. If an update is available the testing and monitoring software automatically installs the update upon confirmation by the end user and then executes the tests.

As each step in the test script is completed an indication of the results is provided within each graphical element . For example in a Passed indication is provided within graphical element to indicate that the USB device passed the provisioning step and a Failed indication is provided within graphical element to indicate that the USB device failed the device SIM step . In the event that the USB device fails one of the test steps a scrollable window is generated within the graphical element corresponding to the failed step to provide troubleshooting information to the end user. For example in response to the failure of the device SIM card test troubleshooting instructions are provided to the end user to help determine the problem.

As illustrated in one embodiment of the control center includes a Web server which dynamically generates a Web based graphical user interface for monitoring and managing wireless devices which have been added to the system e.g. following the testing and troubleshooting techniques described above . Using the Web based GUI customers and potential customers are provided with comprehensive access to all data stored in the wireless device database and the diagnostics database . This information may be used to monitor manage and troubleshoot wireless devices. As shown in in one embodiment a link to the Web server is provided in the testing window to provide quick access to the control center Web server .

As illustrated in in one embodiment the user is initially provided with a tour of the control center Website. The tour includes a sequence of informational windows identifying various aspects of the control center with certain features of the control center GUI displayed behind the informational windows. As shown in a series of selectable tabs are provided at the top of the control center GUI to enable a customer or potential customer to efficiently identify information related to the customer s wireless devices. In the specific embodiment illustrated the tabs include wireless devices billing information device coverage information account information alerts support and reports.

In the embodiments show in the devices tab is selected thereby generating a table containing information related to each of the customer s wireless devices. Specifically as indicated in column headings the information includes the SIM identification code for each wireless device ICCID . The status associated with each wireless device e.g. an indication as to whether the SIM device has been activated a device ID code an indication as to whether the device is currently connected to the control center the date each wireless device was added to the system and a modem ID uniquely identifying the wireless modem used on each device. Links are also provided to provide access to diagnostics for each wireless device and a spotlight feature which provides detailed connectivity information for each device e.g. when and where different connectivity events occurred . The spotlight feature is described in Co Pending patent application Ser. No. 12 387 962 entitled Virtual Diagnostic System for Wireless Communications Network Systems filed on May 7 2009 which is assigned to the assignee of the present application and which is incorporated herein by reference.
