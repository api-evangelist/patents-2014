The present invention relates generally to the field of compliance and more particularly to information technology IT management of information assets.

Medium to large sized companies often have information technology IT infrastructure that is geographically distributed across multiple locations in different countries. Furthermore this IT infrastructure may be divided into different zones of security such as core enterprise zones with the highest security requirements zones for development and test systems with lower security requirements and perhaps areas like demilitarized zones DMZs where the systems hosting a company s web presence are located. Having operations that span multiple countries such companies might need to comply with many different regulations applicable to the various information assets the company has. For example sensitive information about customers and employees is governed by regulation in many countries.

An IT assets inventory system change and configuration management database CCMDB or configuration management database CMDB is an IT repository that collects and stores information about IT assets known as configuration items CIs as well as descriptive relationships between those assets. CMDBs typically record three types of information about CIs i technical attributes ii ownership attributes and iii relationship attributes. They may possess the ability to automatically discover information about CIs and to track changes to these assets over time as well. CMDBs help an organization track system configurations understand the relationships such as sources and dependencies between the components of a system and ensure that all changes are made using standardized and efficient methods processes and procedures that meet change objectives while minimizing detrimental impacts.

A metadata database which may include a business glossary provides a centralized location in an organization where enterprise business technical and operational metadata is stored classified and maintained. A typical metadata database stores terms and other business objects together with their associated semantics and relationships including precise definitions and allows only authorized individuals to make changes or access data elements with mandatory access control. Linked to the terms are logical and physical data models as well as information about where they are deployed in operational systems such as databases. In addition policies used to govern the IT assets linked to the terms through relationships between the terms and technical metadata may be part of a metadata database. Such a system promotes confident use of shared information and improved data governance throughout an organization by providing a consistent business context and meaning around IT assets data and business processes.

Security information and event management SIEM tools provide a range of services for analyzing managing monitoring and reporting on IT security events and vulnerabilities. Such services typically include collection of events regarding monitored accesses and unexpected occurrences across the data network and analyzing them in a correlative context to determine their contribution to profiled higher order security events. They may also include analysis of firewall configurations network topology and connection visualization tools for viewing current and potential network traffic patterns correlation of asset vulnerabilities with network configuration and traffic to identify active attack paths and high risk assets and support of policy compliance monitoring of network traffic topology and vulnerability exposures.

Information integration and governance IIG tools support data security and data privacy efforts by assuring the integrity of trusted data center information. They may include features for centralized controls for real time data security and monitoring fine grained database auditing automated compliance reporting data level access control database vulnerability management and auto discovery of sensitive data.

According to one aspect of the present disclosure there is a computer program product system and or method which performs the following actions not necessarily in the following order and not necessarily in serial sequence i discovers a first piece of information about a new or changed information asset ii determines based at least in part on the first piece of information a first characteristic of an ideal location for the information asset iii determines using a first locational schema a first characteristic of a first location in an information technology environment iv determines the compatibility of the information asset with the first location in an information technology environment by comparing the first characteristic of the ideal location to a first characteristic of the first location and v reports the compatibility to a user.

Some embodiments of the present disclosure present a method to i determine if the physical location of an information asset is compliant with pertinent security and information regulations ii determine if an information asset is placed in the right infrastructure zone based on security and compliance requirements iii provide advice to a user regarding the permissible locations for new information assets iv track and organize placement locations based on attributes which can be discovered dynamically or imported through data sources external to a primary asset focused data source v compute the right placement location for IT assets vi consider asset placement constraints as contributors from a living asset metadata and network and topology model and or vii consider the implication of placement or asset change.

The programs described herein are identified based upon the application for which they are implemented in a specific embodiment of the invention. However it should be appreciated that any particular program nomenclature herein is used merely for convenience and thus the invention should not be limited to use solely in any specific application identified and or implied by such nomenclature.

Processing begins at step S where discovery module mod scans an IT network for new or changed assets. The assets may be hardware assets such as server machines routers or storage devices software assets such as firmware virtual servers operating systems middleware software encryption software or office productivity applications or data assets such as customer or employee information business plans financial reports and so on. In general the assets may be any type or combination of types of assets fixed or mobile now known or to be developed that can be classified as IT assets and that are capable of being discovered and or monitored by a computer system. New assets are assets for which a placement analysis has not been performed by program while changed assets are assets that have changed since a prior analysis.

Discovery module collects information about the new or changed assets including properties such as asset name type version network address geographic location time in service and so on as applicable and as available for that asset. It also collects information regarding the relationship of the new asset s to each other and or to existing assets. For example new operating system X may be discovered on existing virtual server Y with a relationship that X runs on Y. In some cases at least a portion of discovery and or collection of certain information may be via manual entry by a user. In some embodiments at least a portion of the information is collected by sampling a subset of data and or networked assets rather than by an exhaustive search. In some cases independent discovery engines may be used which can be mutually operational and run along the lines of different things being discovered for example logical network placement using IP network analysis versus contiguity and placement analysis.

Processing proceeds to step S where asset mod adds or updates this information in an asset data store not shown . The asset data store accessed via asset mod retains both current and historic information about discovered assets which can be used in audits risk management analyses placement decisions and so forth.

Processing proceeds to step S where policy mod determines the characteristics of an ideal location for each new or changed asset. This assessment is based on information about or related to the asset as collected via discovery mod as already existing in the asset data store accessed via asset mod and or as determined via policy mod . For example suppose discovery mod discovers a new asset and determines that this asset is a database containing sensitive economic information about countries that are members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ASEAN this may be done using discoverable asset characteristics such as name type description Internet Protocol IP address node geolocation attributes and so on . This information is added to asset data store via asset mod . Policy mod then determines that because this is a sensitive asset concerning ASEAN countries there is a requirement that it be physically located in an ASEAN country. It further determines that because it will be accessed by external parties it belongs in a medium security zone. In general any number of factors may be considered including intrinsic characteristics such as type of hardware software or data and extrinsic qualities such as asset purpose use levels desired operating parameters consequences of compromise and applicable regulations obligations or organization policies. Moreover other software modules such as a metadata database may play a supporting role.

Processing proceeds to step S where locations mod determines the characteristics of the current location of each new or changed asset. It does this in part by maintaining location hierarchies and other information about locations and their relationships to each other. For example using relationship information discovered by discovery mod as well as information previously stored by asset mod it determines this new database asset is located on a particular physical server and that this physical server is in Jakarta. Locations mod maintains or has access to geographical and other information associated with locations so it can determine that Jakarta is in Indonesia and that Indonesia is in ASEAN. It also determines that the network address of the server is part of a 24 bit sub network subnet and that this subnet is part of the organization s e commerce security zone. In some embodiments and for some assets this step may be skipped because there is no current asset location instead the system is used prospectively to obtain a list of potential placement locations based on the characteristics determined in step S.

Processing proceeds to step S where analyzer mod determines the degree to which the current location of each new or changed asset is compatible with that asset. In the case of the new ASEAN database asset analyzer mod determines that the database is geographically situated in compliance with the requirement that it be in an ASEAN country and also that it is part of the correct security zone. In other cases it may determine that some characteristics of the asset location are less than ideal. In these cases analyzer mod will trigger locations mod to perform one or more searches for possible alternative locations for the asset. For example were analyzer mod to deem the current location of the ASEAN database inadequate on both fronts it would request locations mod to search for other locations that are part of the organization s e commerce or medium security zones and are geographically located in ASEAN countries. If none were found analyzer mod would request locations mod to expand its search to look for locations where either of the two conditions are true. In some embodiments this alternative search may not take place it may take place only if the degree of incompatibility surpasses a threshold or upon user request or it may take place even if the current location is found to be fully compatible. Compatibility may be assessed on a combined weighted basis of all factors considered or it may be assessed for each factor individually without combination.

Compatibility may not always be an either or proposition such as in the case of a single database for which some of the data is subject to one or more policies or requirements restricting the location where the data may be permissibly stored. In such a case the degree of compatibility may be based at least in part on the ratio of the quantity of data stored compliantly to the total quantity of data to which the policies and or requirements apply.

Processing proceeds to step S where user interface UI mod presents the results to a user. Compatibility is assessed on a factor by factor basis and presented to the user as such. Alternatively factors may be combined in some fashion with only an overall assessment value being presented. In some embodiments analyzer mod determines the most preferred location based on a single combined compatibility score and suggests that to the user through the user interface. User interface mod provides both a text and a graphic representation of the current location and its compatibility with each new or changed asset as well as showing the compatibility of various alternative locations. A user can also use UI mod to select the asset of interest or the details presented set configuration parameters such as display mode request a search for more alternative locations or perform various other tasks associated with the placement of IT assets. Here the user sees that the ASEAN database asset has been acceptably placed and decides no additional action is necessary.

As further illustration suppose that sometime later discovery mod discovers some change in the ASEAN database say that its average weekly load has surpassed some pre configured threshold for a period of so many days. Discovery mod reports this change to assets mod and policy mod in turn finds a policy stating that assets experiencing such a load should be located on a Fibre Channel network. Location mod determines that the current location of ASEAN database is not in such a location while analyzer mod determines that there are two existing locations that meet this requirement while also meeting the other two existing requirements for the ASEAN database which remain unchanged. These results are reported to the user via UI mod . UI mod uses a different graphical indicator for displaying compatibility of each location with each factor color for security zone shape for physical location and shading for network type. Alternatively other graphical indicators could be used such as size or position on the screen filtering could be applied so that a user can focus only on a subset of requirements at a time only overall compatibility could be indicated graphically and or text indicators could be provided to name a few alternatives. Through the process detailed above the system i alerts the user to IT infrastructure changes that possibly require further attention ii helps the user assess the specifics of the situation and iii helps the user determine possible alternatives.

This situation is depicted visually in . shows diagram representing a simplified view of part of networked computers system see . Each of locations represents a location in the network where the ASEAN database asset discussed above may be placed organized according to the three factors of interest above. For example seven locations in the diagram are located in an ASEAN country ASEAN countries . Five locations are located in e commerce zone . However only three locations and are both located in an ASEAN country and are in an e commerce zone. Location is the original fully compliant location of the ASEAN database. When the changed load statistic is reported and the Fibre Channel policy found to apply the system discovers that location is not compliant with this policy but finds four alternate locations that are on a Fibre Channel network . Two of these and are compliant with both this and the pre existing requirements for the ASEAN database location. Note that this is a current snapshot of the location landscape as maintained by locations mod for instance locations and may or may not have existed at the time the ASEAN database was originally added. Also note that had and not been found the system may have presented location as a possible alternative because while not meeting every requirement it is the only location found besides that meets two of the three and is therefore likely to be an alternate location candidate worthy of user assessment.

Some embodiments of the present disclosure recognize the following facts potential problems and or potential areas for improvement with respect to the current state of the art i it can be difficult to determine the proper placement of new information assets in the IT infrastructure because there is no method or tooling available computing permissible locations compliant with regulatory requirements for instance where legislation prevents the relocation of employee or customer information outside a country or region ii the type of the information asset may restrict the computing zone higher or lower security standards into which such an asset may be placed but again there is no method or tooling available to determine the appropriate location of an information asset with regard to its security requirements iii there is no method or tooling available to provide notification when an information asset requires relocation due to either increased security requirements or changed regulations iv the organizational structure of locational placement can be based on completely disjoint criteria for scalability and rapidity of asset or network management solution deployment the structure is often determined using some form of auto discovery of all or some subset of assets but the criteria for the organization of assets in the auto discovered structure should support operational refinement and evolution over time because the picture developed for locational structure alone is often incomplete at the time of discovery and or v federation of security and information availability means zone based designations such as geographic zones like countries may not be mutually exclusive but may have network presence which can be proxied or have differing security filtering to meet regulatory requirements on a distributed scale.

Some embodiments of the present disclosure recognize that for the above reasons i information assets are not always placed where they should be ii there is an incomplete view of the nature of information assets with respect to security and regulatory requirements and or iii manual efforts to manage information assets with respect to security and regulatory requirements are error prone and time consuming.

Some embodiments of the present disclosure recognize that while some CCMDBs store landscape information about IT assets such systems only possess a partial view of the information required to determine the ideal placement of IT assets. Similarly their auto discovery engines have limited if any capability with respect to locational containment or inferencing some of the various domains on a global network might have greater transparency richness of attribute data and discovery capabilities than other domains on the network for example . Likewise while some business glossaries store business related information for information assets such systems have only part of the information required to determine the ideal placement of those assets in the IT infrastructure.

Further they recognize that some SIEM tools have the ability to build up a topology of managed network devices such as routers firewalls and switches based on a transformational analysis of device configurations processed through a common network information model. The result is a locational organization which can be used for simulations of security threats operational analyses of firewall filters and other applications. The primary device criteria however are entirely network and network configuration based. While there are a number of ways to launch a discovery capability for managed assets systems and while containment in the user interface is semi automatically managed that is an approach through the user interface that allows for semi automated human input based placements with the topology and its display and formatting being data driven based upon the discovery of both initial configurations and changes deletions in the underlying network nothing is provided in terms of placement analytics that produce fully automated placement analyses and suggestions.

Still further they recognize that some IIG systems can scan a network and discover database servers and if given credentials can scan a database and use heuristics and regular expressions to determine if there is sensitive data stored therein. They can then look at generic policies that should be applicable. However they have no notion of location whether geographic or in terms of network zones.

Some embodiments of the present disclosure include an information asset placer that is implemented entirely in software or in a combination of software and hardware. In some embodiments where the information asset placer is built entirely in software it can also be added as a component to existing software.

In some embodiments of the present disclosure the information asset placer possesses the following characteristics functions and or abilities 

 i acquisition of assets such as elements of hardware software processes or significant data storage via a dynamic discovery b entry though an administrative user interface and or c importation through some foreign data source such as a catalog service interface from an external asset management system 

 ii a user interface for a user to perform functions such as entering or refining the attributes of an information asset classifying its specific application type and identifying applicable regulations preferred deployment platforms operating system database application server and so forth and security zone classification 

 iii base location relationships that are created as part of the framework for the deployment of the system under a policy for location creation placement and creation of location hierarchies which will constitute the building blocks of asset placement decisions 

 iv base location relationships that regard factors such as physical geography network placement and or broad vicinity group containment notions in governing conformance schemes 

 v the ability to place assets in locational containers that represent the union or intersection of equivalence classes of one or more classification hierarchies for example an asset might be placed in northern United Kingdom and in subnet 76.112.0.0 16 

 vi in addition to being able to access the location policies and relationships of iii and iv the ability to interface with CCMDB business glossary and other such systems to read necessary information regarding details on regulations security zones and the like over the course of an asset s life cycle this ability provides data to be considered during discovery or reconciliations from asset moves adds changes providing the asset lifetime aspect of the system and the operational value gained from it 

 vii identification of possible placement locations based on the influencing parameters derived from the security and regulatory requirements that apply to an asset 

 viii visualization for the user of the locations of vii with maps of the IT landscape coloring areas where the information asset may be permissibly placed the base s of which were derived from the locational creation in iii whereby the user can the select a location in cases where multiple placement location options are available 

 ix for existing information assets registered with the solution the ability to create alerts notifying users if changes in security requirements and or regulations require a relocation of an information asset along with suggestions for the new location 

 x for initial deployment of the solution a bulk processing method allowing the importation of all IT assets registered in systems like a CCMDB 

 xi the ability to access additional information sources like a business glossary in order to correlate existing IT assets with their applicable regulations 

 xii the ability to process information assets to determine whether or not their current locations are acceptable and or

Some embodiments of the present disclosure may include one or more of the following features characteristics and or advantages i improved compliance of IT assets with respect to their geographic location ii improved security because more sensitive assets will be placed in areas with higher security iii reduced manual work figuring out where IT assets should be located and or iv unification of the discovery of assets their locations and moves and changes to those asset placements together with the regulatory and compliance aspects of those asset placements and changes.

Shown in is system an example embodiment of an asset placement solution architecture for an information asset placer system. System includes CCMDB metadata database discovery profiling and monitoring component asset location manager and analyzer location manager information asset placer user interface catalog of regulations and security requirements and IT infrastructure IT environment containing four security zones with each zone containing one or more distinct geographic locations within it. The zones of IT infrastructure are trusted zone where mission critical corporate systems should be located medium zone for hosting non core applications demilitarized zone for e commerce solutions and non trusted zone where development and test processes may take place.

CCMDB provides an inventory of the IT systems in an enterprise in order to perform tasks like configuration and change management. It feeds information asset placer with move add change MAC events for IT assets throughout their life cycles. CCMDB has crawler spider algorithms that scan the IT environment for new systems as well as detect upgrades or changes to the software footprints of existing systems. CCMDB seeds the framework from which location manager develops its base model see below .

Each asset tracked in CCMDB is represented by a configuration item CI . A CI s properties include values such as asset name hostname IP address location type of system software version CPU numbers and other such information. A CI also contains information about how the asset correlates with other assets. For example a business system providing the function of corporate email might be composed of a set of IT assets that includes a business system name Corporate Email which contains a computer system name EmailServer1 mem 4 GB CPUs 2 an operating system name OpSys1 ver 3.13 that is installedOn and runsOn this computer system an application server that runsOn this operating system an application that is deployedTo this application server and that uses some database server name DBServer1 and so on. This is a brief example of the types of attributes each CI could contain and the ways in which CIs could be related.

Metadata database contains business technical and operational metadata. Business metadata such as a classification of business terms and their definitions as they relate to information processed within a company is stored in metadata database . On the next level business objects and logical data models can be associated with the business terms as well as additional information on the business object such as applicable regulations. On the next level physical table definitions can be attached to the logical data models and the name type of system where these tables and models are actually implemented. For instance for a business object like customer there might be multiple table definitions for several systems in an enterprise that process customer information.

Discovery profiling and monitoring component provides capabilities to discover data models within a system and mappings between models in the same or different systems. If a model is identified to hold sensitive information in one system and a similar looking model is found in another system which has not yet been classified this could be a first indication that this other system might hold sensitive information as well. Another set of capabilities provided by this component are data profiling and data quality monitoring functions. In the context of this disclosure the intent is usually not to do full data profiling and data quality monitoring across all of the data stored in the various IT systems but rather to perform a data sampling to identify whether or not new tables or existing tables contain sensitive information. For example it is relatively easy to set up rules for data profiling to detect if the values in a field follow typical patterns such as those found with i social security numbers SSN ii tax IDs iii credit card numbers demographic information such as gender age religion marital status and the like and or iv address information. If for instance address information is discovered an analysis can be done against country reference data sets to determine to which country the address belongs and in turn which privacy and security regulations may apply .

By regularly performing this type of monitoring on data samples in various systems it is possible to detect if existing systems have been modified or new systems have been added to hold sensitive information. This component knows about all tables in all systems via the metadata managed by metadata database . Also if the tables are linked to business metadata indicating that a table supposedly has sensitive or only non sensitive information this component can place notifications to the authoring user interface of metadata database whether or not the business metadata is accurate in this respect.

Catalog of regulations and security requirements includes a reference catalog of regulations which can import export regulations expressed in policies that can be enforced. This catalog includes information about whether or not stored information assets are permitted to be physically moved across country borders. For example some countries in Europe do not permit personal information to be moved outside of the home country of the person to which the information pertains or permit such a move only with the explicit written permission of the information owner. Catalog also has out of the box a complete catalog of security capabilities linked up to security requirements so that information asset placer can query them and a user can select which ones should be enforced and are applicable in which trust zone of IT environment . Catalog has geographic locations for the IT buildings and trust zone classifications available as well.

Turning momentarily to the solution architecture for location manager can be seen. Location manager includes asset location database asset location assignment engine and location policy engine which contains catalog of locational and location grouping relationship attributes and management policy location catalog hierarchies along with location query mechanisms and location analysis and attribute correleation . also shows IT assets through and IT assets through

Location catalog hierarchies seeds the base schema for locations. This schema is the building block of the locational assignment of assets individually or in aggregate. The specifications contained in location catalog hierarchies include the locations themselves and the locational schema s along with certain points for location manager operations with respect to the management of those locations or the assets being placed into them see below .

The locations themselves can be individually entered or obtained through an external data source query of discrete location levels they can also be assigned as broad references to other schemas such as by continent country major city designated marketing area DMA all public and or private IP networks by specified prefix length such as 24 or 24 bit domain name server DNS name domain name by matching regular expressions or any other method of assignment supported by the system.

Each location or location grouping has assigned mechanisms to determine asset placement to that containment level. For example assets for a given location or grouping may be matched by results from a Simple Network Management Protocol SNMP sysLocation query or a procedure to query on asset data or a proxy network manager. They may also be matched in other ways such as via attributes capable of being queried for location from a Representational State Transfer REST application programming interface API call to an asset agent then using the API of a map application to map that attribute to an exact location. Raw geographic data could come from a geolocation sensor on the chassis of a device for example which could then be converted to a map topological look from a map API lookup seeded from that geolocation data. Knowing the physical location of an asset can pinpoint say which specific data center or data center area the assets are in or should be in . Mapping APIs can be used for visual presentation of this information to a user. These mechanisms can be specified at the root level for inheritance to all other points along that catalog hierarchy.

While some locational schema may have semantically clear relationships based on the schema for instance Los Angeles Portland and Seattle all resolve to a higher containment of Western United States others may require that the relationships be established to a non obvious higher level containment factor particularly when the containment level is specified in a solution deployment specific way for example all longitude latitude values matching a criteria map resolve to a containment of Central Management Zone for say the management of physical infrastructure such as a smart electricity grid .

Finally the thresholds and predispositions for decomposition elaboration into a nested level can be specified for points in the catalog hierarchy either by direct attribute or by threshold such as once more than 10 assets have been identified in this 16 subnet do automatic breakdown into contained 24 sub networks for scalability hereinafter referred to as Example Rule 1 .

Location manager determines the containment at the placement location level into which assets are placed when they are discovered or introduced into the system. It is geared around automation of placement into locational containers and the automated decomposition and aggregation of those containers by hierarchical relationships between containment levels. The structure instance identification and rules for the decomposition and other evolutionary processes on these locational containment instances and their boundaries are contributed by location catalog hierarchies component discussed above.

The locational containment relationships multiple because they may be multi valued per asset or class of assets as realized through location manager can seed a map or other similarly depicted user interface for aggregate viewing of assets their locations and their current and past placements.

Where an asset whether by tag serial number data signature or the like can be determined to have changed location through the moves and changes portion of an asset discovery piece such as that of CCMDB see as discussed above or simply through the explicit change in administrative asset data or the values obtained from an imported asset database that change triggers locational analysis in the location manager. It is reintroduced into the location containment model but with traceability as to its prior point of containment. This provides an important trigger for the coupled information asset placer for its own placement analysis see below along with the context for any placement decision alerts.

Returning to for each known asset in IT environment captured in CCMDB information asset placer determines where within IT environment the asset should be placed. When making this determination information asset placer considers the following factors i geographic location ii trust zone iii security requirements iv regulatory requirements v data sensitivity results as determined by discovery profiling and monitoring component and vi metadata from metadata database . The metadata from metadata database includes information assets resulting from linking models and the assets they contain or that contain them to terms along with information about the security and regulatory policies and other policies attached to those assets.

Shown in is screenshot illustrating some of the capabilities of user interface UI of information asset placer . Screenshot includes new systems bucket existing systems bucket details canvas and locations pane . If CCMDB see detects a new system a To Do item appears in new systems bucket . If a change is detected such as a change of the system stack detected by CCMDB or a change of the data sensitivity status found by discovery profiling and monitoring component an alert is created in existing systems bucket . For each To Do item as well as for each alert a user can open up the details for the system and see all relevant information in details canvas . Finally locations pane shows a user the current location of the selected system as well as other possible locations for the system. By using different shapes for current location square and possible locations circles as well as color codes indicating if the current location is OK green or not OK red it is easy for the user to understand if the selected system is placed in a compliant fashion or not note if were in color the box labeled US in locations pane would be red while those labeled DE and CH would be green .

UI also has additional capabilities that are not shown in screenshot . These include the ability to set configuration options for information asset placer including i whether or not to automatically trigger discovery and profiling if CCMDB finds a new system ii whether or not to automatically trigger profiling if CCMDB detects an upgrade and iii whether a single monitoring frequency is to be used for all systems or set on a per system basis. Through UI a user can also perform such tasks as requesting ad hoc profiling activity setting monitoring frequency and depth that is size of data types of tests and so on reviewing regulations and attaching detaching them from the system and reviewing security policies and attaching detaching them from the system.

Shown in is algorithm framework supporting information asset placer . In step S the exploration component of CCMDB see runs periodically or on request to determine whether there are any new or changed IT assets in IT environment . Discovery profiling and monitoring component is also run periodically or on request step S to profile any associated data models and the data they contain. If a new IT asset is detected step S the item is added to the To Do list of information asset placer and discovery profiling and monitoring component is triggered to run against the newly discovered asset s . If a change is detected to an existing IT asset by either CCMDB or discovery profiling and monitoring component step S an alert is generated for that asset in information asset placer . Data related to the new or changed IT asset s is then collected in step S from all the various information sources including metadata database and catalog of regulations and security requirements .

A number of key performance indicators KPIs are computed from this data in step S. These KPIs include a sensitivity KPI S KPI which measures if the data found is or is not sensitive. Sensitive data fields are fields like social security numbers credit card numbers and so on which often need special protection such as being stored only in an encrypted fashion or requiring higher privileges to access. The S KPI measures how many rows provide a value for the field and how many are stored with the special protections they require like whether they are stored in an encrypted or a non encrypted fashion . The S KPI is not a 0 1 score because the profiling is done on a data sample and perhaps only some fraction of the data is found to be compliant. For example a particular column of data fields containing sensitive data such as social security numbers may have been found compliant for only 40 of the values sampled.

Other KPIs include i a regulation KPI R KPI which provides an indication of the potential legal and business risks associated with any regulatory non compliance detected the risk factor can be configured by the user ii a security KPI Sec KPI which scores any security policies associated with the system to provide insight regarding in which trust zone a system should be placed trusted zone DMZ non trusted zone and so forth and iii a metadata KPI M KPI which determines how relevant and accurate the metadata found in metadata database is for classification of the system one factor considered is if a sensitive attribute is found in metadata database for a table in the system for which the latest profiling results have contradicting information the metadata is flagged as being outdated . In various alternative embodiments other KPIs may be computed instead of or in addition to the four KPIs described here.

Once all the KPIs are determined they are accumulated to a total score using weights which are configurable by the user. The attributes governing sensitivity regulatory considerations security attributes and metadata for the asset placement decisions can be seen as joined data overlays on the part of the locations as exposed and processed through asset location manager and analyzer itself. This is to say these attributes are not intrinsic to the core definition of the location itself but are part of the usage of those locations in the applications driving the KPI determinations. Location manager doesn t inherently incorporate all of the attributes of locational interest or the semantics for all possible stakeholder applications such as the specific regulatory attributes found in catalog of regulations and security requirements used by information asset placer into its data model. Rather a model joining the core location attributes and those for each realm of asset regulatory sensitivity security concern and so on is used though in some embodiments all of these attributes may be incorporated into the location manager component .

The KPIs and total score are then used to make asset location decisions suggestions in steps S and S as follows. First a result for the current location of the system is determined. For instance the current geographic location of the system and or its network location both of which are intrinsic location attributes if maintained are compared against the profile of the trust zone it should be in considering the S KPI and Sec KPI results. If any mismatch is found the system is marked as being placed in the wrong location.

Second a determination of possible new locations is made based on details of the KPIs such as the S KPI and Sec KPI and information available in catalog of regulations . If no location is found which is completely compliant one or more of the closest matches are presented. Influencing factors and the rule system used include i if addresses are found from countries for which data privacy regulations demand data to be within the country unless written permission to move it elsewhere has been obtained from the information owner these countries are put onto a candidate list of potential new locations for the asset ii the candidate list then is compared to the company s IT locations and any country on the candidate list for which the company does not have an IT location is removed from the list and iii a IT locations are scanned for available trust zones where the zones map to single locations or an aggregation of multiple locations as tracked and processed by asset location manager b the available trust zones at an IT location for a country on the candidate list are then compared to the trust zone level required by the system being classified and c if a trust zone level appropriate for the system being placed is found that trust zone at the IT location in that country on the candidate list is flagged as a possible location. Other factors and rules may be included in other embodiments.

Some embodiments of the present disclosure recognize that the final judgment about where an IT asset should be placed is usually a human decision. Therefore these embodiments will typically be used as smart advisor tools for an IT manager architect administrator. For example an analysis may be required to re implement a master data management MDM solution with a federated architecture and appropriate filters on the services layer across multiple databases physically located in the countries where data privacy regulations demand the data to be physically stored. Alerting a user to the possibility that their data may be subject to such regulations and providing an indication of the legal and or business costs associated with non compliance can motivate the user to take appropriate action and can provide support for any resulting decision. This decision along with documentation of the reasoning behind it can be attached to the information asset placer system in some embodiments of the present disclosure. These embodiments therefore not only help to manage compliance and security better but also make decisions in this regard more transparent and auditable.
