This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 748 851 filed on Jan. 4 2013 entitled METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR FINGERPRINT TEMPLATE ENROLLMENT AND DISTRIBUTION PROCESS the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety.

A computing device such as a desktop laptop or smartphone can perform biometric user authentication in several steps. Initially a user enrolls with the biometric user authentication system by binding their user credentials with the user s biometric template a fingerprint template in specific implementations . The biometric template contains information related to the user s biometric characteristics also referred to as biometric information obtained from a biometric sensor that scans or reads the user s biometric characteristics such as a fingerprint. A user identification process identifies a particular user among multiple enrolled users e.g. multiple users enrolled with a particular device system or biometric sensor . A user verification process verifies that the user who provides their biometric information is who they claim to be by comparing the user s biometric information with the biometric template obtained during enrollment of that user.

For some service providers such as service providers relating to payment for goods or services the enrollment process is usually critical. Often regulations dictate what can and cannot be done during the payment process. The Know Your Customer KYC and Anti Money Laundering AML rules require a strong verification of the identity of the person claiming to be the owner of an account payment instruments etc. This verification is typically performed by an accredited facility such as by a banking agency by a telecommunications store or by other means of physically verifying the documents provided by the person. Specifically the identity of the person is matched e.g. by a clerk to an officially issued or recognized government document.

The steps taken to identify an individual can be bypassed or may even fail by clever hatted personalities. For example someone may provide identification from a foreign country that a clerk cannot confirm with certainty the genuine nature of the document.

This process is typically possible at a government level by matching the identity of a person to data in an automated fingerprint identification system AFIS database. Performing this authentication on a consumer s computing device however is often much more challenging. This authentication may be performed on the consumer s computing device via a one time enrollment to a service with the clerk verifying some documentation and maybe authorizing the provisioning of a payment instrument linked to the now locally created fingerprint template.

However when a fingerprint template is created it is typically stored only within that specific computing device. Thus this step is usually performed only once. Users do not want to have to return to the facility in order to enroll and create a template on another device. Further users do not want to carry all of their devices into the facility at the same time in order to enroll and validate the user on all of his or her devices. Additionally users change devices on a regular basis which heightens this problem further.

The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for extrapolating a unique identifier from a template that can then be stored in a remote database and still be used across other devices. If someone hacks the remote database the most common hack then only a list of identifiers with no meaning can be seen which will be understood to protect such locally stored e.g. on the user device s e.g. a trusted master device or one of a number of trusted master devices such items as e.g. source details.

In one aspect a method and system include a database including a user bucket and a device bucket. The user bucket includes an identifier for each verified user in a plurality of verified users and the device bucket includes an identifier for each verified device in a plurality of verified devices. An interpreter and bucket matcher determines an identifier to transmit to a first device based on a known template of an existing user in the plurality of verified users or based on a known device in the plurality of verified devices.

The interpreter and bucket matcher further transmits the identifier to a second device known in the plurality of verified devices after the second device switches into a secure mode and to enable the second device to receive a template via a proxy channel from the first device.

A system and method are disclosed which may comprise providing a database comprising a user list and a user device list the user list comprising a list of one or more user biometric identifiers each user biometric identifier extracted from and unique to a respective template of a user biometric of a verified user and the user device list comprising a list of one or more user biometric identifiers each extracted from and unique to a respective template of a user biometric of a verified user device associated with the verified user and determining via an interpreter matcher one of 1 whether a user biometric identifier of a known user biometric received from an unverified user device matches a user biometric identifier on the user device list to verify the unverified user device and 2 whether a user biometric identifier extracted from and unique to a new user biometric template received from a verified user device matches a user biometric identifier in the stored user list to verify the new user biometric template.

The system and method may further comprise the template of the user biometric comprising information relating to the biometric characteristics of a user biometric sensed by a trusted user biometric image sensor. The template of the user biometric may be created in the trusted biometric image extractor sensor. The service provider database may be connected to a service provider server. Verifying a new user device may add the new user device to the user device list in the service provider database comprising a cluster of user devices associated with the user. Verifying the new user biometric template may add to the user list in the service provider database another user biometric associated with the user. The user biometric identifier may be an encrypted version of the user biometric template.

A system and method is disclosed which may comprise storing in a service provider database a user list and a user device list the user list comprising a list of one or more user biometric identifiers each user biometric identifier extracted from and unique to a respective template of a user biometric of a verified user and the user device list comprising list of one or more user biometric identifiers each extracted from and unique to a respective template of a user biometric of a verified user device associated with the verified user and determining via an interpreter matcher whether a user biometric identifier extracted from and unique to a new user biometric template received from a verified user device matches a user biometric identifier in the stored user list to verify the new user biometric template and authorizing a verified user device containing a stored master template identified by the user biometric identifier contained in the user list to transfer to the user device which transmitted the verified new user biometric template a verified master template to create a new root of trust and user biometric identifier for storage in the user list and the user device list.

The system and method may comprise wherein the transfer is accomplished by way of a short range wireless network. The short range wireless network may be one of a Bluetooth wireless BT wifi Bluetooth low energy BLE and or near field communication NFC network.

The systems and methods described herein relate to biometric authentication of users. Biometrics and biometric information refers to measurable biological characteristics of a user such as a fingerprint facial characteristics eye characteristics voice characteristics also referred to as a voiceprint and the like. As discussed herein biometric information provides an additional level of security when used in systems and procedures related to authentication of a user.

Particular examples discussed herein use fingerprint biometric information to authenticate one or more users. In other embodiments any type of biometric information may be used instead of fingerprint information. Additionally a particular embodiment may utilize multiple types of biometric information e.g. fingerprints and voiceprints to authenticate a user. Certain described embodiments include an application to swipe style fingerprint sensors. However as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art alternate embodiments may include any type of fingerprint sensor such as a placement sensor. In some embodiments the biometric sensor is configurable such that it is physically attached to or manufactured into a client device such as a computer electronic device cellular phone tablet and so forth. In other embodiments the biometric sensor is a portable device that is coupleable to the client device e.g. a pluggable USB device for enrollment and or authentication procedures. Coupleable devices are configurable to provide temporary sensor capability and to enable a sensor to be used for a plurality of devices.

As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art a web application a web based application and a web enabled application includes a software application or software routine that is capable of communicating with one or more web servers or similar devices via the Internet or other data communication network. Additionally a plug in or a browser plug in includes an application or extension that provides a variety of different features and functions. Particular examples of plug ins and browser plug ins discussed herein provide features and functions related to user authentication while for example accessing web sites making secure transactions and the like. In particular embodiments the browser plug in is installed as part of the manufacturing process of devices equipped with associated biometric devices. In specific implementations the browser plug in is operable with any biometric device that supports the Windows Biometric Framework or other supported architectures or systems.

Typical passwords do not provide any physical authentication of the user s identity. Thus any person or machine can access a user s Web based accounts and related information if they gain knowledge of the user s password and username. Using biometric information in the user authentication process provides an increased level of security by authenticating physical characteristics of the user. Thus an imposter with the correct password but lacking the required physical characteristics will not be authenticated by the system.

Initially a user enrolls with the biometric user authentication system by binding their user credentials with the user s biometric template a fingerprint template in specific implementations . The biometric template contains information related to the user s biometric characteristics also referred to as biometric information obtained from a biometric sensor that scans or reads the user s biometric characteristics such as a fingerprint. A user identification process identifies a particular user among multiple enrolled users e.g. multiple users enrolled with a particular device system or biometric sensor . A user verification process verifies that the user who provides their biometric information is who they claim to be by comparing the user s biometric information with the biometric template obtained during enrollment of that user. The enrollment identification and verification of users is discussed in greater detail herein.

During an example enrollment process that uses a fingerprint sensor as the biometric sensor a user swipes their finger across the fingerprint sensor several times to create a fingerprint template. The fingerprint template contains qualitative fingerprint information that allows the user s fingerprint to be distinguished from fingerprints associated with other users. In alternate embodiments a placement fingerprint sensor also referred to as a static fingerprint sensor is used such that a user places their finger on the fingerprint sensor rather than swiping their finger across the fingerprint sensor. After creating a fingerprint template the user or a web server or other system provides user credentials such as a password cryptographic key random seed and the like. The systems and procedures described herein bind the user s fingerprint template with the user credentials. The fingerprint template and user credentials are then stored in a secure storage device. In one embodiment the secure storage device is contained within the fingerprint sensor hardware. In other embodiments the secure storage device is contained in a device that utilizes the fingerprint sensor.

During an example user identification process also referred to as a user verification process a user swipes their finger across a fingerprint sensor. The process then determines whether the user s fingerprint information matches a fingerprint template associated with the fingerprint sensor. If the user s fingerprint information matches a fingerprint template the user s credentials are released to the user and or a service or process requesting the user verification. Thus the user credentials are not released from the secure storage device until a matching fingerprint template is confirmed. In particular embodiments the user credentials released as a result of a match with a fingerprint template are not necessarily the same credentials provided by the user during the enrollment process. For example the user credentials released after finding a matching fingerprint template may include an OTP One Time Password token RSA signature and the like. The enrollment process can be initiated by a Web server a Web browser plug in and the like.

The described systems and methods communicate user credentials to a specific address location or other recipient identifier. Thus even if an imposter can gain access to the user credentials the system will send those user credentials to a predetermined address or location thereby preventing the imposter from attempting to have the user credentials sent to an alternate address or location. The address or location information is stored within the user credentials and is established as part of the enrollment process.

Particular embodiments of the systems and methods discussed herein use strong cryptographic algorithms implemented in hardware and or software. Example cryptographic algorithms include AES Advanced Encryption Standard 256 SHA Secure Hash Algorithm 256 and RSA 2048. Example biometric sensors are compatible with various standards such as OATH OCRA OATH Challenge Response Algorithms TOPT Time based One time Password Algorithm HOPT HMAC Based OTP Algorithm and PKCS Public Key Cryptography Standards 11 RSA SecureID based OTP and the like.

In one embodiment each biometric sensor has a unique identifier ID that is used to strengthen the level of security provided by the system or process. This unique ID provides an additional authentication factor representing something you have . Since each biometric sensor has a unique ID each user s biometric template and user credentials can be uniquely associated with a specific biometric sensor.

Specific implementations include a biometric sensor as part of a multi component or multi element authentication system. Particular embodiments may include one or more authentication factors such as 1. something you are 2. something you have and 3. something you know.

In example embodiments a web site that supports the authentication procedures discussed herein includes an HTML Hyper Text Markup Language tag that identifies a web browser plug in also referred to as a biometric plug in that is installed on the user s computing device. This HTML tag indicates to the browser that the web site supports biometric authentication. Other example embodiments include an extension of an existing web browser plug in. Further implementations may utilize a browser helper object ActiveX control Browser Extension or other approaches. In particular implementations the web browser plug in obtains the biometric sensor s unique ID and communicates that unique ID or a hash of the unique ID to a web server via HTTP or HTTPS.

When a user accesses the web site the web browser plug in is activated and detects that a biometric sensor is installed in the user s computing device. The web site suggests that the user enroll with their biometric sensor to provide a more secure user authentication. If the user accepts the web browser plug in activates the enrollment process to enroll the user. This enrollment process includes binding the web site to the specific user. The web site then generates a secret key and passes the secret key to the user s computing device via a secure connection between the web site and the user s computing device. In a particular implementation the enrollment process includes enrolling the user s fingerprint and generating a secret key.

If the user also wants to bind their computing device with web site authentication the web browser plug in sends the biometric sensor s ID to the web site server or other device system. Multiple embodiments store information in various formats and on various devices or components within a system. Example embodiments may utilize a hash of the shared secret a hash of the biometric sensor ID and the like. At this point the user can select different factors for authentication. In a particular embodiment the web site may require stronger authentication when an important operation is being performed on the web site such as accessing a bank account or other sensitive data.

After a user has enrolled with a particular web site that supports biometric authentication subsequent visits to the same web site cause the web browser plug in to detect that the user has already enrolled with the web site. In this situation the web site prompts the user to perform user authentication e.g. using the biometric device . In the case of a fingerprint sensor the user swipes their finger across the fingerprint sensor or places their finger on the fingerprint sensor. If the fingerprint information matches a fingerprint template associated with the fingerprint sensor the web browser plug in releases user secrets from the user credentials. In particular embodiments the fingerprint sensor releases an OTP token or an RSA signature instead of plaintext credentials. After the credentials are released they are communicated to the web site to complete the user authentication process. In specific implementations the server may generate a random challenge and communicate that challenge to the client device. The web browser plug in or the biometric sensor uses this challenge to construct a response based on the secure key and the random challenge. The response may be a hash of the secure key a hash of the random challenge or any other calculation. The server validates the user credentials and authenticates the user if the validation is successful.

In particular implementations the user performs the enrollment process for each web site the user accesses that supports biometric authentication. Additionally different user credentials are associated with each web site with which the user enrolls. Thus if the user enrolls with five different web sites that support biometric authentication the biometric sensor in the user s computing device stores five separate sets of user credentials each of which is associated with one of the five different web sites. Additionally if different users access the same web site separate user credentials and separate biometric templates are maintained for each user.

Particular embodiments of the web browser plug in support WBF Windows Biometric Framework thereby supporting any biometric device that supports the WBF interface. The web browser plug in also supports the Application Programming Interface specified by the BioAPI Consortium.

In alternate embodiments the systems and methods determine that a web site supports biometric authentication by providing a service or process that monitors web site data and detects certain types of transactions on secure web sites. When a secure transaction is initiated the systems and methods check the computing device accessing the web site to determine if the computing device includes a fingerprint sensor or other biometric device. If so an enrollment and or authentication process is activated to offer an enhanced level of security to the user as described herein.

In a particular embodiment application is an Internet browser application executing on host PC and communicating with various web servers via the Internet. Application includes a browser extension or browser plug in that communicates with biometric service . In one implementation biometric service is a secure application executing in a background mode on host PC . Thus biometric service provides a communication interface to biometric sensor . The browser extension or browser plug in associated with application is capable of communicating transaction details random challenges signature information user information and other data to biometric service . Biometric service also communicates with one or more web servers as part of the user enrollment and or user authentication procedure.

As described above to have a user validated based on regulations the verification in an accredited facility such as a bank is necessary. When verification occurs at such an accredited facility a master template is created. However when a fingerprint template is created it is typically stored only within that specific computing device. In one embodiment a user s fingerprint template in a first computing device is copied and transmitted to a second computing device e.g. via near field communication or secured Wi Fi or Bluetooth .

Leveraging the secure element in the fingerprint sensor e.g. sensor a Physical Unclonable Function PUF and some unique silicon marking is the trusted part of the system. With mobile computing devices such as smartphones a Trusted Execution Environment TEE can be used to switch the sensor driver into the Secure OS execution mode. The TEE is a secure area that resides in the main processor of a mobile computing device e.g. smartphone and ensures that sensitive data is stored processed and protected in a trusted environment. The TEE s ability to offer safe execution of authorized security software known as trusted applications enables it to provide end to end security by enforcing protection confidentiality integrity and data access rights. The TEE isolates secure applications and keeps them away from any malware which might be downloaded inadvertently.

The master template can then be packaged in such a way to be copied and transmitted securely to a second computing device. Using the same mechanism on the second computing device the template prime is now created and stored. This template is bound to the trusted or verified sensor in the second computing device.

In one embodiment the root of trust is at the level of the sensor capturing the fingerprint. With PUF Real time clock Silicon serial number ROM many elements of the device or sensor itself can be leveraged to uniquely mark the template and create an actual binding between the device and the user.

If someone can lift a fingerprint in a targeted attack and try to replay it on a new device the binding between that template and the sensor won t be present. At that point a verification trigger will occur because of the need to enroll again on a new computing device with a supposedly known fingerprint. This is when the computing device pings a remote database e.g. of a server computer or in the cloud for a unique identifier to verify with the user if this is a legitimate request.

A user can scan his or her finger on the original device to validate the new enrollment and then the new device will know which identifier to ping in the future and from a consumer point of view the friction is minimal. Multi device enrollment can be done from this single verified enrollment performed in a facility.

In one embodiment service providers refer to this as a bucket list. In order to provide consistency across platforms and to maintain security for remote access a bucket of known devices associated with a user is set and a bucket of known users on a single device is also set. Now multiple identifiers can be dropped in any of the buckets and can or cannot be linked with each other. This makes it more difficult for a hacker to trace back the user device that is the root of trust. And the more devices a user binds to her fingerprint the more roots of trust verification are created. If one device is not registered in the bucket anymore and a new device is about to be added the user bucket can make a call to another known device in that user bucket.

In one embodiment the interpreter bucket matcher stores the identifier in a user bucket and associates the identifier with the user e.g. a user s finger 1 e.g. thumb finger 2 e.g. index finger finger 3 e.g. ring finger etc. . The interpreter bucket matcher can also store the identifier in a device bucket and associates the identifier with Consumer Device A .

Suppose that the user now wants to use a new second computing device Consumer Device B which is unverified. The template is known as this is the same user. The known template is transmitted to the cryptographic engine . The interpreter bucket matcher transmits Step the identifier to the Consumer Device B. The identifier is associated with the user and is retrieved from the user bucket . This identifier is transmitted to the cryptographic engine with the known template . Thus the new Consumer Device B has been binded to an existing user.

In another embodiment a known device Consumer Device C is being binded to a new user finger. A new template is retrieved by the device and transmitted to a cryptographic engine . The interpreter bucket matcher transmits the identifier for the known device from the device bucket to the Consumer Device C Step . The identifier is transmitted to the cryptographic engine with the new template to bind the new user to the Consumer Device C .

In one embodiment a new second device Consumer Device B with a trusted fingerprint sensor requests to be verified by database . The second device is switched into a secure mode remote or TEE . This device is then verified and the interpreter bucket matcher transmits Step the identifier to the device . A template is transmitted to Consumer Device B from Consumer Device A via a proxy channel like near field communication NFC .

For example a cell phone may include a numeric keypad or a display of limited functionality such as a monochrome liquid crystal display LCD for displaying text pictures etc. In contrast however as another example a web enabled client device may include one or more physical or virtual keyboards mass storage one or more accelerometers one or more gyroscopes global positioning system GPS or other location identifying type capability of a display with a high degree of functionality such as a touch sensitive color 2D or 3D display for example.

Moreover a consumer device may also include or execute an application to perform a variety of possible tasks such as browsing searching playing various forms of content including locally stored or streamed video or games such as fantasy sports leagues .
