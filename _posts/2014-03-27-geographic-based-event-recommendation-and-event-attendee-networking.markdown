Embodiments of the present disclosure relate generally to online social networking and more particularly but not by way of limitation to geographic based event recommendation and attendee networking.

The near ubiquity of mobile devices and wireless networks provides users with access to information virtually anywhere. For example users of social network services such as LinkedIn may access social networking information via mobile devices. In addition mobile devices often provide a variety of information using device sensors such as current location.

The description that follows includes systems methods techniques instruction sequences and computing machine program products that embody illustrative embodiments of the disclosure. In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide an understanding of various embodiments of the inventive subject matter. It will be evident however to those skilled in the art that embodiments of the inventive subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In general well known instruction instances protocols structures and techniques have not been shown in detail.

In various example embodiments systems and methods for recommending events based on geographic location information and facilitating event attendee networking are described. In an example embodiment location information e.g. as determined by a global positioning system GPS component of a mobile device corresponding to a member of a social network service may be used to determine suggested events e.g. a developer conference a sporting event a concert and the like . For instance events that are within a distance of the user may be identified and recommended to the user. In some example embodiments a user specified distance may be used to determine the suggested events. Event information corresponding to the suggested event may be presented to the user. The event information may comprise a wide variety of information including an event description e.g. event name event location event topic event speakers event activities event duration event price and so forth number of event attendees a list of event attendees an attendee summary contact members of the user attending the event and other event information event parking public transportation options handicap accessible weather forecast for the event location and time and so forth .

In various example embodiments a user attendance indication may be received from the user. The user attendance indication may indicate that the user is attending the suggested event. In some example embodiments the user attendance indication may be received in response to an attendance trigger. For example the attendance trigger may be the user moving within a distance of the suggested event e.g. the user entering the building hosting the event may trigger the attendance indication . In further example embodiments the user may provide member attendance indications for other members of the social network e.g. the user may be accompanied by other members of the social network service and may provide attendance indications for the group .

In an example embodiment contact members of the user e.g. friends of the user on the social network service may be identified and provided with an event notification that indicates the user is attending the suggested event. The event notification may include the event information and may facilitate the contact member in attending the suggested event. In some example embodiments the event notification may only be presented to the contact members within a distance of the suggested event e.g. only provide the notification to nearby contact members . Similarly additional contact members of the original contact members may be provided the event notification if the original contact member attends the suggested event and provides an indication of attendance. In this way awareness of the suggested event may spread via social contacts.

In a further example embodiment attendee members attending the suggested event may be identified from among the members of the social network service. An attendee list that includes at least a portion of the attendee members may be generated e.g. there may be hundreds of members that attend an event and only a portion may be included in the attendee list . Various schemes may be employed to determine which attendee members to include in the attendee list. The attendee list may be presented to the user that attended the suggested event after the suggested event has ended. The attendee list may facilitate the user connecting via the social network service with people that attended the suggested event.

As shown in the social networking system is generally based on a three tiered architecture consisting of a front end layer application logic layer and data layer. As is understood by skilled artisans in the relevant computer and Internet related arts each module or engine shown in represents a set of executable software instructions and the corresponding hardware e.g. memory and processor for executing the instructions. To avoid obscuring the inventive subject matter with unnecessary detail various functional modules and engines that are not germane to conveying an understanding of the inventive subject matter have been omitted from . However a skilled artisan will readily recognize that various additional functional modules and engines may be used with a social networking system such as that illustrated in to facilitate additional functionality that is not specifically described herein. Furthermore the various functional modules and engines depicted in may reside on a single server computer or may be distributed across several server computers in various arrangements. Moreover although depicted in as a three tiered architecture the inventive subject matter is by no means limited to such an architecture.

As shown in the front end layer consists of a user interface module s e.g. a web server which receives requests from various client computing devices including one or more client device s and communicates appropriate responses to the requesting device. For example the user interface module s may receive requests in the form of Hypertext Transport Protocol HTTP requests or other web based application programming interface API requests. The client devices may be executing conventional web browser applications also referred to as apps or applications that have been developed for a specific platform to include any of a wide variety of mobile computing devices and mobile specific operating systems. For example client device s may be executing client application s . The client application s may include various components operable to present information to the user and communicate with the network to access the social networking system . Each of the client devices may comprise a computing device that includes at least a display and communication capabilities with the network to access the social networking system . The client devices may comprise but are not limited to remote devices work stations computers general purpose computers Internet appliances hand held devices wireless devices portable devices wearable computers cellular or mobile phones portable digital assistants PDAs smart phones tablets ultrabooks netbooks laptops desktops multi processor systems microprocessor based or programmable consumer electronics game consoles set top boxes network PCs mini computers and the like. One or more users may be a person a machine or other means of interacting with the client device s . The user s may interact with the social networking system via the client device s . The user s may not be part of the networked environment but may be associated with client device s .

As shown in the data layer includes several databases including a database for storing data for various entities of the social graph including member profiles company profiles educational institution profiles as well as information concerning various online or offline groups. Of course with various alternative embodiments any number of other entities might be included in the social graph and as such various other databases may be used to store data corresponding with other entities.

Consistent with some embodiments when a person initially registers to become a member of the social networking service the person will be prompted to provide some personal information such as his or her name age e.g. birth date gender interests contact information home town address the names of the member s spouse and or family members educational background e.g. schools majors etc. current job title job description industry employment history skills professional organizations interests and so on. This information is stored for example as profile data in the database with reference number .

Once registered a member may invite other members or be invited by other members to connect via the social networking service. A connection may specify a bilateral agreement by the members such that both members acknowledge the establishment of the connection. Similarly with some embodiments a member may elect to follow another member. In contrast to establishing a connection the concept of following another member typically is a unilateral operation and at least with some embodiments does not require acknowledgement or approval by the member that is being followed. When one member connects with or follows another member the member who is connected to or following the other member may receive messages or updates e.g. content items in his or her personalized content stream about various activities undertaken by the other member. More specifically the messages or updates presented in the content stream may be authored and or published or shared by the other member or may be automatically generated based on some activity or event involving the other member. In addition to following another member a member may elect to follow a company a topic a conversation a web page or some other entity or object which may or may not be included in the social graph maintained by the social networking system. With some embodiments because the content selection algorithm selects content relating to or associated with the particular entities that a member is connected with or is following as a member connects with and or follows other entities the universe of available content items for presentation to the member in his or her content stream increases.

As members interact with various applications content and user interfaces of the social networking system information relating to the member s activity and behavior may be stored in a database such as the database with reference number .

The social networking system may provide a broad range of other applications and services that allow members the opportunity to share and receive information often customized to the interests of the member. For example with some embodiments the social networking system may include a photo sharing application that allows members to upload and share photos with other members. With some embodiments members of the social networking system may be able to self organize into groups or interest groups organized around a subject matter or topic of interest. With some embodiments members may subscribe to or join groups affiliated with one or more companies. For instance with some embodiments members of the social network service may indicate an affiliation with a company at which they are employed such that news and events pertaining to the company are automatically communicated to the members in their personalized activity or content streams. With some embodiments members may be allowed to subscribe to receive information concerning companies other than the company with which they are employed. Membership in a group a subscription or following relationship with a company or group as well as an employment relationship with a company are all examples of different types of relationships that may exist between different entities as defined by the social graph and modeled with social graph data of the database with reference number .

The application logic layer includes various application server module s which in conjunction with the user interface module s generates various user interfaces with data retrieved from various data sources or data services in the data layer. With some embodiments individual application server modules are used to implement the functionality associated with various applications services and features of the social networking system . For instance a messaging application such as an email application an instant messaging application or some hybrid or variation of the two may be implemented with one or more application server modules . A photo sharing application may be implemented with one or more application server modules . Similarly a search engine enabling users to search for and browse member profiles may be implemented with one or more application server modules . Of course other applications and services may be separately embodied in their own application server modules . As illustrated in social networking system may include an event system which is described in more detail below.

Additionally a third party application s executing on a third party server s is shown as being communicatively coupled to the social networking system and the client device s . The third party server s may support one or more features or functions on a website hosted by the third party.

The location information may include information such as timestamps longitude latitude direction of movement speed of travel and the like.

The event module may provide various event related functionality such as determining the suggested event retrieving information corresponding to the suggested event and so on. For example the event module may determine the suggested event based on the location information of the user. The event module may then retrieve the event information corresponding to the suggested event. Many other event relation functions may be performed by the event module .

The analysis module may perform a variety of analyses to facilitate the functionality described herein. For example the analysis module may identify the contact members of the user using the social graph data from among the members of the social network service. The analysis module may identify many other groups of members based on the social graph data profile data and other data.

The notification module may provide a variety of user notification functionality such as communicating notifications to the user communicating notifications to the contact members of the user causing the presentation of user interfaces to the user and so on. For example the notification module may cause presentation of the event information to the user. The notification module may cause the presentation of various user interfaces by communicating instructions for presenting information to a device operable to present information to the user.

In an example embodiment events that are within a distance of the user may be identified and recommended to the user as further depicted in . In this example embodiment the distance may be a user specified distance. For example the current location of the user may be determined by a GPS component of a device of the user. The events having a location that is within a distance of the current location of the user may be identified and included in the suggested events.

In an alternative example embodiment past locations of the user may be used to identify suggested events. For example the location of the user may be stored over time. Frequently visited locations of the user may be used to determine suggested events.

In further example embodiments the suggested events may be identified based on an analysis of the profile data of the user. The profile data of the user may include information such as skills education interests posts and so on. For instance the user may have indicated a skill in Java programming. The event module may identify events that may be of interest to Java programmers e.g. events that include the keyword Java in the title or description may be identified . Many schemes and techniques may be employed to identify the suggested event based on the profile data of the user.

In still further example embodiments the suggested events may be identified based on user social graph data. The user social graph data may include relationships between members of the social network service such as the contact members of the user. The user social graph data may be used to identify suggested events by for example identifying events that the contact members of the user are attending or have attended in the past. Many schemes and techniques may be employed to identify suggested events based on the user social graph data.

In yet further example embodiments the user may specify event criteria used to identify suggested events. The user specified event criteria may include a wide range of criteria such as event types keywords event times event locations event attendees and so on. In an example embodiment the event module may cause presentation of a user interface configured to receive the user specified event criteria. For example the user may be interested in sporting events and the user may have provided the event module with the types of sporting events of interest. The event module may then identify the suggested events that are of the same or a similar event type to the user specified event type. Many schemes and techniques may be employed to identify suggested events based on the user specified event criteria.

Referring back to at operation the notification module may cause presentation of the event information that corresponds to the suggested event to the user. The event information may include a variety of information such as an event description e.g. event name event location event topic event speakers event activities event duration event price and so forth number of event attendees a list of event attendees an attendee summary the contact members of the user attending the event as further described in other event information event parking public transportation options handicap accessible weather forecast for the event location and time and so on. The event information may be retrieved from a variety of sources such as the third party servers the social networking system and other sources. The user may be notified of the suggested events for example using a push notification that displays a message with at least a portion of the event information corresponding to the suggested event. The user may be notified of the suggested event using other means such as an in app notification email posts to a social network service profile text message and so forth. In various example embodiments the user may access more detailed event information as depicted in .

In some example embodiments the analysis module may generate an attendee summary based on an analysis of the profile data of the attendee members. The event information may include the attendee summary and may be presented to the user. For example a particular event may be popular with certain members of the social network with a particular background. For instance a game developer conference may be popular with Java developers. The analysis module may analyze the profile data of the attendee members and identify that there are many Java developers at the conference. The attendee summary may indicate that there are many Java developers at the game developer conference. This information may be useful to the user in deciding whether to attend the suggested event. Many schemes and techniques may be employed to generate the attendee summary that may include a wide variety of information.

In further example embodiments the event module may facilitate admittance to the suggested event for the user. For example if the suggested event requires a ticket the event module may provide a means for acquiring the ticket e.g. a link to a webpage where the ticket may be purchased . The event module may also provide parking information optimal travel routes public transportation options and so on to facilitate the user attending the suggested event.

At operation in the event module may receive the user attendance indication from the user. The user attendance indication also referred to as check in may indicate that the user is attending the suggested event. The event module may store the user attendance indication and attendance indications from other members of the social network service for use in the future. The attendance indications may be stored for example in the database . In various example embodiments the user may provide attendance indications for other members of the social network service such as the contact members of the user e.g. the user may be attending the suggested event with a group of contact members and may provide a check in for the entire group . In some example embodiments the user attendance indication may be received via user input. For instance the notification module may query whether the user is attending the suggested event by causing presentation of a user interface configured to receive the user attendance indication as depicted in .

In alternative embodiments the user attendance indication may be received in response to the attendance trigger. In some instances the attendance trigger may automatically provide the user attendance indication to the event module and in other instances the attendance trigger may query the user as to whether the user is attending the suggested event as depicting in . Many different types of triggers may be employed. For example the user may trigger communication of the user attendance indication by moving within a trigger distance of the suggested event e.g. the user goes to the suggested event and the current location of the user as determined by a GPS component of a mobile device of the user indicates that the user is near the event or inside the building hosting the suggested event . The trigger distance may be a predetermined distance that is sufficient to indicate that the user is attending the event e.g. a distance smaller than the size of the event building . In another example embodiment the user may trigger the communication of the user attendance indication by moving within a trigger boundary surrounding the suggested event e.g. the boundary may correspond to the boundary of the building or other location of the suggested event . In other example embodiments communication of the user attendance indication may be triggered by a NFC component of the client device of the user communicating with an iBeacon located at the suggested event. In a furthe example embodiment communication of the user attendance indication may be triggered by the NFC component of the client device of the user communicating with another device of a member of the social network service that is attending the suggested event. In still further example embodiments communication of the user attendance indication may be triggered by the user scanning a quick response QR code located at the suggested event. Many varieties of triggering mechanisms may be employed to trigger communication of the user attendance indication.

In further example embodiments the user may provide a departure indication received at the event module that indicates the user has left the suggested event. The departure indication may be stored for example in database . The departure indication may help provide accurate information about the number of attendees currently at the suggested event this information may be useful to other users in deciding whether to attend the suggested event . Member departure indications similar to the departure indication may be received from members of the social network service and stored in database for example. In some example embodiments the departure indication may be received in response to a departure trigger. In some instances the departure trigger may automatically provide the user departure indication to the event module and in other instances the departure trigger may query the user as to whether the user is departing the suggested event.

The term machine readable medium shall accordingly be taken to include but not be limited to one or more data repositories in the form of a solid state memory an optical medium a magnetic medium or any suitable combination thereof.

Furthermore the machine readable medium is non transitory in that it does not embody a propagating signal. However labeling the machine readable medium as non transitory should not be construed to mean that the medium is incapable of movement the medium should be considered as being transportable from one physical location to another. Additionally since the machine readable medium is tangible the medium may be considered to be a machine readable device.

The instructions may further be transmitted or received over a communications network using a transmission medium via the network interface device and utilizing any one of a number of well known transfer protocols e.g. hypertext transfer protocol HTTP . Examples of communication networks include a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN the Internet mobile telephone networks plain old telephone service POTS networks and wireless data networks e.g. WiFi LTE and WiMAX networks . The term transmission medium shall be taken to include any intangible medium that is capable of storing encoding or carrying instructions for execution by the machine and includes digital or analog communications signals or other intangible medium to facilitate communication of such software.

Throughout this specification plural instances may implement components operations or structures described as a single instance. Although individual operations of one or more methods are illustrated and described as separate operations one or more of the individual operations may be performed concurrently and nothing requires that the operations be performed in the order illustrated. Structures and functionality presented as separate components in example configurations may be implemented as a combined structure or component. Similarly structures and functionality presented as a single component may be implemented as separate components. These and other variations modifications additions and improvements fall within the scope of the subject matter herein.

Certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of components modules or mechanisms. Modules may constitute either software modules e.g. code embodied on a machine readable medium or in a transmission signal or hardware modules. A hardware module is a tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain physical manner. In various example embodiments one or more computer systems e.g. a standalone computer system a client computer system or a server computer system or one or more hardware modules of a computer system e.g. a processor or a group of processors may be configured by software e.g. an application or application portion as a hardware module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.

In some embodiments a hardware module may be implemented mechanically electronically or any suitable combination thereof. For example a hardware module may include dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured to perform certain operations. For example a hardware module may be a special purpose processor such as a field programmable gate array FPGA or an ASIC. A hardware module may also include programmable logic or circuitry that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. For example a hardware module may include software encompassed within a general purpose processor or other programmable processor. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry or in temporarily configured circuitry e.g. configured by software may be driven by cost and time considerations.

Accordingly the phrase hardware module should be understood to encompass a tangible entity be that an entity that is physically constructed permanently configured e.g. hardwired or temporarily configured e.g. programmed to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein. As used herein hardware implemented module refers to a hardware module. Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured e.g. programmed each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example where a hardware module comprises a general purpose processor configured by software to become a special purpose processor the general purpose processor may be configured as respectively different special purpose processors e.g. comprising different hardware modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure the processor for example to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.

Hardware modules can provide information to and receive information from other hardware modules. Accordingly the described hardware modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple hardware modules exist contemporaneously communications may be achieved through signal transmission e.g. over appropriate circuits and buses between or among two or more of the hardware modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times communications between such hardware modules may be achieved for example through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example one hardware module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then at a later time access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices and can operate on a resource e.g. a collection of information .

The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed at least partially by one or more processors that are temporarily configured e.g. by software or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured such processors may constitute processor implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions described herein. As used herein processor implemented module refers to a hardware module implemented using one or more processors .

Similarly the methods described herein may be at least partially processor implemented with a processor being an example of hardware. For example at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or more processors or processor implemented modules. Moreover the one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a cloud computing environment or as a software as a service SaaS . For example at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers as examples of machines including processors with these operations being accessible via the network e.g. the Internet and via one or more appropriate interfaces e.g. an application program interface API .

The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors not only residing within a single machine but deployed across a number of machines . In some example embodiments the one or more processors or processor implemented modules may be located in a single geographic location e.g. within a home environment an office environment or a server farm . In other example embodiments the one or more processors or processor implemented modules may be distributed across a number of geographic locations.
