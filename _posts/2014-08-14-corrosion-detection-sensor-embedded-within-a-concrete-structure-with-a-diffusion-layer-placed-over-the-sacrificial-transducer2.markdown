abstract: A corrosion detection sensor embedded within a concrete structure. The sensor includes a hermetically sealed resonant circuit that is a resistor-inductor-capacitor (RLC) circuit. The sensor further includes a sacrificial transducer that is inductively or capacitively coupled to the resonant circuit, where the sacrificial transducer is exposed to an environment outside the sensor to monitor corrosion of steel reinforcement in the concrete structure. Additionally, the sensor includes a protective cementitious housing surrounding the resonant circuit and the sacrificial transducer. The sensor further includes a diffusion layer placed over the sacrificial transducer, where the diffusion layer enables a dispersion of a chemical species over the sacrificial transducer.

The present invention relates generally to monitoring corrosion in steel reinforcement in concrete structures and more particularly to a corrosion detection sensor embedded within a concrete structure with a diffusion layer placed over the sacrificial transducer.

Structural degradation of concrete structures due to corrosion of the reinforcing steel is one of the most extensive durability problems facing concrete structures. This gives rise to concerns about structural safety integrity and serviceability. As a result monitoring the corrosion of the steel reinforcement in the concrete structures is greatly desired so as to detect the state of corrosion of the reinforcing steel in these concrete structures thereby being able to address the corrosion through preventive remedial measures and economic repairs before it leads to severe structural damage or failure. By being able to implement preventive remedial measures prior to severe structural damage or failure the overall life cycle costs in maintaining and repairing the concrete structures will be lower than the cost of rehabilitating such structures after the point of severe structural damage or failure.

Monitoring this corrosion is difficult though since the embedded steel is not visible to the naked eye. Furthermore detection techniques are needed to indicate initiation of corrosion so that remedial action can be taken before the damage is irreversible. Detection techniques such as acoustic ultrasonic and radar have proved to be limited in this capacity.

Conventional corrosion monitoring techniques such as half cell potential and linear polarization provide instantaneous measurements which are highly subject to the conditions e.g. moisture temperature during measurement. Alternatively sensors that are placed within the concrete structures using a sacrificial corroding element provide the most direct measurement of corrosion. However obtaining this data requires electrical access such as by wire to the sensor. Any methods that require running wires breach the concrete and provide an ingress point for corrosive agents.

As a result monitoring the corrosion of the steel reinforcement in concrete structures without breaching the concrete such as by running wires would greatly advance the ease and accuracy in measuring the corrosion. Furthermore given the need for long term monitoring of these concrete structures such monitoring devices should be battery free cost effective durable and reliable.

In one embodiment of the present invention a corrosion detection sensor embedded within a concrete structure comprises a hermetically sealed resonant circuit comprising an inductor a resistor and a capacitor. The corrosion detection sensor further comprises a sacrificial transducer that is inductively or capacitively coupled to the resonant circuit where the sacrificial transducer is exposed to an environment outside the sensor to monitor corrosion of steel reinforcement in the concrete structure. The corrosion detection sensor additionally comprises a protective cementitious housing surrounding the resonant circuit and the sacrificial transducer. Furthermore the corrosion detection sensor comprises a diffusion layer placed over the sacrificial transducer where the diffusion layer enables a dispersion of a chemical species over the sacrificial transducer.

The sensor comprises a hermetically sealed resonant circuit comprising an inductor a resistor and a capacitor. The sensor further comprises a sacrificial transducer that is inductively or capacitively coupled to the resonant circuit where the sacrificial transducer is exposed to an environment outside the sensor to monitor corrosion of steel reinforcement in the concrete structure.

Furthermore the sensor comprises a diffusion layer placed over the sacrificial transducer where the diffusion layer enables a dispersion of a chemical species over the sacrificial transducer. The surveillance system additionally comprises an external reader configured to interrogate the sensor by using magnetic coupling between a coil of the reader and the resonant circuit.

The foregoing has outlined rather generally the features and technical advantages of one or more embodiments of the present invention in order that the detailed description of the present invention that follows may be better understood. Additional features and advantages of the present invention will be described hereinafter which may form the subject of the claims of the present invention.

While the following discusses the present invention in connection with measuring the corrosion of steel reinforcement in concrete structures the principles of the present invention may be applied to other environments such as chemical and biomedical where the concept of using a diffusion membrane to ensure the uniform dispersion of a chemical species of interest is desired. A person of ordinary skill in the art would be capable of applying the principles of the present invention to such implementations. Further embodiments applying the principles of the present invention to such implementations would fall within the scope of the present invention.

Furthermore while the following discusses the present invention in connection with using passive circuitry the present invention may also utilize active circuitry. A person of ordinary skill in the art would be capable of applying the principles of the present invention to such implementations. Further embodiments applying the principles of the present invention to such implementations would fall within the scope of the present invention.

The present invention presents a new class of passive wireless corrosion sensors. The noncontact NC sensor platform provides an economical and nondestructive means for detecting corrosion initiation within concrete. The sensor is powered through the inductive coupling to an external mobile reader that can be handheld or mounted on a vehicle. It is envisioned that the sensor will be embedded in concrete during construction and interrogated sporadically over the service life of the structure. The sensor output can be used to detect corrosion initiation within concrete and is expected to enhance the quality information collected during qualitative routine bridge inspections.

In one embodiment the NC sensor prototype consists of a resonant circuit that is inductively coupled to a sacrificial transducer. Corrosion of the sacrificial element alters the measured sensor response and is used to detect corrosion within concrete. Unlike the traditional corrosion evaluation methods such as half cell potentials the output of the sensors of the present invention is insensitive to environmental variations.

Referring now to the Figures illustrates a configuration of an electronic structural surveillance ES S system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in ESS system includes a passive battery less wireless sensor embedded within a concrete structure . In one embodiment sensor is hermetically sealed. In one embodiment sensor operates using magnetic coupling between an external reader coil and sensor resonant circuit of sensor enabling non destructive long term monitoring of civil infrastructure. Specifically as discussed further herein passive sensor includes a transduction layer that supports non contact interaction with the resonant sensor s circuitry. One application of ESS system is in the detection of corrosion of embedded steel reinforcement in concrete structures . As discussed further herein sensor includes a sacrificial corroding transducer element to monitor the corrosion. By allowing wire free interaction between the exposed transducer and the hermetically sealed sensor circuitry the transducer remains fully exposed to the environment that it is monitoring yet does not compromise the sensor electronics by breaching the hermetic seal. A more detail description of the design of the embedded passive wireless sensor is provided below in connection with .

Sensor further includes a hermetically sealed resonant circuit that is inductively coupled to sacrificial transducer . Alternatively transducer may be capacitively coupled to resonant circuit . In one embodiment resonant circuit is a resistor inductor capacitor RLC circuit. While illustrates sensor including a resonant circuit the principles of the present invention may include the use of RFID tags RFID chip plus a resonant circuit to replace resonant circuit . The placement of sacrificial transducer in the vicinity of an RFID tag should induce similar inductive effects as with resonant circuit . The principles of the present invention are not to be limited in scope to the discussed technologies and may include other technologies with the ability to monitor corrosion.

Furthermore as illustrated in sensor is housed in a protective cementitious housing protecting sensor from its outside elements where cementitious housing has properties that match or are similar to that of its environment. In one embodiment housing is a fiber reinforced cementitious paste housing. Cementitious housing provides physical protection to sensor during construction and provides a convenient base to affix sacrificial transducer e.g. sacrificial steel washer . Polypropylene fibers may be used to reinforce the paste and control shrinkage cracking In one embodiment the outer diameter of protective housing is set at approximately 4 inches to prevent cracking during curing. In one embodiment housing has a convex shape so as to prevent trapping air below sensor during the placement of concrete.

In one embodiment diffusion layer is made of material hygroscopic which provides a water absorbing medium. This enables the dispersion of chloride ions from deicing salts or salt water in the regions of high concentrations e.g. near cracks localized to the rest of the sacrificial transducer e.g. anode of the transducer . Additionally diffusion layer ensures a more uniform distribution of corrosive salts over the entire surface of sacrificial transducer . This provides a uniform corrosion response mitigating the effects of localized corrosion. Diffusion layer can also be used to smooth out each stage in a multi threshold sensor improving its dynamic range and making concurrent multi threshold detection feasible. In addition diffusion layer does not affect sensor s cementitious packaging matched with the environment . Thus the linearity robustness and reliability of the embedded corrosion sensor is substantially improved.

The innovative design of sensor enables the utilization of corrosion transducers fabricated from a variety of materials and morphologies. However the selection of a suitable sacrificial corroding element is critical to the successful development of an embeddable corrosion sensor . To this end sacrificial element should possess the following three attributes 

1. Sacrificial element should exhibit electrochemical properties that are similar to the low carbon steels used for the manufacturing of deformed reinforcement. As a result shifts in the response of the NC sensors embedded in concrete will be indicative of real active corrosion in the adjacent steel.

2. Sacrificial element should be able to electromagnetically inductive capacitive interact with resonator e.g. a capacitive transducer may not shield fields between reader and the sensor coils but changes the resonator s capacitance .

3. Sacrificial element should be inexpensive commercially available and mass produced. This will minimize the final cost of NC sensor and allow for the deployment of corrosion sensor in typical concrete bridges.

Examples of sacrificial transducers that meet these attributes include steel washers and closed wire spirals. In one embodiment the shape of sacrificial transducers corresponds to a circular elliptical or polygon shape.

Currently designed corrosion monitored sensors that are embedded in concrete structures to monitor the corrosion of steel reinforcement can be affected by localized corrosion. The transition from uncorroded to corroded states can be halted temporarily before reaching the fully corroded state. This behavior can be the result of the formation of a dense layer of corrosion products in the crack region that subsequently block the supply of chloride ions to the active anode of the transducer and halt the corrosion process. The slower corrosion rate can also be the result of a local and unique electrochemical condition that led to the repassivation of the steel near the cracked region. As a result of adding diffusion layer that is placed over transducer a more uniform distribution of chloride ions over the surface of sacrificial transducer mitigating the localized corrosion is ensured. Furthermore such a design is less susceptible to false positives.

In summary sensor mitigates the undesirable effects of localized corrosion which makes the sensor response unpredictable. It is insensitive to localized corrosion effects due to the random location and size of cracks. Furthermore the accuracy and reliability in indicating a corroded state is improved. In addition the uniform corrosion leads to a more analog response between the sensor states. This can be particularly useful for multi threshold detection. It benefits from all the advantages of wire free transducer interaction which protects sensor circuitry by maintaining hermeticity. Overall sensor has improved linearity robustness reliability and can reduce incidence of false negative detection events.
