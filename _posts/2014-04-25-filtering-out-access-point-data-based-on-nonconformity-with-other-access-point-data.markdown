The present disclosure relates to filtering out signal strength data associated with a network device and a client device when the signal strength data fails to correlate with other pieces of signal strength data associated with the client device. This filtered data may be used to produce more accurate client device location estimates by intelligently examining detected signal strength values.

Over the last decade there has been a substantial increase in the use and deployment of network devices. For example smartphones laptop computers desktop computers tablet computers and smart appliances may each communicate over wireless switching networks. Commonly the location of these devices may be determined using a variety of techniques.

For example strength characteristics of signals transmitted by a wireless device and received by a set of access points may be examined to triangulate the position of the wireless device. However the strength characteristics for one or more of these wireless signals may be inaccurate or skewed based on anomalies in the transmission environment. As a result the estimated location of the wireless device which may be calculated partially based on these inaccurate strength characteristics may also be inaccurate.

The access points may be any device that can associate with the client device to transmit and receive data over wireless channels and or detect wireless signals transmitted by the client device . In one embodiment the access points may correspond to a network device such as a wireless access point a switch a router or any combination thereof. shows a component diagram of the access point according to one embodiment. In other embodiments the access points may include similar or identical components to those shown and described in relation to the access point .

As shown in the access point may comprise one or more of a hardware processor data storage an input output I O interface and device configuration logic . Each of these components of the access point will be described in further detail below.

The data storage of the access point may include a fast read write memory for storing programs and data during operations and a hierarchy of persistent memory such as Read Only Memory ROM Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory EPROM and or Flash memory for example for storing instructions and data needed for the startup and or operation of the access point . In one embodiment the data storage is a distributed set of data storage components. The data storage may store data that is to be transmitted from the access point or data that is received by the access point . For example the access point may store data to be forwarded to the client device or to one or more of the access points . In another embodiment the data storage may store signal strength values for one or more wireless signals received from the client device . These strength values may be used for estimating the location of the client device as will be described in greater detail below.

In one embodiment the I O interface corresponds to one or more components used for communicating with other devices e.g. the client device the controller the ALE and or other access points within the system via wired or wireless signals. The I O interface may include a wired network interface such as an IEEE 802.3 Ethernet interface and or a wireless interface such as an IEEE 802.11 WiFi interface. The I O interface may communicate with the client device the controller the ALE and or the access points over corresponding wireless channels in the system .

In some embodiments the I O interface may include one or more antennas for communicating with the client device the controller the ALE the access points other wireless devices in the network system and or other devices over the external network . For example multiple antennas may be used for forming transmission beams to one or more of the client device and or the access points through adjustment of gain and phase values for corresponding antenna transmissions. The generated beams may avoid objects and create an unobstructed path to the client device and or the access .

In one embodiment the I O interface in conjunction with the antennas may detect wireless signals emitted by the client device . In this embodiment the client device may not be directly associated with the access point such that the client device and the access point maintain a data connection but the access point is still able to detect the presence of the proximate neighboring client device including signal strength characteristics for corresponding wireless signals. For example in the dashed lines indicates that the client device is visible to and or in range of the access points and although the access points and and the client device may not share a data connection. Instead the client device is only associated and maintains a data connection with the access point e.g. a data connection using one or more network protocols as signified by the solid line. Accordingly each of the access points and may detect nearby signals of the client device even without an established data connection. Detection of these signals by the access points may be used by to determine an estimated current location of the client device as will be described in greater detail below.

In one embodiment the hardware processor is coupled to the data storage and the I O interface .

As described above the other access points may be similarly configured as described above in relation to the access point . For example access points may comprise hardware processor data storage input output I O interface and device configuration logic in a similar fashion as described above in relation to the access point .

In one embodiment the controller and or the ALE may be similarly configured as described above in relation to the access point . For example the controller and or the ALE may comprise hardware processor data storage input output I O interface and device configuration logic in a similar fashion as described above in relation to the access point .

In one embodiment the client device is a digital device that includes a hardware processor memory hierarchy and input output I O interfaces including a wired and or wireless interface such as an IEEE 802.11 interface. In one embodiment the configuration of the components within the client device may be similar to those discussed above in relation to the access point .

Calculating the Location of the Client Device Based on Signal Strength Differences and or Rate of Change Data

Turning now to a method for calculating the estimated current location of the client device according to one embodiment will be described. In one embodiment each operation of the method may be performed by one or more components of the access points the client device the controller and or the ALE . Although the operations of the method are shown and described in a particular order in other embodiments the operations may be performed in a different order. For example in some embodiments the operations of the method may be performed concurrently or during overlapping time periods.

In one embodiment the method begins at operation with the retrieval of one or more pieces of information that describe wireless signals emitted by the client device and received by one or more of the access points . In one embodiment the information may include signal strength values corresponding to the wireless signals received by the access points . For example as shown in the client device may transmit wireless signals A D to the access points . The wireless signals A D may be transmitted by the client device at a predefined power level which is shared with the access points . For instance the wireless signals A D may be transmitted to the access points at 20 dB.

In one embodiment the received signals A D may be transmitted as part of a data transfer or a communication involving control signals with one or more of the access points . For example the signals A D may be part of a wireless data transfer or a communication of control signals using an established data connection between the client device and the access point e.g. a data connection using one or more network protocols . These wireless signals A D may be detected by the access points even though the access points and and the client device have not established a data connection. Although described as being related to a data transfer in other embodiments the wireless signals A D may be a beacon transmitted by the client device with the intended purpose of determining the current location of the client device . Again these wireless signals A D may be detected by the access points even though the access points and and the client device may not have established a data connection.

As noted above the information received at operation includes signal strength data. For example in one embodiment the data received at operation may include received signal strength indicators RSSIs associated with the wireless signals A D. The RSSI values describe the strength of the wireless signals A D upon receipt by corresponding access points . Since these signals A D have traversed some distance between the client device and each respective access point the signals may attenuate and decrease in power. For instance although the signals A D may have originally been transmitted at 20 dB the power of the wireless signal A received by the access point may be 18 dB the power of the wireless signal B received by the access point may be 15 dB the power of the wireless signal C received by the access point may be 16 dB and the power of the wireless signal D received by the access point may be 19 dB.

As noted above the access points may be aware of the power with which the signals A D were originally transmitted by the client device e.g. 20 dB . This transmitting power may be shared prior to transmitting the signals A D or the signals A D may themselves include this power information encoded therein.

Although described above in relation to a single signal strength value for each access point the information received at operation may include multiple signal strength values for each of the access points . These multiple values correspond to multiple sets of wireless signals A D received by each associated access point over time. For example Table 1 below shows an example set of signal strength values e.g. RSSIs that may be retrieved obtained at operation .

The signal strength values listed in Table 1 correspond to separate points in time. Accordingly the first signal strength value listed for each access point corresponds to time T the second signal strength value listed for each access point corresponds to time T the third signal strength value listed for each access point corresponds to time T and the fourth signal strength value listed for each access point corresponds to time T. In one embodiment each of the signal strength values shown in Table 1 is transmitted by each corresponding access point to the ALE over time. Accordingly the ALE may collect and store signal strength values for computing the location of the client device .

Following operation operation may determine a correlation between the one or more signal strength values received at operation . For example operation may determine 1 a difference value between a set of signal strength values for each individual access point and or 2 a rate of change between the signal strength values for each individual access point . These computed values may be used for determining defining the correlation between signal strength values for each access point .

For example in one embodiment operation may compute the difference between the two most recent signal strength values for the access points e.g. the two rightmost signal strength values in Table 1 associated with each of the access points . Using the example dataset in Table 1 the difference between the two most recent signal strength values for the access point would be 1 dB i.e. 18 dB 17 dB the difference between two most recent signal strength values for the access point would be 8 dB i.e. 22 dB 14 dB the difference between the two most recent signal strength values for the access point would be 2 dB i.e. 15 dB 17 dB and the difference between the two most recent signal strength values for the access point would be 1 dB i.e. 19 dB 18 dB .

In one embodiment the computed differences between signal strength values for each access point may be compared against a predefined difference threshold to determine whether the signal strength values for a particular access point are correlated. For example the predefined difference threshold may be 2 dB. In one embodiment an absolute value of the difference values may be used for comparison such that a general variance can be observed. Since the absolute value of the differences 1 dB 2 dB and 1 dB corresponding to the access points and respectively are equal or below the difference threshold value of 2 dB operation may determine that the two most recent signal strength values for the access points and are highly correlated. In contrast since the difference of 8 dB for the access point is above the difference threshold value operation may determine that the two most recent signal strength values for the access point have a low correlation and or are not correlated.

As noted above instead of determining a strict difference between the two most recent signal strength values for each access point operation may determine a rate of change for the signal strength values in relation to each access point . This rate of change may thereafter be used to determine correlation. In one embodiment the last two signal strength values for each of the access points and associated times for each of the signal strength values may be used to compute a rate of change for each of the access points . For the example dataset provided above in Table 1 the two most recent signal strength values for the access points may represent detected values at 3 01 PM and 3 02 PM respectively. Accordingly the rate of change of the signal strength values for the access point may be computed as 

Similarly the rate of changes for the access points may be 8 dB minute 2 dB minute and 1 dB minute respectively. The computed rates of change may be compared against a predefined rate of change threshold to determine whether the signal strength values for each of the access points are correlated. In one embodiment an absolute value of the rates of change may be used for comparison such that a general variance can be observed. For example the predefined rate of change threshold may be 2 dB minute. Since the absolute value of the rates of change of 1 dB minute 2 dB minute and 1 dB minute corresponding to the access points and respectively are equal or below this rate of change threshold value operation may determine that the most recent signal strength values for the access points and are highly correlated. In contrast the rate of change of signal strength values for the access point may be 8 dB minute. In this case since the rate of change for the signal strength values of the access point is above the rate of change threshold value operation may determine that the most recent signal strength values for the access point have a low correlation and or are not correlated.

Although described above in relation to a pair of signal strength values for each of the access points in other embodiments three or more signal strength values for each of the access points may be used to determine differences rates of change and corresponding correlations between these datasets.

As described above although operation may utilize difference or rate of change information to determine signal strength correlation the method will be further explained below in relation to only difference information. However it is understood that rate of change information or any other data used to describe correlation may be similarly used in place of these difference values.

On the basis of the correlation data computed at operation and or the original signal strength values obtained at operation operation may determine if the client device has moved between readings of signal strength values. A move of the client device may be exemplified by significant changes in signal strength values for a majority of the access points that result in the signal strength values having low or no correlation. For example operation may examine the correlation data computed at operation for each access point to determine if there is a low correlation between the most recent signal strength values for a majority of the access points . For example based on Table 1 above the signal strength values for the access points and may show a high correlation as described above. Based on this high correlation between signal strength values recorded for each these access points and operation may conclude that the client device is not moving during a time period between the last two signal strength values. In particular since the signal strength values for the access points and do not indicate a large difference or rate of change the client device is likely stable between successive signal strength value readings. In the example dataset presented in Table 1 the signal strength values for the access point indicate a low correlation as described above in relation to operation . Although there is a low correlation for signal strength readings for this access point which under some circumstances would indicate movement of the client device one or more of the signal strength values for this access point may be considered an outlier or an anomaly in the face of the high correlation determined for the access points and . In particular since more of the access points have a high correlation for respective signal strength values taken at designated times the client device may be determined to be stable or not moving despite the low correlation for the signal strength values associated with the access point .

It should be noted that although the client device is determined not to be moving during successive signal strength readings the slight movement in these values may be the result of jitter or other minor variances. Accordingly by comparing these differences or rates of changes against a threshold the method may avoid a determination that the client device has moved when in fact the changes were the result of system irregularities.

Based on the dataset shown in Table 2 the access points have differences between the two most recent signal strength values of 13 dB 12 dB 27 dB and 13 dB respectively. On the basis of these differences operation may determine that the access points have low correlations between the two most recent signal strength values for each of the access points . On the basis of these low correlations operation may determine that the client device has moved between the period of time the last two signal strength values were detected for each access point .

Based on the dataset shown in Table 3 the access points have differences between the two most recent signal strength values of 13 dB 12 dB 2 dB and 13 dB respectively. On the basis of this dataset operation may determine that the access points and have low correlations between the two most recent signal strength values. In contrast the access points may have a difference between the two most recent signal strength values of 2 dB. On the basis of this relatively small difference operation may have determined a high correlation between signal strength values for this access point . Even though the access point exhibited a high correlation between signal strength values operation may still determine that the client device has moved between the period of time the two most recent signal strength values were detected based on the low correlation of signal strength values for a majority of the access points e.g. the access points and .

Upon determining that the client device has moved at operation the method may move to operation . At operation a set of access points and corresponding signal strength values are selected to determine the location of the client device . In one embodiment the selection of access points may be based on the magnitude amount of movement of the client device suggested by each set of signal strength values for each access point . In particular a similar difference or rate of change between signal strength values may be used to select a set of access points and corresponding signal strength values.

For example in the dataset shown in Table 2 the signal strength values for each of the access points indicate that the client device has moved between the period of time the last two signal strength values for each access point were detected. Although the signal strength values for each of the access points lead to the same general conclusion i.e. movement of the client device the amount of movement for the client device suggested by the access points and e.g. 13 dB 12 dB and 13 dB are closer in magnitude than the amount of movement for the client device suggested by the access point e.g. 27 dB . In terms of distance of movement the access points and may suggest that the client device has moved 5 meters while the access point may suggest that the client device has moved 10 meters.

Since the signal strength values for the access point suggest a magnitude of movement far greater than the signal strength values for the access points and operation may discard the values for access point in favor of the signal strength values for the access points and . Since signal strength values are only needed from three access points to accurately triangulate the position of the client device discarding the signal strength values of the access point should not negatively affect location estimation of the client device .

In one embodiment where each of the access points return similarly lowly correlated values and or indicate movement of the client device with similar magnitudes operation may select access points with the highest signal strength values. Generally the stronger the signal strength values the more accurate the reading. This increased accuracy is based on the close positioning of the client device to the corresponding access point which yield this stronger greater signal strength value. In particular the transmitted signal has less distance to attenuate and be generally altered.

Returning again to operation upon determining that the client device has not moved the method may move to operation . At operation the method may discard individual signal strength values that have resulted in a low correlation between signal strength values of a corresponding access point . For example in the dataset shown in Table 1 above the two most recent signal strength values for the access point generate a difference of 8 dB. As noted above this difference value may indicate a low correlation i.e. a difference greater than the difference threshold and corresponding movement of the client device . Since the signal strength values for the other access points and have indicated that the client device is likely not moving the method may conclude that one or more signal strength values associated with the access point are inaccurate. At operation the inaccurate signal strength values may be discarded.

In one embodiment operation may discard the last detected signal strength value and replace this discarded value with the previous signal strength value. For example in the dataset shown in Table 1 the signal strength values corresponding to the access point may be replaced with the signal strength values . Since only the last known signal strength value is determined to be inaccurate and the client device has been determined to not have moved since the previous detected signal strength value replacing the last detected signal strength value with the previous signal strength value should produce an accurate estimation of the location of the client device .

Although described as discarding and replacing particular signal strength values in some embodiments operation may select particular access points with corresponding sets of signal strength values in a similar fashion as described above in relation to operation . In one embodiment the selection of access points and corresponding sets of signal strength values may be based on correlation data computed at operation . For example in the dataset shown in Table 1 the differences between signal strength values for the access points are 1 dB 8 dB 2 dB and 1 dB respectively. Accordingly the differences for the access points and are between 1 dB 2 dB. In contrast the difference for the access point is 8 dB. Accordingly the difference value for the access point is on the order of 2 4 times that of the difference values for the access points and . Based on this level of dissimilarity operation may select the access points and and corresponding sets of signal strength values and discard the signal strength values associated with the access point .

In one embodiment where each of the access points return similarly highly correlated values operation may select access points with the highest signal strength values. As noted above the stronger the signal strength values the more accurate the reading. This increased accuracy is based on the close positioning of the client device to the corresponding access point which yield this stronger greater signal strength value. In particular the transmitted signal has less distance to attenuate and be generally altered.

Although described as simultaneously analyzing a set of signal strength values corresponding to four separate access points in some embodiments the method may first analyze a set of signal strength values corresponding to three separate access points . Upon determining that one of the access points is returning inaccurate signal strength values signal strength values for a fourth access point may be retrieved and analyzed.

Following selection of three access points with corresponding sets of signal strength values at either operation or operation operation may estimate the location of the client device based on the selected signal strength values. Based on the determined power of the wireless signals at receipt and knowledge of the power of the signals at transmission each of the selected access points may determine a distance or range separating the client device and each respective access point . As shown in the access points may be selected for location estimation of the client device at operations or . The estimated distance between each of the access points and the client device may be represented by the circles A C where the radius of the circles A C indicate the estimated distance between the client device and each respective access point . These distance estimates may be determined based on 1 estimated transfer function s describing signal propagation degradation between the client device and the access points and or 2 a table mapping signal attenuation to distance estimates. Although described as a single distance estimate between the client device and the access points in some embodiments a distance range may be provided.

As shown in the estimated current location of the client device may be the location X which falls in the intersection between the circles A C. In one embodiment the estimated current location of the client device may be relative to one or more of the access points . In another embodiment based on knowledge of the location of one or more of the access points the detected current location may be relative to another object e.g. a landmark an area e.g. a room in which the client device and or the access points are located a campus or the entire earth i.e. GPS coordinates .

As described above the estimated location of the client device is computed based on filtered signal strength values for corresponding access points . By filtering signal strength values through a heuristic and intra access point analysis the method eliminates inaccurate or anomalistic values which may negatively alter the estimated location of the client device . Accordingly the method may produce more accurate client device location estimates by intelligently examining detected values.

Turning now to a method for calculating the estimated current location of the client device according to one embodiment will be described. In one embodiment each operation of the method may be performed by one or more components of the access points the client device the controller and or the ALE . Although the operations of the method are shown and described in a particular order in other embodiments the operations may be performed in a different order. For example in some embodiments the operations of the method may be performed concurrently or during overlapping time periods.

The method may commence at operation with retrieval of one or more pieces of information that describe wireless signals emitted by the client device and received by one or more of the access points . Operation may be performed in a similar fashion as operation described above. In one embodiment the information retrieved at operation may include signal strength values corresponding to the wireless signals received by the access points . For example Table 4 shows a set of signal strength values that may be retrieved at operation .

Each of the signal strength values correspond to a single shared time. Accordingly the signal strength values may be used to estimate the location of the client device at this shared time.

Following operation operation may divide the area location in which the access points are located into a set of equally sized cells. In this embodiment the location of each of the access points is known. shows an example of an area in which the access points are located. The area may be an office a floor of a building a campus or any other environment in which the access points are installed. As shown in the area may be divided into twenty five cells A Y.

At operation expected signal strength values may be computed for each of the cells . The expected signal strength values represent the signal strength of wireless signals transmitted by each of the access points after the signals have propagated through the area to each corresponding cell A Y. In one embodiment the expected signal strength value for a cell A Y located a distance d from a corresponding access point may be calculated based on the path loss equation below Expected Path Loss 10log 

In the above equation d may be the distance a wireless signal travels and the values k and n may be estimated for the environment in which the access points are located. For example in indoor environments k may be 40 and n may be 4. Based on the expected path loss the expected signal strength values for each of the cells A Y may be calculated and associated with each cell A Y as shown in .

Following calculation of expected signal strength values at operation operation may determine an error vector for each cell A Y in the area as shown in . In one embodiment the error vector may be calculated based on the expected signal strength values calculated at operation and the actual signal strength values retrieved at operation . In particular the error vector may be calculated as the difference between the expected signal strength values for each access point and the actual signal strength values. The error vector represents the likelihood the client device is in each cell A Y based on the actual signal strength values. Accordingly low error vector values may indicate a strong likelihood that the client device is located in a particular cell .

At operation a cell may be selected as the estimated location of the client device . In one embodiment the selection at operation may be performed to minimize error vector values or minimize the absolute value of the error vector values while maximizing the actual signal strength values received for a particular cell A Y. Generally the stronger the signal strength values the more accurate the reading. This increased accuracy is based on the close positioning of the client device to the corresponding access point which yield this stronger greater signal strength value. In particular the transmitted signal has less distance to attenuate and be generally altered by the characteristics of the area .

As described above the estimated location of the client device is computed based on determining error vectors and selecting the cell within the area with the lowest error vector values. By filtering selecting a cell in this fashion the method eliminates signal strength values that are likely inaccurate. Accordingly the method may produce more accurate client device location estimates by intelligently examining detected values.
