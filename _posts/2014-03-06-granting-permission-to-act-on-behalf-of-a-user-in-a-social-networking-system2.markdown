title: Granting permission to act on behalf of a user in a social networking system
abstract: A social networking system allows entities to delegate actions performed on behalf of the entity to social networking system users by assigning one or more roles to social networking system users. Roles may be assigned based on information associated with the entity by the social networking system. Different roles are associated with sets of permissions specifying actions a user associated with a role is authorized to perform on behalf of the entity via the social networking system. Certain permissions of a role associated with the user may be associated with additional users by the user. A persona including a subset of information associated with a user by the social networking system may be created for a user assigned a role, allowing the user to limit information accessible to additional users connected to the persona.

This disclosure relates generally to social networking systems and more specifically to granting permission to act on behalf of a user in a social networking system.

A social networking system allows its users to connect to and communicate with other social networking system users. Users may create profiles on a social networking system that are tied to their identities and include information about the users such as interests and demographic information. The users may be individuals or entities such as corporations or charities. Social networking systems maintain a significant amount of user specific information and information describing relationships between users on the social networking system. To allow users to regulate access to their information by other users many social networking systems allow their users to grant or deny access to user specific information based on relationships between the users.

Conventionally social networking systems typically allow businesses and other entities to maintain the same presence on social networking systems as individual users by allowing administrators authorized to act on behalf of entities to create and maintain information associated with the entities. For example administrators may create advertisements create posts respond to comments and perform other activities on the social networking system on behalf of an entity. However conventional social networking systems do not allow entities customize the roles of administrators based on the relationships between the administrators and entities or on the experience levels of various administrators.

Further conventional social networking systems also do not allow an entity to extend permission to act on its behalf to users associated with a different entity that has a relationship with the entity. For example a conventional social networking system does not allow a retailer to grant an employee of an advertising agency permission to access information about funding sources of the retailer s advertising based on the retailer s relationship to the advertising agency via the social networking system. Additionally while a conventional social networking system allow a user to specify privacy settings limiting additional users ability to access information maintained by social networking system and associated with the user conventional social networking systems do not allow the user to maintain separate sets of information associated with the user and regulate access of additional users to the sets of information based on a type of connection between the user and an additional user.

To allow a business or other entity to delegate or regulate actions that social networking system users may perform on behalf of the business or entity a social networking system allows an entity to associate one or more roles with a user of the social networking system. A role is associated with one or more actions that a user associated with the role is authorized to perform on behalf of the entity. Various permissions are associated with a role to allow a user associated with the role to perform one or more of the actions associated with the role. Additionally a role associated with a user may allow a user to assign a subset of the permissions associated with the role to one or more additional users allowing an additional user to perform actions associated with the rule limited by the subset of permissions assigned to the additional user. For example when a role is assigned to a business the business may assign permissions associated with the role to various employees of the business. In one embodiment a user associated with a role is limited to assigning permissions to other users having specified types of connections to the user. For example a business associated with a role is limited to assigning permissions to users that are employees of the business and is not allowed to assign permissions to users having other types of connections to the business.

An entity may assign a role to a user through various methods. For example an entity associates a role with a user in response to the entity receiving a request for the role from the user. Alternatively an entity may assign a role to a user on its own initiative. An entity may associate roles with various types of users with certain roles associated with certain types of users. For example an entity may associate a role with a business an individual an organization a group a charity or any other type of user of the social networking system. In some embodiments when an entity associates a role with a user the user associates a reciprocal role with the entity for example if an entity associates a role of advertiser with a user the user associates a role of client with the entity.

In one embodiment to identify roles associated with a user by an entity the social networking system maintains a connection between the user and the entity that identifies one or more roles associated with the user by the entity allowing the user to perform actions on the social networking system on behalf of the entity that are authorized by permissions associated with the role. For example a business associates a user with a role of advertiser in response to receiving a request from the user to be assigned the role and the social networking system maintains a connection between the user and entity identifying the role and one or more permissions associated with the role. When the user attempts to perform an action via the social networking system on behalf of the entity the permissions associated with the connection are identified to determine whether the user is authorized to perform the action.

An entity may be associated with various types of assets corresponding to different types of information or content maintained by the social networking system. Different types of assets may be associated with different roles allowing the entity to assign roles to a user based on types of assets associated with the entity. Example types of assets include pages advertising accounts funding sources groups of custom audiences etc. Hence an entity may assign roles to various users on a per asset basis. For example roles associated with a page asset include content creator administrator or moderator. As another example roles associated with an advertising account asset include advertisement creator and advertisement administrator.

Additionally the social networking system maintains various types of information about a user in a user profile associated with the user. For example a user profile includes biographic and demographic information interests connections to other users and may include additional information such as images videos notes appointments etc. To allow a user to more effectively perform actions associated with a role the social networking system may generate a persona associated with the user. The persona hides a subset of information included in the user profile associated with the user from users connected to the persona. Hence a persona is associated with a user profile and includes information provided or specified by the user as accessible by additional users connected to the profile. Accordingly the persona may limit access to information associated with the user to information for use in a role associated with the user. For example a user s user name and contact e mail address associated with a persona may differ from the user s user name and contact e mail address used for connections with the user s user profile maintained by the social networking system. Multiple personas may be associated with a single user profile allowing the user to customize the information associated with the user that is accessible to different additional users.

The figures depict various embodiments for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles described herein.

The client devices are one or more computing devices capable of receiving user input as well as transmitting and or receiving data via the network . In one embodiment a client device is a conventional computer system such as a desktop or a laptop computer. Alternatively a client device may be a device having computer functionality such as a personal digital assistant PDA a mobile telephone a smartphone or another suitable device. A client device is configured to communicate via the network . In one embodiment a client device executes an application allowing a user of the client device to interact with the social networking system . For example a client device executes a browser application to enable interaction between the client device and the social networking system via the network . In another embodiment a client device interacts with the social networking system through an application programming interface API running on a native operating system of the client device such as IOS or ANDROID .

The client devices are configured to communicate via the network which may comprise any combination of local area and or wide area networks using both wired and or wireless communication systems. In one embodiment the network uses standard communications technologies and or protocols. For example the network includes communication links using technologies such as Ethernet 802.11 worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX 3G 4G code division multiple access CDMA digital subscriber line DSL etc. Examples of networking protocols used for communicating via the network include multiprotocol label switching MPLS transmission control protocol Internet protocol TCP IP hypertext transport protocol HTTP simple mail transfer protocol SMTP and file transfer protocol FTP . Data exchanged over the network may be represented using any suitable format such as hypertext markup language HTML or extensible markup language XML . In some embodiments all or some of the communication links of the network may be encrypted using any suitable technique or techniques.

One or more third party systems may be coupled to the network for communicating with the social networking system which is further described below in conjunction with . In one embodiment a third party system is an application provider communicating information describing applications for execution by a client device or communicating data to client devices for use by an application executing on the client device. In other embodiments a third party system provides content or other information for presentation via a client device . A third party system may also communicate information to the social networking system such as advertisements content or information about an application provided by the third party system .

Each user of the social networking system is associated with a user profile which is stored in the user profile store . A user profile includes declarative information about the user that was explicitly shared by the user and may also include profile information inferred by the social networking system . In one embodiment a user profile includes multiple data fields each describing one or more attributes of the corresponding social networking system user. Examples of information stored in a user profile include biographic demographic and other types of descriptive information such as work experience educational history gender hobbies or preferences location and the like. A user profile may also store other information provided by the user for example images or videos. In certain embodiments images of users may be tagged with information identifying the social networking system users displayed in an image. A user profile in the user profile store may also maintain references to actions by the corresponding user performed on content items in the content store and stored in the action log .

Additionally the user profile store stores one or more personas associated with a user profile. A persona includes a subset of information associated with a user profile maintained by the social networking system so additional users authorized to access the persona have access to the subset of information in the persona rather than the information in the user profile. As further described below in conjunction with a persona allows certain information associated with a user profile associated with a user to be hidden from certain social networking system users to which the user is connected.

While user profiles in the user profile store are frequently associated with individuals allowing individuals to interact with each other via the social networking system user profiles may also be stored for entities such as businesses or organizations. This allows an entity to establish a presence on the social networking system for connecting and exchanging content with other social networking system users. The entity may post information about itself about its products or provide other information to users of the social networking system using a brand page associated with the entity s user profile. Other users of the social networking system may connect to the brand page to receive information posted to the brand page or to receive information from the brand page. A user profile associated with the brand page may include information about the entity itself providing users with background or informational data about the entity.

The content store stores objects that each represent various types of content. Examples of content represented by an object include a page post a status update a photograph a video a link a shared content item a gaming application achievement a check in event at a local business a brand page or any other type of content. Social networking system users may create objects stored by the content store such as status updates photos tagged by users to be associated with other objects in the social networking system events groups or applications. In some embodiments objects are received from third party applications or third party applications separate from the social networking system . In one embodiment objects in the content store represent single pieces of content or content items. Hence social networking system users are encouraged to communicate with each other by posting text and content items of various types of media to the social networking system through various communication channels. This increases the amount of interaction of users with each other and increases the frequency with which users interact within the social networking system .

The action logger receives communications about user actions internal to and or external to the social networking system populating the action log with information about user actions. Examples of actions include adding a connection to another user sending a message to another user uploading an image reading a message from another user viewing content associated with another user and attending an event posted by another user. In addition a number of actions may involve an object and one or more particular users so these actions are associated with those users as well and stored in the action log .

The action log may be used by the social networking system to track user actions on the social networking system as well as actions on third party systems that communicate information to the social networking system . Users may interact with various objects on the social networking system and information describing these interactions is stored in the action log . Examples of interactions with objects include commenting on posts sharing links checking in to physical locations via a mobile device accessing content items and any other suitable interactions. Additional examples of interactions with objects on the social networking system that are included in the action log include commenting on a photo album communicating with a user establishing a connection with an object joining an event joining a group creating an event authorizing an application using an application expressing a preference for an object liking the object and engaging in a transaction. Additionally the action log may record a user s interactions with advertisements on the social networking system as well as with other applications operating on the social networking system . In some embodiments data from the action log is used to infer interests or preferences of a user augmenting the interests included in the user s user profile and allowing a more complete understanding of user preferences.

The action log may also store user actions taken on a third party system such as an external website and communicated to the social networking system . For example an e commerce website may recognize a user of a social networking system through a social plug in enabling the e commerce website to identify the user of the social networking system . Because users of the social networking system are uniquely identifiable e commerce websites such as in the preceding example may communicate information about a user s actions outside of the social networking system to the social networking system for association with the user. Hence the action log may record information about actions users perform on a third party system including webpage viewing histories advertisements that were engaged purchases made and other patterns from shopping and buying.

In one embodiment the edge store stores information describing connections between users and other objects on the social networking system as edges. Some edges may be defined by users allowing users to specify their relationships with other users. For example users may generate edges with other users that parallel the users real life relationships such as friends co workers partners and so forth. Other edges are generated when users interact with objects in the social networking system such as expressing interest in a page on the social networking system sharing a link with other users of the social networking system and commenting on posts made by other users of the social networking system .

In one embodiment an edge may include various features each representing characteristics of interactions between users interactions between users and objects or interactions between objects. For example features included in an edge describe rate of interaction between two users how recently two users have interacted with each other the rate or amount of information retrieved by one user about an object or the number and types of comments posted by a user about an object. The features may also represent information describing a particular object or user. For example a feature may represent the level of interest that a user has in a particular topic the rate at which the user logs into the social networking system or information describing demographic information about a user. Each feature may be associated with a source object or user a target object or user and a feature value. A feature may be specified as an expression based on values describing the source object or user the target object or user or interactions between the source object or user and target object or user hence an edge may be represented as one or more feature expressions. In some embodiment information identifying one or more roles or permissions associated with roles is stored in association with an edge. For example information identifying actions a user is authorized to perform on behalf of an additional user and identifying the additional user is associated with an edge.

The edge store also stores information about edges such as affinity scores for objects interests and other users. Affinity scores or affinities may be computed by the social networking system over time to approximate a user s interest in an object or another user in the social networking system based on the actions performed by the user. A user s affinity may be computed by the social networking system over time to approximate a user s interest for an object interest or other user in the social networking system based on the actions performed by the user. Computation of affinity is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 978 265 filed on Dec. 23 2010 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 690 254 filed on Nov. 30 2012 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 689 969 filed on Nov. 30 2012 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 690 088 filed on Nov. 30 2012 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Multiple interactions between a user and a specific object may be stored as a single edge in the edge store in one embodiment. Alternatively each interaction between a user and a specific object is stored as a separate edge. In some embodiments connections between users may be stored in the user profile store or the user profile store may access the edge store to determine connections between users.

The role association module associates roles with users. Additionally the role association module associates one or more permissions comprising a role with a user. Different roles may be associated with different types of assets allowing a user to associate other users with roles based on a type of asset associated with the user. Similarly different assets may be associated with more than one type of role which may be associated with more than one type of permission. Types of assets correspond to different types of information or content maintained by the social networking system in the content store . Example types of assets include pages groups of users advertising accounts applications events funding sources and any other suitable types of information or content maintained by the social networking system . A funding source may be associated with a maximum spending limit which may be based on a role assigned to a user granted permission to authorize payments from the funding source hence different users may have different maximum spending limits for a funding source based on roles associated with various users. For example a funding source is associated with a maximum spending limit of 10 000 for a user assigned an advertiser role and is associated with a maximum spending limit of 500 for a user assigned a content creator role. Example types of roles include content creator administrator moderator and advertiser.

Different types of roles are associated with different sets of permissions that enable a user assigned a role and connected to an entity to perform one or more actions on behalf of the entity to perform one or more actions associated with the role based on the permissions associated with the role via the social networking system . Examples of types of permissions include permission to access advertising insights permission to authorize payments from a funding source permission to create content permission to contact users and third parties on behalf of an additional user and permission to create an advertisement. In some embodiments a user assigning a role e.g. an entity may customize permissions associated with a role by adding or removing permissions similarly a user may add or remove roles associated with types of assets. For example an organization assigning a role of content creator to a user may specify that the user receive authorization from the organization prior to posting content on the social networking system by removing a permission to publish content from a set of permissions associated with a role of content creator.

The web server links the social networking system via the network to the one or more client devices as well as to the one or more third party systems . The web server serves web pages as well as other content such as JAVA FLASH XML and so forth. The web server may receive and route messages between the social networking system and the client device for example instant messages queued messages e.g. email text messages short message service SMS messages or messages sent using any other suitable messaging technique. A user may send a request to the web server to upload information e.g. images or videos that are stored in the content store . Additionally the web server may provide application programming interface API functionality to send data directly to native client device operating systems such as IOS ANDROID WEBOS or BlackberryOS.

Stored information associated with the user may also associate different roles with different types of assets or with individual assets. Example types of roles include content creator administrator moderator and advertiser. For example roles associated with a page asset include content creator administrator and moderator while an example role associated with an advertising account asset is an advertiser. A role is associated with a set of permissions allowing a user associated with the role to perform one or more actions corresponding to the role hence permissions allow a user to perform one or more actions associated with an asset on behalf of another user on the social networking system . Associating different roles with different types of assets allows a user to regulate interactions of other users with specific assets or asset types. For example if multiple types of assets are associated with a business the business may grant all or a subset of permissions associated with a role to a user as a set of permissions rather than determining what types of individual permissions may be granted to the user.

The social networking system receives a request to assign a role to a target user. In various embodiments the request is received from a user capable of granting one or more permissions associated with a role e.g. an organization a target user to be associated with a role or an additional user that is requesting association of a role with an additional user e.g. an employee of an organization requesting association of role with another employee . For example if the user is an organization the organization may request to assign a role to a user connected to the organization such as an employee an independent contractor a vendor etc. As an additional example a user connected to an organization may request to be assigned a role by the organization or request that the organization assign a role to an additional user. The request may include information identifying a type of asset e.g. page funding source group of users advertising account etc. or identifying one or more permissions associated with the requested role e.g. permissions to access advertising insights permissions to authorize payments from a funding source permissions to create content on the social networking system permissions to contact users and third parties on behalf of an additional user or entity permissions to create an advertisement etc. .

In an embodiment the role identified by the request or permissions associated with the role identified by the request may depend on one or more assets identified by the request. For example a role for creating content associated with a request depends on whether an asset identified in the request is a page or an advertising account as different roles may be associated with the page and the advertising account such as page content creator or advertisement creator respectively. As an additional example if a business requests assignment of a role to create an advertisement for the business to an organization the request identifies assets of an advertising account and a funding source. Based on these assets the social networking system determines that the role assigned to the organization is advertising agency and the permissions associated with the role are permissions to create an advertisement permissions to access advertising insights and permissions to authorize payments from the funding source. In some embodiments a user assigning a role to a target user may add remove or otherwise modify one or more roles associated with types of assets or may add remove or otherwise modify permissions associated with roles. In the preceding example the business assigning the role of advertising agency to the organization may specify that the organization is required to receive authorization from the business for payments from the funding source by removing the permission to authorize payments from the funding source from the set of permissions associated with the role.

In one embodiment one or more permissions associated with a role may be identified as delegable allowing a user to delegate those permissions to one or more additional users. Thus a user identifies delegable permissions associated with a role in the request the target user may delegate a subset of those permissions to various additional users when the target user is assigned the role allowing portions of an action associated with the role to be performed by the additional users to which the permissions are delegated. For example if a business assigning a role of advertising agency to an organization specifies that one or more permissions associated with the role are delegable the organization may hire a contractor to create an advertisement and assign permission to create an advertisement to the contractor while retaining permissions associated with the role.

The social networking system determines whether to associate the role with the target user identified by the request. Association of a role with a target user may be based at least in part on a connection between the target user and the user. For example the social networking system determines whether a connection between the target user and the user exists and a type of connection between the target user and the user to determine whether to associate the role with the target user. For example a content creator role requested to be associated with a target user by a business is associated with the target user if the user is connected to the business via the social networking system and information stored by the social networking system identifies the target user as an employee of the business. As an additional example a requested role of administrator of a business is not associated with a target user if the social networking system does not include a connection between the business and the target user or if a connection between the business and the target user is maintained by the social networking system but the connection does not identify the target user as having administrative authority to act on behalf of the business e.g. the user is a former employee or is an intern not currently working for the business .

Alternatively the request may be communicated to the user allowing the user to determine whether to associate the role with the target user. Based on the user s response to the request the social networking system determines whether to associate the role with the target user. The request may be communicated to the user through e mail instant message text message or any other suitable form of communication. In one embodiment the request is communicated to the user after determining that the user has a specified type of connection with the target user if a connection between the user and the target user is not a specified type the request is not communicated to the user limiting association of roles to target users having specific types of connections to the user.

If the social networking system determines to associate the role with the target user the social networking system stores one or more permissions associated with the connection between the user and the target user. Stored permissions are associated with the role and allow the target user to perform one or more actions associated with the role on behalf of the user via the social networking system . Information about the role and its associated permissions may be stored in an edge between nodes representing the user and the target user in a graph maintained by the social networking system . This information may be subsequently retrieved by the social networking system when the target user attempts to perform an action on behalf of the user to determine whether the target user is authorized to perform the attempted action on behalf of the user. For example if a user is associated with a role of advertiser by a business and the user attempts to access advertising insights for the business the social networking system retrieves information associated with a connection between the user and the business to determine whether permissions associated with the user by the business authorize the user to access the advertising insights or prevent the user from accessing the advertising insights.

In one embodiment a persona is created for the target user allowing permissions associated with the role to be associated with a connection between the user and the target user maintained by the social networking system . A persona includes a subset of information associated with a user profile associated with the target user maintained by the social networking system limiting information associated with the target user that is accessible to additional users connected to the persona. For example a subset of information in the target user s user profile or a subset of the user s connections to other users are associated with the persona limiting access of other users connected to the persona to the subset of information or the subset of connections associated with the persona rather than the user s complete user profile. The target user may create the persona or the social networking system may create the persona and the target user may customize the created persona by specifying information included in the persona and users connected to the target user to which the persona is presented in lieu of the target user s user profile. For example rather than allowing businesses to which a user is connected to view all the user s complete user profile the social networking system allows the user to create a persona limiting information associated with the user accessible to businesses to information that is relevant for business purposes e.g. a business logo rather than a profile picture a business e mail address and phone number rather than a personal e mail address and phone number the user s business connections rather than social connections etc. .

A persona is associated with a user s social networking system user profile and stored in the user profile store . For example a user accesses information associated with a persona associated with their user profile when accessing the social networking system . Multiple personas may be associated with a single user profile. For example a user who is a student and a business owner may create a persona associated with a set of information relevant to the user s business connections or roles and another persona associated with a set of information relevant to the user s academic connections or roles.

The target user may further assign roles or permissions associated with one or more of its associated roles to additional users. For example if the target user is a business entity e.g. an advertising agency the target user may further assign roles to additional users connected to the target user e.g. employees of the target user and associate a subset of the permissions associated with one or more roles associated with the target user to additional users to additional users. In one embodiment the target user is limited to assigning roles and their associated permissions to additional users having a particular type of connection to the target user e.g. employees and additional users having different types of connections to the target user e.g. independent contractors . If the social networking system determines that a connection between the user and an additional user is not sufficient to authorize the assignment of a subset of roles or permissions originally assigned or granted to the user the subset of roles or permissions is not associated with a connection between the user and the additional user.

The social networking system communicates denial of the request to assign the role to the target user if it determines that the role should to not be associated with the target user. For example if the connection between the target user and the user is not a specific type necessary for the role to be associated with the target user an indication that the role has not been assigned to the target user is communicated to the user from which the request was received. The denial may be communicated via e mail instant message text message or any other suitable form of communication. Denial of the request to assign the role may also be communicated if the user declines to associate the role with the target user. For example if a junior software engineer requests to be assigned a role of content creator for a business the business will deny the request though the requesting user is an employee of the business if the business reserves the role of content creator for senior software engineers. In this example based on the denial of the request to assign the role by the business the social networking system communicates denial of the request to the requesting user.
