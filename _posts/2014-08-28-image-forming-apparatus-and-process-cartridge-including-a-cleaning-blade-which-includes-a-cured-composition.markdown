The developing device contains a developing roller . To the developing roller developing bias is applied from a power source not illustrated . In a casing of the developing device provided are a supply screw and a stirring screw which are configured to stir a developer housed in the casing while transporting in the mutually different direction. Moreover also provided is a doctor configured to regulate the developer held on the developing roller . The toner in the developer stirred and transported by the supply screw and the stirring screw is charged to the predetermined polarity. The developer is then scooped on a surface of the developing roller the scooped developer is regulated by the doctor and the toner is deposited on an electrostatic latent image formed on a surface of the image bearing member in the developing region facing to the image bearing member .

The cleaning device contains a cleaning blade . The cleaning blade is brought into contact with the image bearing member in the counter direction relative to the traveling direction of the surface of the image bearing member .

The press force of the cleaning blade to the surface of the image bearing member is typically 10 N m to 100 N m preferably 10 N m to 50 N m. When the press force of the cleaning blade to the surface of the image bearing member is 10 N m or greater a cleaning failure which is caused by passing a toner through a contact area between the cleaning blade and the image bearing member can be prevented. When the press force of the cleaning blade to the surface of the image bearing member is 100 N m less frictions at the contact area between the cleaning blade and the image bearing member are reduced and therefore roll up of the cleaning blade can be prevented.

Note that the press force of the cleaning blade to the surface of the image bearing member can be measured by means of a measuring device in which a compact compression load cell manufactured by Kyowa Electronic Instruments Co. is mounted.

The lubricant coating device is equipped with a solid lubricant and a lubricant press spring and is further equipped with a fur brush configured to apply the solid lubricant to a surface of the image bearing member . The solid lubricant is held by a bracket and is pressed to the side of the fur brush by the lubricant press spring . Then the solid lubricant is scraped with the fur brush which rotates in the dragging direction relative to the rotational direction of the image bearing member and the scraped lubricant is applied to the surface of the image bearing member . As a result the friction coefficient of the surface of the image bearing member is maintained to 0.2 or less when an image is not formed.

Note that the charging device is that of a non contact adjacent setting type where the charging roller is provided adjacent to the image bearing member . However the charging device may be corotron scorotron or a solid state charger.

A light source of laser light L of the exposure unit and a light source of the diselectrification lamp are not particularly limited and examples thereof include a fluorescent lamp a tungsten lamp a halogen lamp a mercury lamp a sodium lamp a light emitting diode LED a laser diode LD and an electroluminescent EL lamp. Among them preferred are a laser diode LD and a light emitting diode LED because they can apply light having a wavelength of 600 nm to 800 nm.

A filter may be used in combination with the exposure unit in order to apply only light having the desired wavelength range.

The filter is not particularly limited and examples thereof include a sharp cut filter a band filter a near infrared cut filter a dichroic filter an interference filter and a color temperature conversion filter.

The transfer unit is equipped with an intermediate transfer belt a cleaning unit a first bracket and a second bracket . Moreover the transfer unit is further equipped with primary transfer rollers Y C M K a secondary transfer back up roller a driving roller a support roller and a tension roller .

The intermediate transfer belt rotates in an anticlockwise direction in the drawing by the rotational driving of the driving roller while supported by the primary transfer rollers Y C M K the secondary transfer back up roller the driving roller the support roller and the tension roller . The primary transfer rollers Y C M K nip the intermediate transfer belt with the image bearing members Y C M K respectively to thereby form primary transfer nips respectively. Then a transfer bias having an opposite polarity to that of the toner is applied to the back surface of the intermediate transfer belt the internal perimeter surface of the loop . In the process that the intermediate transfer belt successively passes through the primary transfer nips the toner images formed on the surfaces of the image bearing members Y C M K are superimposed on the surface of the intermediate transfer belt the outer perimeter surface of the loop to thereby perform primary transfer. As a result the toner image superimposed toner images is formed on the surface of the intermediate transfer belt .

The secondary transfer back up roller nips the intermediate transfer belt with the secondary transfer roller provided at the outer side of the loop of the intermediate transfer belt to thereby form a secondary transfer nip. A pair of registration rollers sends a recording medium P which has been nipped between the pair of the registration rollers to the secondary transfer nip at timing to synchronize to the toner image formed on the surface of the intermediate transfer belt . The toner image formed on the surface of the intermediate transfer belt is secondary transferred to the recording medium P in the secondary transfer nip by influences of a secondary transfer electric field formed between the secondary transfer roller and the secondary transfer back up roller to which secondary transfer bias is applied or nip pressure.

The toner which has not been transferred to the recording medium P is deposited on the intermediate transfer belt which has passed through the secondary transfer nip. Therefore the intermediate transfer belt is cleaned by the cleaning unit . Note that the cleaning unit contains a cleaning blade that is brought into contact with the surface of the intermediate transfer belt the outer perimeter surface of the loop to scrape and remove the toner remained on the intermediate transfer belt .

The first bracket is rocked at the predetermined rotational angle by on off driving of a solenoid not illustrated with the rotational axis of the support roller as a center. In the case where the 500 forms a monochromic image the first bracket is rotated only a little in an anticlockwise direction in the drawing by the driving of the solenoid. Specifically the intermediate transfer belt is separated from the image bearing members Y C M by rotating the primary transfer rollers Y C M in the anticlockwise direction in the drawing with the rotational axis of the support roller being a center. Then a monochromic image is formed by driving only the image forming unit K. As a result consumptions of other members which will be caused by driving the image forming units Y C M can be avoided when a monochromic image is formed.

The fixing unit is provided at the upper side of the secondary transfer nip in the drawing. The fixing unit is equipped with a press heat roller which includes therein a heat source such as a halogen lamp and a fixing belt unit . The fixing belt unit has a fixing belt a heat roller which includes therein a heat source such as a halogen lamp a tension roller a driving roller and a temperature sensor not illustrated . The fixing belt travels in an anticlockwise direction in the drawing with supported by the heat roller the tension roller and the driving roller .

In this process the fixing belt is heated from the side of the back surface the internal perimeter surface of the loop by the heat roller . The press heat roller which is rotationally driven in the clockwise direction in the drawing is brought into contact with the surface of the fixing belt the outer perimeter surface of the loop at the position where the fixing belt is supported by the heat roller . As a result a fixing nip at which the press heat roller and the fixing belt are brought into contact with each other is formed.

The temperature sensor not illustrated is provided at the outer side of the loop of the fixing belt in the manner that the temperature sensor faces to the surface of the fixing belt the outer perimeter of the loop with the predetermined space and the temperature sensor detects the surface temperature of the fixing belt just before entering the fixing nip. The detected result is sent to the fixing power source circuit not illustrated . The fixing power source circuit controls with on off a heat source included in the heat roller or a heat source included in the press heat roller based on the detected result of the temperature sensor.

Meanwhile the recording medium P passed through the secondary transfer nip P is separated from the intermediate transfer belt followed by sending the recording medium P into the fixing unit . The recording medium P is then nipped at the fixing nip in the fixing unit to be transported from the bottom side to the upper side in the drawing. In this process the recording medium P is heated as well as pressed by the fixing belt to thereby fix the toner image onto the recording medium P.

The recording medium P to which the toner is fixed is passed through a pair of discharge rollers and is then discharged outside the apparatus. A stacking unit is formed on the top surface of the housing of the main body of the image forming apparatus . The recording media P discharged outside the apparatus by the pair of the discharge rollers are sequentially stacked in the stacking unit .

Toner cartridges Y C M K each configured to house therein a toner are provided above the transfer unit . The toners in the toner cartridges Y C M K are appropriately supplied to the developing devices Y C M K respectively. The toner cartridges Y C M K are mounted independently to the image forming units Y C M K and can be detachably mounted in the main body of the image forming apparatus .

Once a signal for a print execution from an operation unit not illustrated is received first the predetermined voltage or electric current is applied to the charging roller and the developing roller successively at the predetermined timings. Similarly the predetermined voltage or electric current is applied to a light source of the exposure unit and a light source of the diselectrification lamp successively at the predetermined timings. In the synchronized motions to this the image bearing member is rotationally driven in the direction shown with the arrow in the drawing by the driving motor not illustrated .

Once the image bearing member is rotated in the direction shown with the arrow in the drawing a surface of the image bearing member is uniformly charge to the predetermined potential by the charging roller . Then laser light L is applied to the surface of the image bearing member from the exposure unit corresponding to the image information. As a result the area of the surface of the image bearing member to which the laser light L is applied is discharged to thereby form an electrostatic latent image.

The surface of the image bearing member on which the electrostatic latent image has been formed is rubbed by a magnetic brush that is composed of a developer formed on the developing roller in the region facing to the developing device . In this operation the charged toner on the developing roller is transported to the side of the elastic latent image by the predetermined developing bias applied to the developing roller to thereby develop the electrostatic latent image. The similar image forming process is performed in the image forming units Y C M K and the toner images of respective colors are formed on the surfaces of the image bearing members Y C M K.

As mentioned above the electrostatic latent image formed on the surface of the image bearing member is reverse developed with the charged toner by the developing device in the image forming apparatus .

Note that an N P negative positive non contact charging roller system where a toner is deposited on an area having the lower potential is explained above but a system for use is not limited to the aforementioned system.

The toner images of respective colors formed on the surfaces of the image bearing members Y C M K are sequentially primary transferred so that they are superimposed on a surface of the intermediate transfer belt . As a result the toner image superimposed toner images is formed on the surface of the intermediate transfer belt .

The toner image formed on the surface of the intermediate transfer belt is transferred to a recording medium P which is fed from the first paper feeding cassette or the second paper feeding cassette and is fed to the secondary transfer nip with going through between the pair of the registration rollers . During this operation the recording medium P is temporarily stopped with being nipped between the pair of the registration rollers is synchronized with the edge of the image on the intermediate transfer belt and is supplied to the secondary transfer nip. The recording medium P to which the toner image has been transferred is separated from the intermediate transfer belt and is sent to the fixing unit . As the recording medium P to which the toner image has been transferred passes through the fixing unit the toner image is fixed on the recording medium P by heat and pressure. The recording medium P to which the toner image has been fixed is discharged outside the image forming apparatus and is stacked in the stacking unit .

Meanwhile the toner remained on the surface of the intermediate transfer belt from which the toner image has been transferred to the recording medium P at the secondary transfer nip is removed by the cleaning unit .

Moreover the toner remained on the surface of the image bearing member from which the toner image has been transferred to the intermediate transfer belt at the primary transfer nip has been removed by the cleaning device . Thereafter a lubricant is applied to the surface of the image bearing member by the lubricant coating device followed by discharging the surface thereof by the diselectrification lamp.

The image forming unit is composed of the image bearing member the charging roller serving as a process unit the developing device the cleaning device and the lubricant coating device all of which are housed in a frame body . The image forming unit is detachably mounted as a process cartridge in the main body of the image forming apparatus .

In the image forming apparatus the image forming unit has a configuration that the image bearing member and process units are integratedly exchanged as a process cartridge.
