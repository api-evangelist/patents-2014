title: Margin-based optimization systems and methods in optical networks by intentionally reducing margin
abstract: Systems and methods of optimizing capacity of an optical network, through intentionally reducing margin on one or more wavelengths, include identifying a first wavelength capable of using excess capacity; determining the one or more wavelengths that have extra margin; adjusting at least one of the one or more wavelengths to reduce associated margin to a nominal margin so as to increase supportable capacity of the first wavelength; and increasing capacity of the first wavelength based on the supportable capacity.
