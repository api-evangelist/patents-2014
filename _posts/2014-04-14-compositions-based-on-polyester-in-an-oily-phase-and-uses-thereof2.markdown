This application is a continuation of U.S. Ser. No. 12 995 609 filed Dec. 1 2010 allowed and incorporated herein by reference which was a National Stage of PCT EP09 056611 filed May 29 2009 and claims the benefit of U.S. application Ser. No. 61 060 489 filed Jun. 11 2008 and FR 0853631 filed Jun. 2 2008.

The present invention relates to a cosmetic make up or care composition comprising an oily phase comprising at least one liquid polyester obtained by condensation of unsaturated fatty acid dimer and or trimer and of diol said composition being free from lipophilic gelling agent or containing at the most 10 wt. thereof relative to the weight of the composition. The present invention also relates to a method of make up of the face and body comprising the use of said composition.

It is common to find in cosmetic or dermatological products a structured liquid phase namely gelled and or stiffened. This is in particular the case in solid compositions especially solid cast compositions lip balms lipsticks eye shadows concealers and cast foundations or gelled compositions such as lip glosses. This structuring can be obtained using waxes fillers mineral silica or pyrogenic silica which is hydrophobic for example. The structuring can also be obtained with compounds which contribute consistency to the cosmetic composition by virtue of their high viscosity such as sucrose esters. However the formulations thus obtained are not completely satisfactory in terms of texture and also exhibit the disadvantage of being excessively slippery with an excessively greasy structure and in the case of a coloured composition the distribution of the colour may prove to be heterogeneous after application. Furthermore in order to improve the persistence of the deposit on the lips use is generally made of gloss oils which are viscous. These gloss oils exhibit the disadvantage of being very sticky and thus not very comfortable. In addition the gloss of the cosmetic compositions structured with mineral silica or waxes is not completely satisfactory in view of their mattifying aspect.

The present invention results more particularly from the surprising observation by the inventors that an oily phase can be structured by a liquid polyester obtained by condensation of unsaturated fatty acid dimer and or trimer and diol as with a gelling agent conventionally used for this purpose. Thus it is no longer necessary to add a large amount of lipophilic gelling agents. In addition the cosmetic make up or care composition comprising said oily phase comprising said liquid polyester exhibits the advantage of being pleasant when applied and not very sticky while exhibiting little or no migration. It also exhibits a homogeneous appearance with an entirely satisfactory distribution in the colour while exhibiting a high gloss and an improved durability of the gloss and of the colour over time. The compositions of the invention thus exhibit a particularly satisfactory appearance while being particularly comfortable.

The invention therefore relates to a cosmetic or skin care composition comprising an oily phase in particular a liquid oily phase comprising at least one liquid polyester obtained by condensation of unsaturated fatty acid dimer and or trimer and of diol said composition being free from lipophilic gelling agent or containing at the most 10 wt. thereof relative to the weight of the composition.

The invention also relates to a method of make up or of care of the skin lips and or of the integumentary appendages comprising the application on these parts of a composition according to the invention.

The present invention relates to a cosmetic make up or care composition comprising an oily phase comprising at least one liquid polyester obtained by condensation of unsaturated fatty acid dimer and or trimer and of diol said composition being free from lipophilic gelling agent or containing at the most 10 wt. thereof relative to the weight of the composition.

The composition according to the invention can notably take the form of a foundation a blusher or eye shadow a concealer a blush a loose or compacted powder a lipstick a lip balm a lip gloss a lip or eye pencil a mascara an eye liner a nail varnish or a product for make up of the body or for colouring the skin.

Preferably the cosmetic or skin care composition according to the invention is a lipstick or a lip gloss.

The composition according to the invention includes at least one liquid polyester obtained by condensation of unsaturated fatty acid dimer and or trimer and of diol.

The inventors have observed that such polyesters exhibit advantageous properties like lipophilic gelling agents conventionally used to structure the oily phases of cosmetic products. It has in particular been observed that the structure obtained with these polyesters is satisfactory as particularly pleasant during application and not very sticky while exhibiting little or no migration. The cosmetic compositions obtained with the polyester of the invention are thus particularly comfortable.

 Liquid polyester means a polyester that begins to flow under its own weight in less than one minute at room temperature 25 C. 

 Unsaturated fatty acids means within the context of the present invention mono or polyunsaturated fatty acids having from 14 to 22 carbon atoms.

Preferably the unsaturated fatty acid dimers and or trimers are polycarboxylic acids comprising at least 2 and up to 6 carboxylic acid functions per molecule. In a preferred embodiment the unsaturated fatty acid dimer can contain from 28 to 44 carbon atoms and 2 carboxylic acid functions. The unsaturated fatty acid trimer can contain from 42 to 66 carbon atoms and 3 carboxylic acid functions. Preferably an unsaturated fatty acid dimer is used in particular having 36 carbon atoms and 2 carboxylic acid functions.

Mixtures of unsaturated fatty acid dimers and trimers and or of unsaturated fatty acid not polymerized therefore corresponding to a monomer can also be employed within the scope of the invention. In the case of such a mixture preference is given to a mixture containing more than 50 wt. of dimers for example a mixture containing more than 90 wt. preferably more than 95 of acids in the form of dimers and the rest of the mixture can be trimers and or monomers of unsaturated fatty acids.

In the sense of the invention the melting point corresponds to the temperature of the most endothermic peak observed in thermal analysis DSC as described in standard ISO 11357 3 1999. The melting point of a pasty substance or of a wax can be measured using a differential scanning calorimeter DSC for example the calorimeter sold under the designation MDSC 2920 by the company TA Instruments.

A 5 mg sample of pasty substance or wax according to the case placed in a crucible is submitted to a first temperature rise from 20 C. to 100 C. at a heating rate of 10 C. minute then it is cooled from 100 C. to 20 C. at a cooling rate of 10 C. minute and is finally submitted to a second temperature rise from 20 C. to 100 C. at a heating rate of 5 C. minute. During the second temperature rise we measure the variation of the difference in power absorbed by the empty crucible and by the crucible containing the sample of pasty substance or wax as a function of the temperature. The melting point of the compound is the value of the temperature corresponding to the top of the peak of the curve representing the variation of the difference of power absorbed as a function of the temperature.

The liquid fraction of the pasty compound measured at 32 C. is equal to the ratio of the enthalpy of fusion consumed at 32 C. to the enthalpy of fusion of the pasty compound. The enthalpy of fusion consumed at 32 C. is calculated in the same way as the enthalpy of fusion consumed at 23 C.

The composition according to the invention can contain at least one goniochromatic colorant which can have magnetic properties if necessary.

 Goniochromatic colorant denotes in the sense of the present invention a colorant able to give when the composition is spread out on a substrate a colour path in the a b plane of the CIE 1976 colorimetric space that corresponds to a change Dh in the hue angle h of at least 20 when the angle of observation relative to the normal is varied between 0 and 80 for an angle of incidence of the light of 45 .

The colour path can be measured for example by means of a spectrogonioreflectometer made by INSTRUMENT SYSTEMS with the reference GON 360 GONIOMETER after the first composition has been spread out in the fluid state with a thickness of 300 m by means of an automatic spreader on a contrast card made by ERICHSEN with the reference Type 24 5 measurement being effected against the black background of the card.

The goniochromatic colorant can be selected for example from multilayer interference structures and liquid crystal colorants.

In the case of a multilayer structure this can comprise for example at least two layers each layer being made for example from at least one material selected from the group comprising the following materials MgF CeF ZnS ZnSe Si SiO Ge Te FeO Pt Va AlO MgO YO SO SiO HfO ZrO CeO NbO TaO TiO Ag Al Au Cu Rb Ti Ta W Zn MoS cryolite alloys polymers and combinations thereof.

The multilayer structure may or may not have relative to a central layer symmetry with respect to the chemical nature of the stacked layers. Different effects are obtained depending on the thickness and the nature of the various layers.

Examples of symmetric multilayer interference structures are for example the following structures FeO SiO FeO SiO FeO a pigment having this structure being marketed under the designation SICOPEARL by the company BASF MoS SiO mica oxide SiO MoS FeO SiO mica oxide SiO FeO TiO SiO TiOand TiO AlO TiO pigments having these structures being marketed under the designation XIRONA by the company MERCK Darmstadt .

The ratio of the proportion by weight of the magnetic pigments to the proportion of goniochromatic colorant is for example between and 4 for example between and 2 and for example close to 1.

The material can moreover contain dispersed goniochromatic fibres. Such fibres can for example have a length of less than 80 m.

The composition according to the invention can contain at least one diffracting pigment which can if necessary have magnetic properties.

 Diffracting pigment denotes in the sense of the present invention a pigment capable of producing a colour change depending on the angle of observation when illuminated by white light on account of the presence of a structure that diffracts the light.

A diffracting pigment can incorporate a diffraction grating capable for example of diffracting an incident ray of monochromatic light in defined directions.

The diffraction grating can include a periodic unit notably a line the distance between two adjacent units being of the same order of magnitude as the wavelength of the incident light.

When the incident light is polychromatic the diffraction grating will separate the various spectral components of the light and produce a rainbow effect.

Regarding the structure of diffracting pigments reference may usefully be made to the article of Alberto Argoitia and Matt Witzman 2002 Society of Vacuum Coaters 45Annual Technical Conference Proceedings 2002.

The diffracting pigment can be made with units having different profiles notably triangular symmetric or asymmetric with gaps of constant or variable width sinusoidal.

The spatial frequency of the grating and the depth of the units will be selected according to the degree of separation of the various orders desired. The frequency can vary for example between 500 and 3000 lines per mm.

Preferably the particles of the diffracting pigment each have a flattened shape and notably are in the form of small plates.

One and the same particle of pigment can have two crossed diffraction gratings perpendicular or otherwise.

The diffracting pigment can have a multilayer structure containing a layer of a reflective material covered at least on one side with a layer of a dielectric material. The latter can endow the diffracting pigment with better rigidity and durability. The dielectric material can then be selected for example from the following materials MgF SiO AlO AlF CeF LaF NdF SmF BaF CaF LiF and combinations thereof. The reflective material can be selected for example from the metals and metal alloys as well as from the nonmetallic reflecting materials. Among the metals that can be used we may mention Al Ag Cu Au Pt Sn Ti Pd Ni Co Rd Nb Cr and their materials combinations or alloys. Said reflective material can on its own constitute the diffracting pigment which will then be monolayered.

As a variant the diffracting pigment can have a multilayer structure comprising a core of a dielectric material covered with a reflecting layer on at least one side or even encapsulating the core completely. A layer of a dielectric material can also cover the reflecting layer or layers. The dielectric material used is then preferably inorganic and can be selected for example from the metal fluorides metal oxides metal sulphides metal nitrides metal carbides and combinations thereof. The dielectric material can be in the crystalline semicrystalline or amorphous state. The dielectric material in this configuration can for example be selected from the following materials MgF SiO SiO AlO TiO WO AlN BN BC WC TiC TiN NSi ZnS glass particles carbons of the diamond type and combinations thereof.

As a variant the diffracting pigment can be composed of a preformed dielectric or ceramic material such as a naturally lamellar mineral for example mica peroskovite or talc or synthetic lamellae formed from glass alumina SiO carbon an iron oxide mica mica covered with BN BC graphite bismuth oxychloride and combinations thereof.

Instead of a layer of a dielectric material other materials that improve the mechanical properties may be suitable. Such materials can comprise silicone metal silicides semiconducting materials formed from elements of groups III IV and V metals having a cubic body centred crystalline structure cermet compositions or materials semiconducting glasses and various combinations thereof.

The diffracting pigment used can notably be selected from those described in US patent application US 2003 0031870 published on 13 Feb. 2003.

A diffracting pigment can for example have the following structure MgF Al MgF a diffracting pigment having this structure being marketed under the designation SPECTRAFLAIR 1400 Pigment Silver by the company FLEX PRODUCTS or SPECTRAFLAIR 1400 Pigment Silver FG. The proportion by weight of MgFcan be between 80 and 95 of the total weight of the pigment.

The amount of diffracting pigment can vary by weight relative to the total weight of the first composition for example from 0.1 to 5 .

The size of the diffracting pigment can for example be between 5 and 200 m better still between 5 and 100 m for example between 5 and 30 m.

The thickness of the particles of diffracting pigment can be less than or equal to 3 m better still 2 m for example of the order of 1 m.

The composition according to the invention can include for example reflective particles notably of glitter among others magnetic or nonmagnetic.

 Reflective particles means in the sense of the present invention particles whose size structure notably the thickness of the layer or layers of which they are constituted and their physical and chemical natures and the surface condition enable them to reflect incident light. This reflection can if necessary be of sufficient intensity to create on the surface of the composition or of the mixture when the latter is applied on the substrate to be made up superglossy points that are visible to the naked eye i.e. points that are more luminous which contrast with their surroundings and appear to shine.

The reflective particles can be selected in such a way as not to alter significantly the colouring effect produced by the colorants with which they are combined and more particularly so as to optimize this effect in terms of colour rendition. They can more particularly possess a yellow pink red bronze orange brown gold and or copper colour or reflection.

The reflective particles can be present in the composition at a content in the range from 0.5 to 60 relative to the total weight of the composition notably from 1 to 30 wt. in particular from 3 to 10 wt. .

These particles can have a variety of shapes notably they can be in the form of small plates or can be globular in particular spherical.

The reflective particles regardless of their shape may or may not have a multilayer structure and in the case of a multilayer structure for example at least one layer of uniform thickness notably of a reflective material.

When the reflective particles do not have a multilayer structure they can be composed for example of metal oxides notably of oxides of titanium or of iron obtained by synthesis.

When the reflective particles have a multilayer structure the latter can for example comprise a natural or synthetic substrate notably a synthetic substrate at least partially coated with at least one layer of a reflective material notably of at least one metal or metallic material. The substrate can be of single material or multiple material organic and or inorganic.

More particularly it can be selected from glasses ceramics graphite metal oxides aluminas silicas silicates notably aluminosilicates and borosilicates synthetic mica and mixtures thereof this list not being exhaustive.

Formula B corresponds to a composition comprising D glucopyranoside D fructofuranosyl acetate 2 methyl propanoate which is a sucrose ester instead of the polyester.

Formula A is very glossy very slippery and comfortable during application and after application. It is soft and creamy. It does not leave a pulling sensation on the lips.

Formula B is glossy slows down slightly when applied is not slippery catches and is slightly sticky. After application pulling sensations are experienced on the lips.

Formula C corresponds to a composition according to the invention where the polyester used is the polymer marketed by Biosynthis under the designation Viscoplast 14436H INCI name dilinoleic acid butanediol copolymer .

Formula C is very pleasant during application slippery to just the right extent extremely soft and creamy. It gives a good thickness of the deposit it is glossy not very sticky the film obtained on the lips is quite thick and uniform and is effectively present on the lips.

Formula D is excessively slippery and excessively oily it migrates it shines and the colour is not very homogeneous after application.

Formula C exhibits a viscosity measured on a Rheomat viscometer with a 4 spindle of 32.2 DU deviation units .

Formula D exhibits a viscosity measured on a Rheomat viscometer with a 4 spindle of 24.4 DU deviation units .

Thus it is apparent that the polyester used according to the invention makes it possible to increase viscosity of formula C which comprises only 2 of silica relative to formula D which comprises 4 of silica.
