title: System and method for implementing workflow management using messaging
abstract: A system provides workflow management functions over a messaging or data protocol. A workflow management object defining functions and values and events for sending and receiving workflow management data is defined on a first device and transmitted to a second device. On the second device the workflow is rendered for interaction and response, and an interaction with the workflow object is captured. A captured or generated response is transmitted back to the first device or intermediary system via the messaging protocol. The response to the workflow object (e.g. an event) may be used by the device or intermediary systems to update a status of a workflow such as hosted by a remote server system. Events detected by a workflow system may invoke processing of subsequent workflow objects in a chain such that a complex workflow may be processed over the messaging protocol.

The present invention relates generally to workflow management tools. Workflow management or project management software enables users to specify tasks ordering of tasks define reminders for the completion of tasks and take other actions to record progress of a project and plan activities needed to complete a project. However these tools are desktop based and are ill suited for remote workers in the field and other distributed work forces.

The capabilities of mobile phones have increased significantly and many may have the capacity to operate task management tools but are unsuitable due to their small screen size and limited battery life. Mobile phones do advantageously enable rapid communication among remote workers by means of various OTT over the top data messaging services such as Skype messaging protocols such as XMPP and mobile messaging protocols and services such as short message service SMS multimedia message service MMS and enhanced message service EMS messaging. However the limited capabilities of the interfaces for these channels are not readily used for workflow management functions. Other messaging protocols exist for exchanging messages between desktop or laptop computers such as email and various instant messaging protocols. These likewise provided limited capacity for managing workflow management functions.

The systems and methods disclosed herein provide an improved approach for performing workflow management using messaging protocols for both mobile and other computing devices.

It will be readily understood that the components of the present invention as generally described and illustrated in the Figures herein could be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations. Thus the following more detailed description of the embodiments of the invention as represented in the Figures is not intended to limit the scope of the invention as claimed but is merely representative of certain examples of presently contemplated embodiments in accordance with the invention. The presently described embodiments will be best understood by reference to the drawings wherein like parts are designated by like numerals throughout.

The invention has been developed in response to the present state of the art and in particular in response to the problems and needs in the art that have not yet been fully solved by currently available apparatus and methods.

A workflow is just a repeatable sequence of ordered operations resulting in some coordinated activity of services information materials and people. Workflow is in conflict to some extent with language itself it is the nature of verbal and text communication in spoken languages that most statements made by any two different people will not be repeatable and exact or be able to be interpreted in a singular manner. Workflow needs to be repeatable and so we need to step beyond language as the medium by which workflow is delivered.

A workflow as contemplated in this application may be similar to and an element of business process management representing the processes of an enterprise so that the current process may be analyzed and improved. Flow charts have existed since the early 1900 s and data flow diagrams are over 40 years old. The systems and methods disclosed herein provide an approach to performing a workflow in the course of a social and communications context. Workflows and processes can be shared managed used and modified by those that are related by social connection and in the course of communications whether professional or personal.

The advantages of the disclosed approach are multiple. For example sharing of a workflow can imply assigning that workflow to a person engaging that workflow from or for a person or adding the person to a list of those contributing to the outputs of the workflow result. In other words the communications of the workflow itself is a defining characteristic which changes the resulting activities of the workflow.

Additionally there is not current use of an approach wherein the communications of the workflow are viewed as a type of communication to the same extent as a picture document or audio or video media communication. Workflows in prior approaches are static processes which may be used for sending data from one process step to the next and the element of connection of the workflow as a social interaction and form of communication is novel.

The systems and methods disclosed herein provide a means of communication that encompasses multiple types of data maps time data participants etc. and packages them together into a form where it can be interacted with by a remote party as part of a communication channel.

To add the needed level of precision to text communications for repeatable workflows the systems and methods disclosed herein facilitate interaction over a text voice or data channel that results in the ability of a group or individual to provide precisely specified operations or options to another party and for the other party to precisely select one of the provided options. This capability is implemented using a workflow object or a workflow widget . A workflow widget is a way to embed a precisely defined activity or workflow into a text or multimedia message stream such that one can obtain a precise or desired response based on selecting a provided workflow option. The method of selection in a mobile or pc environment may be via gesture touch mouse click or typing. The precise response is obtained by the selection of an available option that is precisely defined. The form of the list may vary by design in terms of providing a list of options following standard User Interface UI practices options lists buttons icons text supporting metadata describing the message contents people involved and possible actions on the workflow such as accepting an option requesting additional options or rejecting the available options.

Embodiments in accordance with the present invention may be embodied as an apparatus method or computer program product. Accordingly the present invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment an entirely software embodiment including firmware resident software micro code etc. or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may all generally be referred to herein as a module or system. Furthermore the present invention may take the form of a computer program product embodied in any tangible medium of expression having computer usable program code embodied in the medium.

Any combination of one or more computer usable or computer readable media may be utilized. For example a computer readable medium may include one or more of a portable computer diskette a hard disk a random access memory RAM device a read only memory ROM device an erasable programmable read only memory EPROM or Flash memory device a portable compact disc read only memory CDROM an optical storage device and a magnetic storage device. In selected embodiments a computer readable medium may comprise any non transitory medium that can contain store communicate propagate or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system apparatus or device.

Computer program code for carrying out operations of the present invention may be written in any combination of one or more programming languages including an object oriented programming language such as Java Smalltalk C or the like and conventional procedural programming languages such as the C programming language or similar programming languages. Computer program code may also be written in a functional language such as Erlang. The program code may execute entirely on a computer system as a stand alone software package on a stand alone hardware unit partly on a remote computer spaced some distance from the computer or entirely on a remote computer or server. In the latter scenario the remote computer may be connected to the computer through any type of network including a local area network LAN or a wide area network WAN or the connection may be made to an external computer for example through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider .

The present invention is described below with reference to flowchart illustrations and or block diagrams of methods apparatus systems and computer program products according to embodiments of the invention. It will be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations and or block diagrams and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and or block diagrams can be implemented by computer program instructions or code. These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer special purpose computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine such that the instructions which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus create means for implementing the functions acts specified in the flowchart and or block diagram block or blocks.

These computer program instructions may also be stored in a non transitory computer readable medium that can direct a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to function in a particular manner such that the instructions stored in the computer readable medium produce an article of manufacture including instruction means which implement the function act specified in the flowchart and or block diagram block or blocks.

The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer or other programmable apparatus to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide processes for implementing the functions acts specified in the flowchart and or block diagram block or blocks.

Referring to the systems and methods disclosed herein may be implemented using the illustrated network environment . A server system may access a workflow database storing data for a project and used by a workflow management tool executed by the server system . The server system may include one or more processors and one or more separate computing devices that may be co located or remote from one another.

The workflow management tool may implement any of the functionality of a workflow management or project management tool known in the art. For example the workflow management tool may receive and store a list of a tasks and due dates for tasks as well as provide reminders for when tasks should be completed based on due dates. The workflow management tool may receive and store assignments of tasks to individuals or groups of individuals. The workflow management tool may receive and store a sequence of tasks such that when one task is recorded as complete the workflow management tool generates a notification to perform the next task in the sequence. The workflow management may provide an interface for users to update the statuses of tasks as well as provide information regarding the completion of tasks. Other workflow management and project management functions may also be implemented by the workflow management tool as known in the art.

Workflow objects may be generated by the server system workstations or on the devices themselves. For purposes of illustration the methods described herein are explained with reference to devices which are illustrated as mobile devices. However the illustrated methods may be performed between devices embodied as laptop or desktop computers or server computers providing an interface to one or more local or remote terminals. A device may be used to define a workflow object and store it in the memory of the device . The workflow object may be transmitted to another device in a message . The device may then store the message in its memory and process the workflow. The message may be a message according to any data transmission protocol such as IP internet protocol or some other messaging protocol SMS MMS EMS OTT data voice video document exchange cellular data transfer protocol or some other form of communication and may include or reference a workflow object defined and processed according to the methods described below. In particular workflow objects may be shared over a channel on top of any of these protocols or other data channel e.g. an over the top OTT channel. The systems and methods described herein advantageously enable implementing one or more workflow functions in a structured e.g. sequential fashion over a peer to peer connection between two devices which can then be used to influence or update a state of a workflow management tool.

The server system workstations and mobile devices may communicate with one another over a network such as the Internet local area network LAN wide area network WAN or any other network topology. Communication may be over any wired or wireless connection. In particular at least a portion of the path between mobile devices and the server may be a cellular wireless network.

Bus represents one or more of several types of bus structures such as a system bus PCI bus IEEE 1394 bus USB bus and so forth.

For purposes of illustration programs and other executable program components are shown herein as discrete blocks although it is understood that such programs and components may reside at various times in different storage components of computing device and are executed by processor s . Alternatively the systems and procedures described herein can be implemented in hardware or a combination of hardware software and or firmware. For example one or more application specific integrated circuits ASICs can be programmed to carry out one or more of the systems and procedures described herein.

A workflow object also referred to herein as widget definition may be an object definition that defines one or more data values and functions. The data values and functions of the workflow object may be those required to implement a workflow management function. For example a workflow objects may be defined that include functions and values for implementing one or more of 

A workflow object as created at step may be general. That is the workflow object may include functions and methods for performing one of the operations listed above but not yet populated with specific values for a specific situation in which the operation is performed. For example a workflow object definition for providing a list of appointments 3 may include functions and methods for providing the list but not include an actual list of appointments and parameters for each appointment when created at step .

Creating a workflow object at step may further include providing such data as metadata for the object defining elements needed to implement the functions of the workflow object providing authentication tokens used to verify the authenticity of the workflow object providing lookups for data needed to implement the functionality of the workflow object and providing functions for viewing or otherwise accessing the data of the workflow object. Examples of elements of a workflow object are discussed in greater detail below.

The method may further include at step performing some or all of discovering activating and enabling a workflow object definition. In some embodiments in order for a workflow object to be used according to the methods described herein it may made available to individuals and groups using the workflow management tool or otherwise using the functionality of workflow objects as described herein. Accordingly mobile devices and or workstations generating and using workflow objects as defined herein may search or query a published directory in order to access workflow objects as created at step . In some embodiments only those workflow objects that have been activated and enabled for use may be used by a device or workstation to create instances of workflow objects as described herein.

Steps may be implemented on the server system on a workstation or on a workstation interfacing with the server system . In particular workflow objects as created according to steps may be stored in the workflow object database .

The method may further include selecting a workflow object definition. Step may be performed on a sending device by a user. An interface may be presented on the sending device and provide a list of available workflow objects. The interface may be an interface native to an operating system on the sending device a web interface or some other interface. The list may further include a textual description of a workflow object definition. A user may then select an item from the list in order to generate an instance of the selected workflow object definition.

The method may further include configuring an instance of the selected workflow object. As noted above each workflow object definition may have a functionality associated therewith. Configuring the instance of the selected workflow object definition may include providing specific data with respect to which the workflow object instance will perform that functionality. Configuration might be per field or be provided as a blob of JSON JavaScript Object Notation or unstructured data on a per workflow object basis. Configuration may further be performed by means of APACHE AVRO protocol buffers or similar data serialization system.

For example configuring the instance may include performing a look up of data for a specific element of the workflow object definition. In some embodiments a constructor or initiator function may be associated with the workplace object. For example a workflow object definition may define a function to be executed upon the occurrence of an onConfiguration event e.g. upon performing the configuring step . Accordingly this onConfiguration data may be processed in order to look up data request data from a user or otherwise configure the workflow object instance to perform its intended functionality.

Configuring the instance may further include specifying one or more recipients for the instance a start time for an event or tasks associated with the instance and an end time for the event or task associated with the instance. In some embodiments recipients to the workflow object instance may be determined automatically based on a conversational context in which configuration occurs. For example if a workflow object instance is created as part of conversation the recipients for the workflow object may be implicitly be determined to be other participants of the conversation.

Configuring the instance may further include specifying whether the instance will offer a recipient options of replying yes no remind me later or providing some other response upon receipt of the instance of the workflow object definition.

Configuring the instance may further include specifying a location of an event referenced by or represented by the instance. Configuration may further include specifying a time or date for the event referenced by or represented by the instance.

After receiving inputs for some or all of the values for the configuration step the data options and values for the instance of the workflow object definition may then be finalized.

In some embodiments the instance may be encrypted prior to transmission to a recipient. The encryption scheme may be any encryption scheme known in the art. In some embodiments for each instance of a workflow object definition a transaction identifier may be generated in order to uniquely identify that instance. In order to ensure global uniqueness the identifier may be obtained from the server system or otherwise coordinate with the server system to ensure uniqueness.

After processing according to some or all of steps the instance of the workflow object definition may then be transmitted to a recipient. The instance may be transmitted by the mobile device performing steps in a mobile message formatted and transmitted according to a mobile messaging protocol. For example the workflow object instance may be transmitted by means of XMPP extensible messaging and presence protocol SMS IP internet protocol REST API representational state transfer application programming interface a data channel or some other means. The protocol used may be a binary or test based protocol.

In some embodiments transmitting the instance may include transmitting a reference to the instance e.g. URL or some other reference such that the recipient may access the instance. In such embodiments the instance may be transmitted to the server system for storage and retrieval or may be generated and stored by the server system based on configuration values and choices transmitted to the server system by the sending device

Referring to upon receipt a recipient device may perform the illustrated method . For example the method may include decrypting the workflow object instance. The decrypting step may be according to any method known in the art. In particular encryption and decryption of the workflow object may be performed using a private key public key encryption decryption method. A representation of the workflow object instance may be displayed on the recipient mobile device. For example one or more data values stored in the workflow object instance may be displayed and one or more user interface elements defined by the workflow object instance or for modifying values of the workflow object instance may be displayed. In some embodiments the recipient device may validate the sender of the workflow object before processing the workflow object.

The method may further include receiving interaction with the representation of the workflow object. For example a workflow object may include the ability for the recipient to specify yes no and or remind me later to a workflow object instance. Accordingly the method may include receiving one or more of these responses. In some embodiments a software module for interfacing with the workflow object instance may be executed on the recipient device in order to both render a representation of the workflow object instance and receive interactions with the representation. Interactions with the representation of the workflow object instance may be received and a response generated that includes an indication of the response received e.g. selection of an option in a list specifying of yes no remind me later input of text data or some other input or action received on the recipient device

In some embodiments a workflow object instance may be represented initially as an icon text link or some other element. A user may then interact with this initial representation by clicking swiping tapping mouse down event mouse up event or some other gesture in order to invoke an interface for responding to the workflow object instance. In some embodiment user interaction may be a keyboard event such as input of a number or text character according to a text message protocol for handling non gesture forms of interaction.

Workflow responses may be processed via systems which do not support visual interfaces and which can accept criteria via a purely text based response system for example by accepting audio command and converting it to text. General commands may be defined textually such as with some prefix to indicate that text is a command e.g. a command or similar namespace may be defined for each individual or set of workflow objects. The basic set of commands may enable acceptance of an option from a list responding yes to a request responding no to a request asking for a summary asking for detail adding to a calendar or some other response.

In some embodiments a recipient device may reply by text or initiate some other response to the sending device after receiving a workflow object but that is not a response to the workflow object received.

Referring to upon receiving interaction with a representation of the workflow object instance on the recipient device the illustrated method may be used to respond to the device or user that transmitted the workflow object instance.

For example the response generated at step may be encrypted and returned to the sending user or mobile device. Returning the response may be according to any of the mobile messaging protocols described herein and may be the same as the mobile messaging protocol over which the workflow object instance was received by the recipient device . Upon receipt the sending device may decrypt the response and may transmit acknowledgment of receipt to the recipient device . Acknowledging receipt of the workflow object may be performed using a pre defined response code sent over a network such as a mobile network. Optionally on receipt of the response by an intermediary such as the server system the intermediary will acknowledge the receipt of the response back to the sending device depending on the medium of transport. Optionally the workflow object on receipt will send a notification to a secondary service regarding the change of workflow resulting from the response. This will depend on the workflow rules defined for that workflow for that group or business. In some embodiments the recipient device may further receive an instruction to share the workflow object and in response share the workflow object with another device or user. In the case of a workflow object implementing a scheduling request the effect of sharing the object may be to add the recipients with whom it is shared as participants in the meeting as recorded by the workflow object or in a database associated with the workflow management tool. For example the workflow management system may add an event defined by the scheduling request to calendars of the participants.

Upon receiving the response the workflow object instance as defined on the sending mobile device may invoke functionality associated with receipt of a response. Once a response has been made then it is an attribute of the workflow object and may indicate whether the transaction represented by the workflow object should be altered or voided subject to a timeout value or expiration date or whether a new transaction is required. For example a financial transaction will not be changeable after a given amount of time for example after it has been cleared.

For example a function of the workflow object instance may be associated with an onResponse event. Accordingly upon receiving the response from the recipient device the sending device may invoke the function associated with the onResponse event. In some embodiments this may include sending an API instruction according to the content of the response. Specifically the response from the recipient mobile device may be used to call and API function to update a state of a workflow management tool. For example where the workflow object instance was a request for an appointment and the response was an acceptance of the appointment the API function call may transmit a request to the workflow management tool to make a record of the appointment and generate appropriate reminders or take other actions with respect to the appointment. Where the response is an update to the status of a task sending the API instruction may include sending an instruction to the workflow management tool to update the status of the task to the status indicated by the response from the recipient device . The workflow management tool may then execute the API instruction.

As described in greater detail below a workflow object instance e.g. current workflow object instance may invoke another workflow object instance e.g. subsequent workflow object instance in response to an event such as an onResponse event. Accordingly the method may further include processing the next workflow object instance or definition according to a workflow object chain including the current workflow object instance. As noted above various functionality of a workflow object instance may be implemented. Accordingly the steps of sending receiving responding receiving the response and sending an API instruction for a workflow object in the examples given above may proceed as outlined below.

In person scheduling may be performed using the methods disclosed herein to perform one or more of making a reservation or appointment scheduling an installation repair delivery or other on location service generating a reminder for a follow up activity for an in person meeting such as scheduling a conference call e.g. an audio or video call defined by some or all of a phone number participants time etc. .

The scheduling of in person activities according to the methods disclosed herein may proceed as follows 

The processing of phone calls such as routing of calls or the taking of actions based on a call e.g. escalation from text to audio and or video. In particular a workflow object instance as described herein may be used to some or all of start a text voice video or screen sharing session.

In some embodiments a server system may select a support area of interest and rout a text voice video or screen share session with an individual or group. For example routing may be performed as follows 

In some embodiments a server system and widgets as described herein may be used to facilitate handing of sensitive information such as health information account information account balances authentication information and the like. For example sensitive information may be handled as follows 

In some embodiments a server system and widgets as described herein may be used to facilitate providing of confirmations for one or more activities such as acknowledging receipt of payment making of appointments or returning a poll result. For example confirmations may be processed as follows 

In some embodiments a server system and widgets as described herein may be used to facilitate providing contact information and for placing calls using such information. For example contact information may be provided as follows 

In some embodiments a server system and widgets as described herein may be used to facilitate presenting of forms and lists for review or input of responses. For example the server system and widgets may be used to distribute and collect responses to a survey questionnaire poll punch list customer satisfaction CSAT rating and selection of parameters for a meeting times locations people classes items . A company directed may also be distributed by the server system and one or more widgets. For example forms and lists may be distributed as follows 

In some embodiments a server system and widgets as described herein may be used to facilitate delivering documents for review acceptance and or signing. For example a contract invoice estimate purchase order blueprint or some other document may be presented transmitted for review and acceptance using workflow objects as disclosed herein. For example documents may be delivered for review and acceptance thereof processed as follows 

The actions taken in the list above on the recipient device e.g. the presentation of an interface and or receiving information may be performed by processing the functions and data of a workflow object instance generating by the sending device . Likewise the requests for information sent by the sending device may be packaged in the workflow object instance.

Referring specifically to a widget chain may be configured as shown. At step a widget A is selected configured and transmitted by a sending device in the manner described above with respect to . At step widget A is received and responded to by a recipient device such as in the manner described with respect to . At step the response to widget A is received an acted upon as defined by widget A. At step widget A responds to the received response by configuring and transmitting widget B from sending device based on the response to widget A.

At step widget B is received and responded to by the recipient device . At step a response to widget B is transmitted form the recipient device to the sending device . Widget B process the response and invokes configuration and sending of widget C which is likewise received and responded to by the recipient device at step . The response to widget C is received and responded to by the sending mobile device at step such as by means of functions defined by widget C. If widget C is the last widget in the chain then the job commenced by widget A may be confirmed complete at step . In some embodiments the completion of processing of a last widget in a chain may generate an event indicating completion of the chain the event being different from or in addition to an event that may be triggered by the last widget itself completing.

Although the chain of is described as the exchange of widgets between a single sending device and a single recipient device other methods are also possible. For example widget A may go to a first recipient mobile device whereas widgets B and C are transmitted to a different recipient mobile device or B and C are each transmitted to different recipient mobile devices from each other and from widget A.

If element X and Y are found to be compatible then the connection between widget A and widget B through the output input relationship of elements X and Y is finalized e.g. stored in the widget instances A and B.

In some embodiments multiple elements of widget A may be coupled to more than one input element of one or more different widgets. For example element Z from widget A may be selected and connected to input element R of widget B or some other widget. If elements Z and R are validated at step then the connection may be finalized at step . If no more widgets are to be added then the widget chain may be stored transmitted or processed according to the methods described herein.

A chain may be continued to add one or more widgets as well. For example one or more output elements of widget B may be connected to one or more input elements of some other widget C in the same manner that outputs of widget A were connected to inputs of widget B. A chain of two three or any number N of widgets may be defined by connecting outputs of one widget to the inputs of another in the illustrated manner.

The configuration for widget A for all matching elements mapped at step may then be imported . Importing may include obtaining data objects defining the elements to be added to widget A from the server system or some other source and adding them to widget A.

Widget A may then be sent to party B. Upon receiving widget A on a recipient device an event may be called for widget A e.g. an onReceive onResponse or some other event triggered form interaction with a representation of widget A. In response an object may be generated that implements widget A such as a JSON JavaScript Object Notation XML extensible markup language or some other type of object. This object may then be sent to a REST API location specified by widget A. For example step may refer to taking the data format of the workflow object definition and serializing it to a datastore via an API. In other words saving the final data representation to a database. For example instead of the workflow object just existing as an internal data structure exchanged between devices a workflow object may created and shared according to the method described herein. The workflow object definition may be defined using an APACHE AVRO format or other DDL data description language and provided by a third party vendor by way of an entity operating a server system to perform the methods described herein. A workflow object definition can be serialized and transmitted to a sending device . The workflow object definition may the n be deserialized on the sending device and configured to generate a workflow object instance. For example a JSON description of the workflow object definition could result in a workflow object instance being defined and similarly the workflow object instance could be serialized back into another semi structured or unstructured communicable form for transmission via SOAP or REST API.

As shown in an interface may include a time indicating a time that a widget was received a sender field including an identifier of the sender of the widget one or more user interfaces for receiving inputs from the recipient e.g. the Y and N fields for accepting or rejecting . The interface may further include an event definition . For example where the widget is an invitation to join a meeting keep an appointment or perform some other tasks the event definition may define the time date location parties or other attribute of the meeting appointment or task. As noted above various elements may be associated with a widget such as a checklist map poll or any of the other possible elements described herein. Accordingly the event definition field may include a rendering representation or interface to one or more elements of a widget.

Referring to an interface displayed in response to receiving a response to a widget on a sending device may include a time at which the response was received an identifier for the sender an identifier of the responder a confirmation message or other information provided by the recipient for the widget and the event definition or other representation rendering or interface to the element or elements of the widget.

Referring to a widget instance may have some or all of the illustrated attributes. For example a widget instance may include a global unique identifier GUID . The GUID may be globally unique within some scope. For example among all widget definition generated by or for a company each may have a unique GUID. Where a server system provides services as disclosed herein for multiple entities the same set of identifiers may be used for each entity. Alternatively all widgets may be generated and used with respect to the server system may be unique regardless of entity.

A widget name may identify a widget definition or class of which widget instance is an instance or may be a title given to it by a user upon configuration in order to provide a human understandable label.

The widget instance GUID may uniquely identify a particular instance of a widget definition whereas GUID uniquely identifies a particular widget definition of which widget instances may be instantiated.

Widget provider GUID may uniquely identify a user who invoked creation of a widget definition or an instance of a widget definition. For example provider GUID may be a global identifier for a developer or entity that created a widget definition.

The encryption type indicates the type of encryption to be used in encrypting and decrypting the widget instance . Provider authentication API token may be used by a widget instance to perform authentication with the server system in order to issue API instructions to the workflow management tool.

Provider custom data may include one or more data values associated with a widget definition of which the widget is an instance. Accordingly the widget instance may include variables for these values and possibly values assigned to these values as the widget is configured and used according to the methods described herein.

Widget status may indicate the status of the widget instance in its life cycle. For example a widget may be configured but not sent sent but not responded to responded to or ended. A widget may be ended when functions associated there with have been performed and no further functions are to be performed. For example after a widget has been transmitted a response received and any corresponding actions to be taken based on that response have been performed the widget may finish execution and may be de instantiated i.e. garbage collected so that the memory occupied thereby may be reused. In some embodiments a widget instance may be set to expire at a certain time after it is created sent or received by a recipient device . Accordingly an expiration time may also be included in the data defining a widget instance .

In some embodiments recipient device may share a widget with one or more other mobile devices. In some embodiments a widget instance may have a parameter set to indicate whether or not sharing is permitted. If the parameter indicates that sharing is not permitted then sharing of the widget may be prevented such as by a software module rendering the widget refusing to present the option to share the widget or the widget itself lacking the functions to perform sharing. Otherwise if sharing is enabled interface elements and functions to enable sharing may be provided on the recipient device . In some embodiments a recipient of a shared widget may be able to view the widget but not modify the widget or provide a response thereto to the sending device . In some embodiments a parameter of a widget instance may permit a recipient of a shared widget to modify the widget or respond to it. For example if the workflow regards an internal meeting sending a widget to another recipient would imply adding the additional party to the workflow if it is a meeting or appointment request adding additional signers to a document or changing the owner of the workflow.

In some embodiments a widget instance may be editable by a user that created it or a recipient. Accordingly a parameter of a widget instance may specify whether the widget instance can be modified and by whom after the widget instance has been created and populated with data values.

A widget instance may have a widget element associated therewith either as part of the widget definition or associated therewith during configuration of the widget. An element may have some or all of the listed attributes associated therewith.

As noted above a widget instance may request or receive a response. Accordingly a widget instance may include functions and data specifying whether a response is requested or permitted and defining what response is requested is permitted e.g. the data type or interface by which the response is received.

For example a widget may have an element type that may correspond to one of the element types listed in or some other type. Element data may include that data which is sufficient to render the element functional. For example where the element is a map element data may include location data or actual cartographic information that is accessed using the map element.

An element template may define values and value types that may be specified by a user in order to create an instance of that element and perform the functions associated with the element. An element icon may define a graphical symbol used to represent the element in a graphical user interface GUI representation of the element in a widget.

A widget data lookup URI uniform resource identifier may specify a network accessible location for data used by the element . Considering again a map element the URI may be the location of cartographic data used to render a map or perform navigation functions.

A document sign element may be an object for storing a verifiable signature e.g. digital signature provided by a user in order to receive in a highly reliable manner a signature of a user and provide proof of that signature to some other function or computer system.

An element may include a custom element that defines functions and methods defined by an end user to meet a particular need. A select list may define an object with a number of data values and provide functions for displaying the data values receiving a selection of one of the data values and providing the selected data value to a calling function or computer system. A radio list may likewise be an object including a plurality of data values and providing functions for displaying the data values receiving a selection of one or more of the data values and providing the one or more selected data values to a calling function or computer system. A date list may likewise be an object including a plurality of dates and or times and providing functions for displaying the dates and or times receiving a selection of one or more of the dates and or times and providing the one or more selected dates and or times to a calling function or computer system.

A text entry element may be an object defining functions for receiving text displaying received text performing editing of received text and outputting text to a calling function or computer system.

An icon element may be an object including one or more icons and providing an interface for a user to select the one or more icons. For example an icon element may be an object including functions for displaying N icons and receiving a selection of M of the icons M 0 to N . The icon element may further provide the number of icons selected to a calling function or computer system. The icon element may therefore be used to receive a user rating of a product interaction or some other thing.

A signature sign off element may be an object including functions for displaying data such as the status of a task or project and for receiving in a highly reliable manner a user signature that authenticates the user and reliably indicates that the user has signed off with respect to the displayed data. The element may further provide an output to a calling function or computer system indicating that signing off with respect to the displayed data has or has not occurred.

A payment or financial transaction element may be an object including functions for some or all of receiving payment information receiving authorization for payment securely processing payment providing confirmation of payment or other functions associated with a financial transaction.

A conference call element may be an object including functions for some or all of adding participants to a list of participants sharing invitations to join a call initiating a call ending a call or performing other functions associated with a call.

The event model may include an onRequestAlternateURI event that enables a recipient or sender to request additional options e.g. if a sender configures a widget to provides options x y and z a recipient may respond to the widget by providing an additional options thereby triggering an onRequestAlternateURI event.

An onSelectURI event may occur when a selection is made such as of an option on a recipient device . The selection may then be transmitted to a destination specified by function defined for the onSelectURI event .

An onRejectURI event may occur when a rejection is received for a widget on a recipient device . In response a function associated with this event may then be invoked.

An onAccept event may occur when a recipient of a widget instance selects an interface element indicating acceptance. For example a widget may present interface elements indicating yes no and or remind me later. Accordingly the onAccept event may occur upon a user selecting the yes interface element. A corresponding onReject event may be generated upon a recipient indicating rejection to the widget instance.

An onConfiguration element may occur when a user configures a widget according to the methods described herein i.e. specifies configuration values for a widget definition when creating a widget instance.

An onSend event may occur when a widget instance is transmitted to a recipient device . An onReceive event may occur when a widget instance is received by a recipient device . The onReceive event may occur on the sending device as well e.g. upon receiving acknowledgement of receipt of the widget.

An onShare event may occur upon a recipient of a widget attempting to transmit the widget to one or more other users or otherwise making the widget accessible to other users. A Text Entry event may occur upon a user typing or otherwise inputting text into a text entry field defined by a widget. In some embodiments an onResponse event may be generated on the recipient device upon a user entering a response to a widget received on the recipient device . An onReceiveResponse may occur when the sending device receives a response to a widget transmitted from the sending device
