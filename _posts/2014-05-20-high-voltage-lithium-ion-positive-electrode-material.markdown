This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 911 700 filed on 4 Dec. 2013 the complete disclosures of which in their entirety are herein incorporated by reference.

The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The present invention relates in general to a positive electrode material and in particular to a high voltage lithium ion positive electrode material.

LiFePOis a Li ion positive electrode material that has been favored for its strong abuse tolerance which in turn has been attributed to the nature of the oxygen bonding in the phosphate group. Also it is desirable to harness the abuse tolerance of a phosphate based cathode in a material that stores more energy. One possibility is to look to higher voltage olivines such as LiMnPO4.1 V LiCoPO4.8 V or LiNiPO5.1V since the stored energy is proportional to the voltage. LiCoPOin particular has the potential to increase energy 40 compared to LiFePO. Furthermore its electronic structure is more favorable than LiMnPOand LiNiPOin terms of polaronic conductivity and ability to form polarons respectively.

However and even though initial research on LiCoPOled to improvements in the rate of discharge capacity fade has blocked further progress. As such an improved Li ion positive electrode material with a high discharge capacity and low capacity fade would be desirable.

A Li ion positive electrode material is provided. The material has a nominal stoichiometry of LiCoSiFeMM PO where M is a trivalent cation such as Cr Ti Al Mn Ni V Sc La and or Ga M is a divalent cation such as Mn Ni Zn Sr Cu Ca and or Mg y is within a range of 0

In some instances the positive electrode material has a composition where y is within the range of 0.02 y 0.08 x is within the range of 0.05 x 0.15 and M Cr or Ti. In other instances y is within the range of 0.04 y 0.06 x is within the range of 0.08 x 0.12 and M Cr or Ti. In still other instances y 0.05 x 0.10 and M Cr or Ti.

In one embodiment z and d are equal to zero and the Li ion positive electrode material has a nominal stoichiometry of LiCoFeCr PO an initial capacity of at least 125 mAh g and a discharge capacity of at least 105 mAh g after 500 cycles.

In another embodiment d is equal to zero z is not equal to zero the positive electrode material contains Si and the Li ion positive electrode material has a nominal stoichiometry of LiCoSiFeM PO where x and y have the values given above and z is within a range of 0

An improved Li ion positive electrode material with an initial capacity of at least 120 mAh g and a discharge capacity of at least 100 mAh g after 500 cycles is provided. In some instances the improved Li ion positive electrode material has initial capacity of at least 125 mAh g and a discharge capacity of at least 105 mAh g after 500 cycles. In addition the material can contain Si which provides an coulombic efficiency to between 97 100 at a C 3 cycle rate.

It is appreciated that the improved capacity and dramatically reduced capacity fade is striking relative to LiCoPO. The use of a double compositional modification increases the discharge capacity from 100 mAh g to about 130 mAh g in the most favorable cases for Ti and Fe or Cr and Fe modification of LiCoPO while retaining the discharge capacity retention of the singly Fe substituted LiCoPO. Additional compositional modification to include Si increases the cycle life and greatly improves the coulombic efficiency to between 97 100 at a C 3 cycle rate.

The material has a nominal stoichiometry of LiCoSiFeMM PO where M is a trivalent cation such as Cr Ti Al Ni V Sc La and or Ga M is a covalent cation such as Mn Ni Zn Sr Cu Ca and or Mg y is within a range of 0

The positive electrode material can also contain Si and the Li ion positive electrode material can have a nominal stoichiometry of LiCoSiFeM PO where x and y have the values given above and z is within a range of 0

In order to better teach the invention but not limit its scope in any way a solid state synthesis method for making the LiCoSiFeMM PO material and one or more examples of the inventive material are discussed below.

The resulting crystalline phase s were identified using X ray powder diffraction X ray data were collected using a Rigaku Ultima III diffractometer Lattice constants were calculated from peak positions using Rietveld refinement of the pattern collected in a parallel beam geometry. For electrochemical testing a composite electrode was fabricated by a slurry coating method. Using N methylpyrrolidone NMP as solvent a slurry was used to coat an Al foil substrate to produce a composite electrode of ca. 80 wt. active material 10 wt. polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF 8 wt. super P carbon and 2 wt. conductive carbon nanotube composite CheapTubes.com . The electrode film was cut into small discs with an area of 0.97 cmand dried under an infrared lamp in air before use. In a dry room Dew point 

Substitution of elements in addition to Fe for Co including Cr Ti Al and Ga increased the discharge capacity of Fe substituted LiCoPOwhile maintaining long cycle life. Not being bound by theory a nominal stoichiometry LiCoFeM PO M Cr Ti Al and or Ga that favors substitution on the Co site and cation vacancies exhibited favorable performance since substitution on the Li site blocks Li ion conduction. In addition the above stoichiometry favors the presence of cation vacancies that might enhance Li ion conductivity.

Turning now to capacity as a function of cycle for a number of different compositions are shown. The Ti Fe and Cr Fe double modifications exhibited the most favorable discharge capacity and cycle life. Furthermore a composition level was discovered to be 0.10 for Fe and 0.05 for Ti or Cr. All samples exhibited superior cycle life compared to LiCoPOand increased discharge capacity relative to singly Fe substituted LiCoPO labeled 20Fe ARL in the figure and corresponds to nominal stoichiometry of LiCoFePO .

As shown in the un substituted LiCoPOcontrol sample exhibited severe capacity fade. However the Fe substitution into LiCoPO nominal LiCoFePO had a significant reduction in capacity fade relative to the un substituted LiCoPO. Also increasing the discharge capacity by further composition modification with another element in addition to Fe is shown. For example the LiCoFeCr PO sample showed better capacity retention with cycling despite having a slightly smaller initial discharge capacity than LiCoFeTi PO .

Not being bound by theory improved discharge electrochemical performance may likely result from increased electronic and or ionic conductivity. The Li ion conductivity is of course a function of the Li ion concentration and the Li ion mobility. Since there is little difference in the Li ion concentration between the modified LiCoPOand the unmodified LiCoPO the increased Li ion mobility is a likely hypothesis for the improvement in discharge capacity and rate capability rate shown in of Cr Fe substituted LiCoPOrelative to LiCoPO.

When a higher Cr content was prepared LiCoFeCr PO the XRD pattern showed an extra peak around 25 degrees two theta which matches LiCrPO. This is in agreement with the electrochemical results which showed an optimal level of 0.05 Cr since at a higher Cr content a non electrochemically active second phase LiCrPO appears.

The presence of the secondary LiTi PO like phase suggests that the mechanism to increase the electrochemical performance of Ti Fe substituted LiCoPOmay differ from that of the Cr Fe substituted LiCoPO. As previously discussed at a 0.05 Cr substitution level a bulk substitution for Co is obtained. In contrast the Ti Fe modified LiCoPOsamples all contain a small fraction of a LiTi PO like phase and we therefore suggest that the improvement in electrochemical performance for Ti Fe modified LiCoPOmay result from the beneficial effect this phase has on the Li ion conductivity of the substituted LiCoPO.

The LiTi PO like phase has the NASICON structure and it is known to be an excellent Li ion conductor as a result of the structural characteristics of the NASICON structure which favor high Li ionic conductivity. Furthermore the interface of two Li ion conducting materials can lead to orders of magnitude increased Li ion conductivity on both sides of the interface through a synergistic effect.

Having shown the improvements in capacity fade because of double compositional modifications of LiCoPO the favorable effects of composition modification on the capacity of LiCoFeCr PO as a function of rate are shown in . Typical discharge curves at three rates C 10 C 2 and C are plotted. The capacity at C 10 is about 132 mAh g. At a 1C rate the capacity is about 126 mAh g thus the material shows an excellent rate capability. The improvements are suggested to result from enhanced Li ion conduction.

In addition to the above the coulombic efficiency of the nominal composition of LiCoSiFeM PO with M Cr or Ti was improved by adding Si. The discharge capacity as a function of cycle and cycle life is shown in for LiCoSiFeCr PO relative to its Si free analog. As shown in the figure a significant improvement in the coulombic efficiency and cycle life was observed. LiCoSiFeTi PO showed a similar improvement in coulombic efficiency and an even greater improvement in cycle life as shown in .

The x ray diffraction pattern of the nominal composition LiCoSiFeCr PO is shown in . There is a peak around 25 degrees which does not correspond to the phospho olivine structure. This might either be Si related or LiCrPOas previously discussed. The lattice constants see Table 1 show a decrease in the unit cell volume relative to LiFeCoPO but the unit cell volume is larger than LiCoFeCr PO and suggests that inclusion of Si in the starting composition reduces the amount of Cr that can be substituted into LiCoPO. However the reduced unit cell volume relative to LiFeCoPOindicates that some substitution on the Co lattice site is still occurring. From a crystal chemistry perspective Cr effective radius 0.615 13 is more likely to substitute for Co effective ionic radius of 0.745 13 than Si effective ionic radius of 0.40 13 . The x ray diffraction pattern of nominal composition LiCoSiFeTi PO is shown in . There is a peak around 24.6 degrees two theta which does not correspond to the phospho olivine structure. This peak might be attributed to a LiSiO but a definitive assignment was not made since only 1 peak is evident and it falls within the same region as the LiTi PO like phase discussed earlier for Ti containing samples. The unit cell volume Table 1 for this sample was found to be 284.41 indicating no change from the Si free analog within the uncertainty of the measurement.

Changes and modifications to the teachings disclosed herein will be obvious to those skilled in the art and yet fall within the scope of the present invention. As such the scope of the invention is defined by the claims and all equivalents thereof.
