title: Search ranking diversity based on aspect affinity
abstract: Collaborative filtering along the aspect dimension and use of co-occurring aspects to qualify products that will be shown on a search page in response to unspecific user searches, such that diversity in the aspect value will add to the diversity of the search results and the collaborative nature of the aspects will induce diversity, is disclosed. A method and system for Search Ranking Diversity Based on Aspect Affinity includes collecting user search queries, parsing the collected user search queries for aspect phrases, identifying aspect metadata for the aspect phrases, creating a ranked index list of aspects from the aspect metadata, assigning weights to the ranked index list of aspects, receiving a user query and associating the received query with the ranked index list of aspects to produce ranked search results, and re-ranking the search results using diversified aspects from the ranked index list of aspects to produce user search results.

The present application relates generally to the technical field of commercial uses of search algorithms implemented on a computer and in one example embodiment to methods and systems to enable navigation of data items based on aspect affinity.

A user searching an information resource e.g. database may encounter challenges. One such challenge may be that a search mechanism e.g. a search engine that is utilized to search the information resource may return search results that are of little interest to the user. For example the search mechanism may respond to a query from the user with search results containing data items that lack relevance or diversity. This is particularly challenging for generic queries where a user has not specified what aspect of the product they are interested in. Due to the lack of catalogs when searching and or purchasing on line if relevance is overemphasized most products returned by a generic search look the same or similar on the first page with comparable prices. Sellers crowding the shelves complicate this problem. Efforts to diversify results often fail because they are not of interest to the buyer. Since search engines are not conversational the best outcome contemporary search engines can produce are results that make the user take the next action rather than leave the site. Unfortunately this approach does not capture user intent i.e. the intent of users when they type in a general query. Thus there is a need for qualifying products that will be shown on the search page such that diversity in the aspect value will add to the diversity of the search results and the collaborative nature of the aspects will induce diversity.

The word exemplary is used herein to mean serving as an example instance or illustration. Any embodiment described herein as exemplary is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments.

Example methods and systems for Search Ranking Diversity Based On Aspect Affinity are described. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of example embodiments. It will be evident however to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details.

Today search engines that search information resources to display commercial products only show product diversity based on the supply side without taking into account user preferences at the aspect level. In other words generic searching is not adequately based on an aspect of a product such as brand preference material size color or other feature on which the buyer will actually base a decision to purchase a particular item. For example a supply side driven search engine now returns 1.25 million matching results in response to a query for athletic shoes showing results for the three highest selling brands of athletic shoes. However a shopper is unlikely to actually purchase a leading brand of women s athletic shoes in the same transaction as men s athletic shoes. Even if with personalization the system knows that the user querying the system is a male the diversity of products are still supply based.

Conversely if a search system could identify the most important aspect of the products that are queried and use co occurrences between the values of the important unspecified aspect s both diversity and relevance are reflected by the search results. Only those products having aspects that are important to the buyer are presented while irrelevant results are suppressed. Han aspect value is specified in the query the same index can be used to expand recall by bringing in products that have a collaborative aspect value similar to merchandizing. In some embodiments detailed below by taking advantage of an understanding of a neighborhood of queries based upon aspects that are most commonly used with the query a shopper can be presented with both a relevant and diverse set of results. Other benefits of the embodiments of the present invention will be readily apparent from the description of the figures that follow.

In an example embodiment the merchant can operate computer systems such as an inventory system or a Point of Sale POS system . The network based publication system can interact with any of the systems used by merchant for operation of the merchant s retail or service business. In an example the network based publication system can work with both POS system and inventory system to obtain access to inventory available at individual retail locations operated by the merchant. This inventory information can be used in both generating product or service listings and selecting and ordering search results served by the network based publication system . An example network based publication system is detailed below in .

An Application Programming Interface API server and a web server are coupled to and provide programmatic and web interfaces respectively to one or more application servers . The application servers host one or more marketplace application modules in certain examples these can also include commerce modules advertising modules and marketplace modules to name a few payment modules dynamic offer modules search engine index modules communication modules and Aspect Extractor modules . The application servers are in turn shown to be coupled to one or more database servers that facilitate access to one or more databases . In some examples the application server can access the databases directly without the need for a database server .

The publication modules may provide a number of publication and search functions and services to users that access the networked system . The payment modules may likewise provide a number of payment services and functions to users. The payment modules may allow users to accumulate value e.g. in a commercial currency such as the U.S. dollar or a proprietary currency such as points in accounts and then later to redeem the accumulated value for products e.g. goods or services that are advertised or made available via the various publication modules within retail locations or within external online retail venues. The payment modules may also be configured to present or facilitate a redemption of offers generated by the dynamic offer modules to a user during checkout or prior to checkout while the user is still actively shopping . The offer modules may provide dynamic context sensitive offers e.g. coupons or immediate discount deals on targeted products or services to users of the networked system . The offer modules can be configured to use all of the various communication mechanisms provided by the networked system to present over options to users. The offer options can be personalized based on current location time of day user profile data past purchase history or recent physical or online behaviors recorded by the network based system among other things e.g. context information . While the publication modules payment modules and offer modules are shown in to all form part of the networked system it will be appreciated that in alternative embodiments the payment modules may form part of a payment service that is separate and distinct from the networked system . Additionally in some examples the offer modules may be part of the payment service or may form an offer generation service separate and distinct from the networked system .

Further while the system shown in employs a client server architecture the embodiments of the present invention are of course not limited to such an architecture and could equally well find application in a distributed or peer to peer architecture system for example. The various publication modules payment modules and offer modules could also be implemented as standalone systems or software programs which do not necessarily have networking capabilities.

The web client accesses the various publication modules payment modules and offer modules via the web interface supported by the web server . Similarly the programmatic client accesses the various services and functions provided by the publication modules payment modules and offer modules via the programmatic interface provided by the API server . The programmatic client may for example be a smartphone application that enables users to communicate search queries to the system while leveraging user profile data and current location information provided by the smartphone or accessed over the network . also illustrates a third party application executing on a third party server machine as having programmatic access to the networked system via the programmatic interface provided by the API server . For example the third party application may utilizing information retrieved from the networked system support one or more features or functions on a website hosted by the third party. The third party website may for example provide one or more promotional marketplace or payment functions that are supported by the relevant applications of the networked system . Additionally the third party website may provide merchants with access to the offer modules for configuration purposes. In certain examples merchants can use programmatic interfaces provided by the API server to develop and implement rules based pricing schemes that can be implemented via the publication modules payment modules and offer modules .

A challenge in reducing friction in search i.e. understanding what the user actually wants and showing what is wanted to finalize a purchase is solving the diversity problem. This is particularly important when the user query is not specific. For instance a user entering hand bag may not be clear as to what they are actually looking for in order to finalize a purchase. Since search engines are not conversational the best outcome for traditional search engines can is to show results that makes the user take the next action rather than leave the site. Currently attempts to mitigate this problem comprise showing aspect value sets alongside search results. For example a sidebar that will narrow the search results if a user checks a box for color size brand material or other feature of a generically entered product term without enough specificity to provide both relevance and diversity of search results may be shown. Another traditional method shows an even selection of products based upon a diverse selection of products created by distribution of the qualifying results across different categories or a variation based upon a combination of distribution of aspects distribution of sellers or distribution of formats of products qualifying for the search. Unfortunately none of these approaches capture user intent or the intent of users when entering a general product search query. The Search Ranking Diversity Based on Aspect Affinity methodology addresses these challenges as detailed below in .

For an example query hand bag the most commonly occurring queries that contain the phrase hand bag may be hand bag Gucci hand bag women s hand bag Louis Vuitton hand bag used and hand bag Coach in decreasing order of frequency. By analyzing all query phrases the Search Ranking Diversity Based on Aspect Affinity methodology can keep an index of a query with the query phrase type s . An exemplary reduced index of this list would be hand bag this covers Gucci Louis Vuitton Coach and or hand bag this covers the women s query .

When a user enters the exemplary query hand bag the Search Ranking Diversity Based on Aspect Affinity methodology knows that brand is the most commonly occurring phrase associated with the query and it can be used to show a list of products from different hand bag brands. Further because Gucci Louis Vuitton and Coach are most common it may promote these at the higher ranks over other brand name designers. The Search Ranking Diversity Based on Aspect Affinity methodology may then determine that is the second most important aspect after brand incorporate brand into the search results and so on.

Additional specificity may be introduced. The Search Ranking Diversity Based on Aspect Affinity methodology may collect past information from all users who entered hand bag with another phrase in the query. This is particularly useful when showing search results for a user on whom there is no historic information. If there is some information on the user the Search Ranking Diversity Based on Aspect Affinity methodology may use an index of queries for purchasers similar to this particular user. For example if the Search Ranking Diversity Based on Aspect Affinity methodology knows that the user is a woman it may then elect to use only information from other women users. Alternatively if the user is of gender man the Search Ranking Diversity Based on Aspect Affinity methodology may elect not to use any of the index information from women users. In a third embodiment the Search Ranking Diversity Based on Aspect Affinity methodology may use a history of past queries and product purchased by an individual user. For instance if the Search Ranking Diversity Based on Aspect Affinity methodology knows that the user has entered brands as the most common aspect associated with a core query phrase for this or other purchases the Search Ranking Diversity Based on Aspect Affinity methodology may determine that the user only purchases brand names and diversify the results based upon this aspect and show different or most often purchased brands of the product that qualify for the user query.

In operation Search Ranking Diversity Based on Aspect Affinity methodology collects all user search queries. Control flows to operation .

In operation collected user queries are parsed for aspect phrases. An aspect phrase may comprise a qualifier associated with an item. For an exemplary user search entry hand bag Coach a brand aspect may be parsed. Control flows to operation .

In operation metadata is identified for the aspect phrases. For example the user query hand bag coach metadata may be identified. Control flows to operation .

In operation a Ranked Index List of Aspects that are most common is created from the identified metadata. For an example user query hand bag Search Ranking Diversity Based on Aspect Affinity methodology may create an example a list of the form . Such an index may be created on a per user cluster basis to allow for better personalization or on a per user basis such that affinity to certain aspect may be retained. The index may be created on a per user basis or a per user per category basis or a per user per query basis. An index created on a per user basis may reflect information from past queries by the same user while an index created on a per cluster i.e. grouped according to a pre defined criteria basis may reflect information from a group of user queries or products. Likewise an index created on a per user per category basis may contain information from queries received from same user for a single category of items such as shoes or handbags. Control flow proceeds to operation .

In operation the Ranked Search results are re ranked using diversified Aspects from the Ranked Index List of Aspects to Produce User Search Results. For example when a user enters the exemplary generic query hand bag the Search Ranking Diversity Based on Aspect Affinity methodology uses the Ranked Index List of Aspects for collected information on the user query. Based upon the returned ranked list of aspects the Ranked Search Results are re ranked the using a diversified list of values. In an example embodiment a diversified list for the top k identified important aspects is used for re ranking. For simplicity k 1 in our example and the aspect is the brand aspect for the query hand bag . In other embodiments re ranking may be performed according to user and category basis described above.

In addition to user product searches other embodiments of Search Ranking Diversity Based on Aspect Affinity methodology may be used to diversify results in a recommender or merchandizing system where a user does not explicitly enter a query related to the results. In these embodiments improved ranking of search results and or more advantageous ordering of offerings in a recommender system or in a CRM marketing email system are realized.

For example when a user is viewing a specific product Panasonic 60 LED TV the Search Ranking Diversity Based on Aspect Affinity methodology may show television mounts. In another embodiment Search Ranking Diversity Based on Aspect Affinity methodology may use the term mounting rack as a query and show mounting racks of different brands.

As used herein the term memory refers to a machine readable medium able to store data temporarily or permanently and may be taken to include but not be limited to random access memory RAM read only memory ROM buffer memory flash memory and cache memory. While the machine readable medium is shown in an example embodiment to be a single medium the term machine readable medium should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media e.g. a centralized or distributed database or associated caches and servers able to store instructions. The term machine readable medium shall also be taken to include any medium or combination of multiple media that is capable of storing the instructions for execution by the machine such that the instructions when executed by one or more processors of the machine e.g. processor cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies described herein in whole or in part. Accordingly a machine readable medium refers to a single storage apparatus or device as well as cloud based storage systems or storage networks that include multiple storage apparatus or devices. The term machine readable medium shall accordingly be taken to include but not be limited to one or more tangible data repositories in the form of a solid state memory an optical medium a magnetic medium or any suitable combination thereof.

Throughout this specification plural instances may implement components operations or structures described as a single instance. Although individual operations of one or more methods are illustrated and described as separate operations one or more of the individual operations may be performed concurrently and nothing requires that the operations be performed in the order illustrated. Structures and functionality presented as separate components in example configurations may be implemented as a combined structure or component. Similarly structures and functionality presented as a single component may be implemented as separate components. These and other variations modifications additions and improvements fall within the scope of the subject matter herein.

Certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of components modules or mechanisms. Modules may constitute either software modules e.g. code embodied on a machine readable medium or in a transmission signal or hardware modules. A hardware module is a tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain physical manner. In various example embodiments one or more computer systems e.g. a standalone computer system a client computer system or a server computer system or one or more hardware modules of a computer system e.g. a processor or a group of processors may be configured by software e.g. an application or application portion as a hardware module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.

In some embodiments a hardware module may be implemented mechanically electronically or any suitable combination thereof. For example a hardware module may include dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured to perform certain operations. For example a hardware module may be a special purpose processor such as a field programmable gate array FPGA or an ASIC. A hardware module may also include programmable logic or circuitry that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. For example a hardware module may include software encompassed within a general purpose processor or other programmable processor. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry or in temporarily configured circuitry e.g. configured by software may be driven by cost and time considerations.

Accordingly the phrase hardware module should be understood to encompass a tangible entity be that an entity that is physically constructed permanently configured e.g. hardwired or temporarily configured e.g. programmed to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein. As used herein hardware implemented module refers to a hardware module. Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured e.g. programmed each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example where a hardware module comprises a general purpose processor configured by software to become a special purpose processor the general purpose processor may be configured as respectively different special purpose processors e.g. comprising different hardware modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor for example to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.

Hardware modules can provide information to send and receive information from other hardware modules. Accordingly the described hardware modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple hardware modules exist contemporaneously communications may be achieved through signal transmission e.g. over appropriate circuits and buses between or among two or more of the hardware modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times communications between such hardware modules may be achieved for example through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example one hardware module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then at a later time access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices and can operate on a resource e.g. a collection of information .

The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed at least partially by one or more processors that are temporarily configured e.g. by software or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured such processors may constitute processor implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions described herein. As used herein processor implemented module refers to a hardware module implemented using one or more processors.

Similarly the methods described herein may be at least partially processor implemented a processor being an example of hardware. For example at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or more processors or processor implemented modules. Moreover the one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a cloud computing environment or as a software as a service SaaS . For example at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers as examples of machines including processors with these operations being accessible via a network e.g. the Internet and via one or more appropriate interfaces e.g. an application program interface API .

The performance of certain operations may be distributed among the one or more processors not only residing within a single machine but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments the one or more processors or processor implemented modules may be located in a single geographic location e.g. within a home environment an office environment or a server farm in other example embodiments the one or more processors or processor implemented modules may be distributed across a number of geographic locations.

Some portions of the subject matter discussed herein may be presented in terms of algorithms or symbolic representations of operations on data stored as bits or binary digital signals within a machine memory e.g. a computer memory . Such algorithms or symbolic representations are examples of techniques used by those of ordinary skill in the data processing arts to convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. As used herein an algorithm is a self consistent sequence of operations or similar processing leading to a desired result. In this context algorithms and operations involve physical manipulation of physical quantities. Typically but not necessarily such quantities may take the form of electrical magnetic or optical signals capable of being stored accessed transferred combined compared or otherwise manipulated by a machine. It is convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to such signals using words such as data content bits values elements symbols characters terms numbers numerals or the like. These words however are merely convenient labels and are to be associated with appropriate physical quantities.

Unless specifically stated otherwise discussions herein using words such as processing computing calculating determining presenting displaying or the like may refer to actions or processes of a machine e.g. a computer that manipulates or transforms data represented as physical e.g. electronic magnetic or optical quantities within one or more memories e.g. volatile memory non volatile memory or any suitable combination thereof registers or other machine components that receive store transmit or display information. Furthermore unless specifically stated otherwise the terms a or an are herein used as is common in patent documents to include one or more than one instance. Finally as used herein the conjunction or refers to a non exclusive or unless specifically stated otherwise.

In one embodiment a method comprises collecting user search queries parsing the collected user search queries for aspect phrases identifying aspect metadata for the aspect phrases creating a ranked index list of aspects from the aspect metadata assigning weights to the ranked index list of aspects receiving a user query and associating the received query with the ranked index list of aspects to produce ranked search results and re ranking the search results using diversified aspects from the ranked index list of aspects to produce user search results.

In another embodiment a non transitory machine readable storage medium comprises instructions that when executed by one or more processors of a machine cause the machine to perform operations comprising collecting user search queries parsing the collected user search queries for aspect phrases identifying aspect metadata for the aspect phrases creating a ranked index list of aspects from the aspect metadata assigning weights to the ranked index list of aspects receiving a user query and associating the received query with the ranked index list of aspects to produce ranked search results and re ranking the search results using diversified aspects from the ranked index list of aspects to produce user search results.

In another embodiment a system for enabling navigation of a plurality of data items corresponding to a query comprises a communication module for receiving a user query a search index engine for collecting user search queries and an aspect extractor module for parsing collected user search queries for aspect phrases identifying aspect metadata for the aspect phrases creating a ranked index list of aspects from the aspect metadata assigning weights to the ranked index list of aspects associating the received query with the ranked index list of aspects to produce ranked search results and re ranking the search results using diversified aspects from the ranked index list of aspects to produce user search results.

In another embodiment re ranking the search results comprises using a diversified list of values for the most highly correlated k identified important aspects k being an integer.

In another embodiment a user does not explicitly enter a query related to the user search results into a recommender or marketing system.

Thus a method and system for Search Ranking Diversity Based on Aspect Affinity have been described. Although the present invention has been described with reference to specific example embodiments it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly the specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.
