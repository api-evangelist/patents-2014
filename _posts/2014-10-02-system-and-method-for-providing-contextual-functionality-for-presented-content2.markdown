In another embodiment a spring application allows for a search feature to provide a means for searching content of display device . For example the search may include a global search across all content or a context aware search within a current context.

Process may be initiated by a device e.g. device running an application by a device wherein the application is configured to present a user interface based on content displayed by a display device e.g. display device at block . According to one embodiment the application is a spring application configured to pair the device with the display device and to provide commands to the display device based on operation of a user interface presented on the device. Running the application includes executing the application to initiate pairing of the device with the display device. The application provides contextual functionality by tailoring functions of the application and presentation of graphical elements based at least in part on one or more of a particular content title and a type of media associated with the content title.

At block the device receives data from the display device wherein the data is associated with content displayed by the display device. Receiving data includes receiving metadata for active content presented by the display device.

At block a user interface is presented on the device by the application based on data received from the display device wherein graphical elements and functions of the user interface are presented based on content displayed by the display device and wherein graphical elements of the user interface are selectable to generate commands for the display device. Presenting the application includes presenting one or more graphical elements to provide quick access to playback of content on the display device. In one embodiment presentation of the application includes configuration of the user interface based on one or more contextual features associated with content presented by the display device wherein contextual information for content displayed by the display device is presented as information elements on the device by the application. According to another embodiment presentation of the application includes a presentation of a plurality of graphical elements that are selectable to initiate playback of a particular content title stored as a bookmark for the application.

Process may optionally include outputting a control command by the application for the display device to control operation of the display device wherein the control command is generated based on a detected user input to the application on the device at block . Process may also include storing at least one of image and media data by the application on the device wherein the at least one image and media data generated from content presented by the display device.

At block the application may be configured to load and or store one or more bookmarks or spring marks that the application may employ for accessing content.

Pair function includes detecting a user command to discover one or more display devices on the same local network the spring app displaying a list of discovered devices detecting a user selection of a display device to pair with the spring app prompting the user to enter an authentication and if the PIN is correct the display device adding the device. Multiple spring applications may be paired to a single display device.

Tag allows for marking media and may be associated with one or more tag functions . Tag function allows for one or more of creating and deleting springmarks tagging as favorite or watched to show hide content to block content and to rename input. Creating spring marks allows a user to create navigation macro shortcuts for an item. Springmarks may be useful to avoid multi step navigation of a user interface and can allow for taking users directly to a desired channel or content. Once created a springmark may be saved and available for selection on a launch pad. Deleting springmarks allows for users to delete springmarks no longer desired for the spring application. Tagging as favorite allows for items such as particular media titles or content to be marked by a user as favorite in order to quickly access content at a later time. Tagging as watched allows a viewer to quickly determine if content has already been viewed which can be helpful to determine the next episode to watch. A show hide content feature may be part of tag function to control what content appears as part of a collection. This feature may be useful for content that is not to be shared around an entire household. Blocking content allows for blocking access to certain items such as particular channels or applications. Renaming content allows for renaming content by displaying a keyboard text entry panel on a device e.g. device to provide text to a display device e.g. . Renaming input allows a similar approach to renaming an input to be descriptive to the device attached to it. Based on one or more tag functions the spring application can provide a publish content feature and or publish TV state . These features may allow for sharing content images or screen shots using a device separate from the display device.

Browse allows for marking media and may be associated with one or more tag functions . Browse functions allows for browsing spring application use history browsing active data and browsing a collection. The browsing spring history allows for a user to view previous spring contexts such as a list of the last number of items viewed or opened. Browse active content allows for a display device to send a spring app a notification that active content has changed in order to provide user information with active content. Browse collection allows for a user to view content associated with a collection and content within the collection.

Control allows for one or more of control functions . Control functions can include one or more of playback or playback collection enabling subtitles sharing data entry taking a screen shot deleting content uninstalling the spring app launching a spring mark and downloading content. A playback feature allows for playback controls to control active content on a display device from the spring app on a companion device.

A sharing feature of functions allows for sharing messages about content being viewed. Sharing may be associated with a feature function to compose messages take pictures and select pictures .

Data entry features provide a keyboard e.g. displayed graphical to allow for data entry to the display device. Take screen shot may allow for a user to capture a screenshot of the display device from a companion device. The captured data may be shared using social media email etc. A delete content feature allows for users to delete content stored by a media center of a display device. An uninstall app feature allows for users to uninstall applications downloaded from an app center using the spring application. A launch spring mark allows for detection of a user selection of a springmark and launching or navigating to media associated with the springmark. A download content feature allows for a user to download active content on a display device to a companion device.

View allows for users to view a current state of a display device. For example the spring app allows the user to view on a companion device which setting or location among inputs a display device is currently presenting. View functions can include functions for one or more of content information external content information media context and notifications. Content information functions may allow for the spring application to provide information related to active content without having to present guide or information on the display device e.g. TV . By way of example content information may include one or more of channel metadata event program metadata music album metadata music metadata image metadata photo album metadata video metadata device data and App metadata. A view external content information function allows for the spring application to retrieve data associated with presented media or active content from one or more third party services such as media databases entertainment servers etc. External content information may be based on a publish control metadata function which is configured to obtain and or store metadata for content presented by a display device. A notification feature allows for actions taken by the spring application to be provided to the display device. In which case the display device can acknowledge the action and present a message to the user that the action has been completed.

Search allows for configuration of a device to allow for customization of the spring presentation and for control of the device based on one or more settings.
