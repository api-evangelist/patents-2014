The user device can include a Printed Circuit Board PCB not shown electrically communicating with the aforementioned elements. A majority of the aforementioned elements can be mounted on the PCB or can be electrically connected to the PCB through an electrical connection means such as a Flexible PCB FPCB a cable and the like. The PCB can be a substrate on which a basic circuit and a plurality of electronic parts are mounted. The PCB can set an execution environment of the user device maintain information of the user device make the user device stably driven and make data input output exchange of all devices of the user device smooth.

Also the user device can include a housing . The housing can play a role of housing and fixing the aforementioned elements of the user device as well as form an appearance of the user device . Among the aforementioned elements the touchscreen the front and rear cameras and respectively the flash the external connector terminal and the like can be exposed through openings provided in the housing . The housing can have holes for sound inlet and outlet at portions in which the speakers and and the microphones and are overlapped.

The microphones and can introduce sounds through the holes and can convert the sounds into electrical signals. Also the PCB can process the electrical signals outputted from the microphones and . The sounds can be changed while being introduced into the microphones and . Accordingly acoustic characteristics of the electrical signals outputted from the microphones and can be varied respectively. Particularly acoustic characteristics of sounds introduced into the microphones and can be varied because the microphones and are distant from one another. For example in a case where a user speaks with seizing the user device and getting close to the face a sound introduced into the lower microphone can be large in volume while sounds introduced into the upper microphone and the rear microphone can be relatively small in volume. As a result acoustic characteristics of converted electrical signals outputted from the microphones and of the user device can be varied according to a situation of the user device . For example since the user device can be in various situations such as a situation of being seized with a user s hand a situation of being mounted on a dock a situation of being equipped with a cover and the like the acoustic characteristics of the converted electrical signals outputted from the microphones and can be varied. are example diagrams illustrating an amplitude and waveform of an echo which is introduced into each microphone when a user makes a call with a counterpart with seizing both sides of a user device and getting the user device close to the face according to the present disclosure. is an example illustrating an embodiment where the user stops a hole of the microphone close to the mouth with the other hand and is an example illustrating an embodiment where the user hides the mouth with the other hand. The term echo can refer to a phenomenon in which a sound wave coming out from a sound source reflects from an object surface and again returns to the sound source. In other words the term echo can refer to a phenomenon in which a counterpart s voice outputted through the earpiece speaker goes through a reflection path and is introduced into the microphones and together with a noise. Referring to it can be appreciated that a quantity of echoes inputted to the PCB through a path of the 1st microphone is the least. Referring to it can be appreciated that a quantity of echoes inputted to the PCB through a path of the 3rd microphone is the least. is an example illustrating waveforms of electrical signals outputted from a 1st microphone and a 2nd microphone when a user speaks with getting the mouth close to the 1st microphone disposed at a lower end of a user device according to the present disclosure. is an example of a waveform of the electrical signal outputted from the 1st microphone that is seriously distorted compared to the waveform of the electrical signal outputted from the 2nd microphone according to the present disclosure.

In a case of executing a microphone related function such as a call voice recognition voice recording and the like the present disclosure can selectively use a microphone outputting an electrical signal of an acoustic characteristic suitable to the function in consideration of a difference of acoustic characteristics of converted electrical signals outputted from the microphones and . The present disclosure can use the electrical signals outputted from the plurality of microphones and adaptively to the microphone related function. In other words when the microphones and output the electrical signals through the paths respectively the user device can switch the path for receiving the electrical signal according to the function. In one example of the electrical signal outputted from the 1st microphone can be unsuitable to voice recognition since it has a bad acoustic quality due to distortion. On the contrary the electrical signal outputted from the 2nd microphone can be suitable to the voice recognition since it has a relatively good acoustic quality compared to the electrical signal outputted from the 1st microphone . For example in comparison with the conventional art in a case of voice recognition a conventional user device can use an electrical signal outputted from a fixed and lower microphone for the voice recognition. However when a user covers up a sound inlet hole of the lower microphone with a finger the conventional user device can have difficulty with voice recognition. On the contrary when the user covers up a sound inlet hole communicating with the lower microphone the user device can conclude that the electrical signal outputted from the lower microphone is unsuitable to the voice recognition because of a bad acoustic quality and can make use of electrical signals of excellent acoustic qualities of other microphones and for the voice recognition. In other words the user device and the operating method thereof can selectively use an electrical signal of a specific microphone of an excellent acoustic quality suitable to a function.

For example when a call function is initiated the control unit can be configured to confirm a 1st microphone previously designated to the call function. The control unit can be configured to acquire from the host device information about microphones previously designated by function. Next the control unit can be configured to control the switch unit to electrically connect the permanent operation adaptive filter and the 1st microphone and electrically connect the 1st periodic operation adaptive filter and the 2nd microphone . The permanent operation adaptive filter can be configured to pass an electrical signal outputted from the 1st microphone and filter out an echo of a linear component from the electrical signal and can be configured to output the electrical signal filtering out the echo of the linear component to the host device . The host device can be configured to execute the call function using the electrical signal passing through the permanent operation adaptive filter . Here if an echo cancelation performance of the permanent operation adaptive filter falls equal to or less than a predetermined level or if a preset period arrives the control unit can be configured to operate the remnant echo detection unit and the remnant echo comparison unit .

As a result the permanent operation adaptive filter can have better performance when canceling an echo from an electrical signal outputted from the switched 2nd microphone than when canceling an echo from an electrical signal outputted from the previous 1st microphone . In other words in a case of using the 2nd microphone the permanent operation adaptive filter can better decrease the remnant echoes included in the electrical signal outputted to the host device than before. An electrical signal of a less echo component can be advantageous for execution of a function of the host device .

In an embodiment if the 1st remnant echo is less than the 2nd remnant echo the control unit can be configured to maintain the electrical connection between the permanent operation adaptive filter and the 1st microphone and maintain the electrical connection between the 1st periodic operation adaptive filter and the 2nd microphone .
