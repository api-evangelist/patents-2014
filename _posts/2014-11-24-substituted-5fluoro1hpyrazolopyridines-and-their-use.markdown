This disclosure is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 13 851 373 filed Mar. 27 2013 which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 13 111 856 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 420 656 and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 to German Application No. 102010021637.2 filed May 26 2010 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.

The present application relates to novel substituted 5 fluoro 1H pyrazolopyridines to processes for their preparation to their use alone or in combinations for the treatment and or prophylaxis of diseases and to their use for producing medicaments for the treatment and or prophylaxis of diseases in particular for the treatment and or prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders.

One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate cGMP . Together with nitrogen monoxide NO which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals it forms the NO cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyze the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate GTP . The known representatives of this family can be classified both according to structural features and according to the type of ligands into two groups the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one haem per heterodimer which is part of the regulatory site. It is of central importance for the activation mechanism. NO is able to bind to the iron atom of haem and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Haem free preparations cannot by contrast be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide CO is also able to attach to the central iron atom of haem but the stimulation by CO is distinctly less than that by NO.

By forming cGMP and owing to the resulting regulation of phosphodiesterases ion channels and protein kinases guanylate cyclase plays an important role in various physiological processes in particular in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells in platelet aggregation and platelet adhesion and in neuronal signal transmission and also in disorders which are based on a disturbance of the abovementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions the NO cGMP system may be suppressed which may lead for example to high blood pressure platelet activation increased cellular proliferation endothelial dysfunction atherosclerosis angina pectoris heart failure myocardial infarction thromboses stroke and sexual dysfunction.

Owing to the expected high efficiency and few side effects a treatment of such disorders which targets the influence of the cGMP signal path in organisms and is NO independent is a promising approach.

Hitherto for the therapeutic stimulation of the soluble guanylate cyclase use has exclusively been made of compounds such as organic nitrates whose effect is based on NO. This is formed by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attack at the central iron atom of haem. In addition to the side effects the development of tolerance is one of the decisive disadvantages of this type of treatment.

In recent years some substances have been described which stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase directly i.e. without prior release of NO such as for example 3 5 hydroxymethyl 2 furyl 1 benzylindazole YC 1 Wu et al. 84 1994 4226 M lsch et al. 120 1997 681 fatty acids Goldberg et al. 252 1977 1279 diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate Pettibone et al. 116 1985 307 isoliquiritigenin Yu et al. 114 1995 1587 and various substituted pyrazole derivatives WO 98 16223 .

WO 00 06569 discloses fused pyrazole derivatives and WO 03 095451 carbamate substituted 3 pyrimidinylyrazolopyridines as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase.

It is an object of the present invention to provide novel substances which act as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase and which have an identical or improved therapeutic profile compared to compounds known from the prior art such as for example with respect to their in vivo properties such as for example their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behaviour and or their dose activity relationship.

The present invention further provides medicaments which comprise at least one compound according to the invention typically together with one or more inert nontoxic pharmaceutically suitable auxiliaries and the use thereof for the aforementioned purposes.

The compounds according to the invention may act systemically and or locally. For this purpose they can be administered in a suitable manner for example by the oral parenteral pulmonal nasal sublingual lingual buccal rectal dermal transdermal conjunctival otic route or as an implant or stent.

The compounds according to the invention can be administered in administration forms suitable for these administration routes.

Suitable administration forms for oral administration are those which work according to the prior art which release the compounds according to the invention rapidly and or in a modified manner and which contain the compounds according to the invention in crystalline and or amorphized and or dissolved form for example tablets uncoated or coated tablets for example with gastric juice resistant or retarded dissolution or insoluble coatings which control the release of the compound according to the invention tablets or films wafers which disintegrate rapidly in the oral cavity films lyophilizates or capsules for example hard or soft gelatin capsules sugar coated tablets granules pellets powders emulsions suspensions aerosols or solutions.

Parenteral administration can bypass an absorption step e.g. intravenously intraarterially intracardially intraspinally or intralumbally or include an absorption e.g. intramuscularly subcutaneously intracutaneously percutaneously or intraperitoneally . Administration forms suitable for parenteral administration include preparations for injection and infusion in the form of solutions suspensions emulsions lyophilizates or sterile powders.

For the other administration routes suitable examples are inhalable medicament forms including powder inhalers nebulizers nasal drops solutions or sprays tablets films wafers or capsules for lingual sublingual or buccal administration suppositories car or eye preparations vaginal capsules aqueous suspensions lotions shaking mixtures lipophilic suspensions ointments creams transdermal therapeutic systems e.g. patches milk pastes foams sprinkling powders implants or stents.

The compounds according to the invention can be converted to the administration forms mentioned. This can be done in a manner known per se by mixing with inert nontoxic pharmaceutically suitable excipients. These excipients include carriers for example microcrystalline cellulose lactose mannitol solvents e.g. liquid polyethylene glycols emulsifiers and dispersing or wetting agents for example sodium dodecylsulphate polyoxysorbitan oleate binders for example polyvinylpyrrolidone synthetic and natural polymers for example albumin stabilizers e.g. antioxidants for example ascorbic acid dyes e.g. inorganic pigments for example iron oxides and flavour and or odour correctants.

In general it has been found to be advantageous in the case of parenteral administration to administer amounts of about 0.001 to 1 mg kg preferably about 0.01 to 0.5 mg kg of body weight to achieve effective results. In the case of oral administration the dosage is about 0.01 to 100 mg kg preferably about 0.01 to 20 mg kg and most preferably 0.1 to 10 mg kg of body weight.

It may nevertheless be necessary where appropriate to deviate from the stated amounts specifically as a function of the body weight route of administration individual response to the active compound nature of the preparation and time or interval over which administration takes place. For instance in some cases less than the aforementioned minimum amount may be sufficient while in other cases the upper limit mentioned must be exceeded. In the case of administration of relatively large amounts it may be advisable to divide these into several individual doses over the course of the day.

A commercially available telemetry system from DATA SCIENCES INTERNATIONAL DSI USA is employed for the blood pressure measurements on conscious rats described below.

The telemetry system makes it possible to continuously record blood pressure heart rate and body motions of conscious animals in their usual habitat.

The investigations are carried out on adult female spontaneously hypertensive rats SHR Okamoto with a body weight of 200 g. SHR NCrl from the Okamoto Kyoto School of Medicine 1963 were a cross of male Wistar Kyoto rats with highly elevated blood pressure and female rats having a slightly elevated blood pressure and at F13 handed over to the U.S. National Institutes of Health.

After transmitter implantation the experimental animals are housed singly in type 3 Makrolon cages. They have free access to standard feed and water.

The day night rhythm in the experimental laboratory is changed by the room lighting at 6.00 am and at 7.00 pm.

The telemetry transmitters TA11 PA C40 used are surgically implanted under aseptic conditions in the experimental animals at least 14 days before the first experimental use. The animals instrumented in this way can be employed repeatedly after the wound has healed and the implant has settled.

For the implantation the fasted animals are anaesthetized with pentobarbital Nembutal Sanofi 50 mg kg i.p. and shaved and disinfected over a large area of their abdomens. After the abdominal cavity has been opened along the linea alba the liquid filled measuring catheter of the system is inserted into the descending aorta in the cranial direction above the bifurcation and fixed with tissue glue VetBonD 3M . The transmitter housing is fixed intraperitoneally to the abdominal wall muscle and layered closure of the wound is performed.

An antibiotic Tardomyocel COMP Bayer 1 ml kg s.c. is administered postoperatively for prophylaxis of infection.

Unless indicated otherwise the substances to be investigated are administered orally by gavage in each case to a group of animals n 6 . The test substances are dissolved in suitable solvent mixtures or suspended in 0.5 strength Tylose appropriate for an administration volume of 5 ml kg of body weight.

The telemetry measuring unit present is configured for 24 animals. Each experiment is recorded under an experiment number Vyear month day .

Each of the instrumented rats living in the system is assigned a separate receiving antenna 1010 Receiver DSI .

The implanted transmitters can be activated externally by means of an incorporated magnetic switch and are switched to transmission in the run up to the experiment. The emitted signals can be detected online by a data acquisition system Dataquest A.R.T. for Windows DSI and be appropriately processed. The data are stored in each case in a file created for this purpose and bearing the experiment number.

The acquisition of measured values is repeated under computer control at 5 minute intervals. The source data obtained as absolute value are corrected in the diagram with the currently measured barometric pressure Ambient Pressure Reference Monitor APR 1 and stored as individual data. Further technical details are given in the extensive documentation from the manufacturing company DSI .

Unless indicated otherwise the test substances are administered at 9.00 am on the day of the experiment. Following the administration the parameters described above are measured over 24 hours.

After the end of the experiment the acquired individual data are sorted using the analysis software Dataquest A.R.T. Analysis . The blank value is assumed to be the time 2 hours before administration of the substance so that the selected data set includes the period from 7.00 am on the day of the experiment to 9.00 am on the following day.

The data are smoothed over a presettable time by determination of the average 15 minute average and transferred as a text file to a storage medium. The measured values presorted and compressed in this way are transferred into Excel templates and tabulated. For each day of the experiment the data obtained are stored in a dedicated file carrying the number of the experiment. Results and test protocols are filed in paper form sorted by numbers.

Representative values for the compounds according to the invention are shown in the table below Table 3
