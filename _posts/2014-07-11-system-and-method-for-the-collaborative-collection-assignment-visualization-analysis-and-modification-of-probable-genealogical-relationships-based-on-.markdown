This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 106 056 filed Dec. 13 2013 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 375 922 filed Jun. 8 2010 and issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8 731 819 on May 20 2014 and is a national stage entry of PCT US10 037699 filed Jun. 8 2010 which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 185 696 filed on Jun. 10 2009 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The invention relates in general to database schema design and processing and more particularly to systems methods apparatus and media for organizing and analyzing genealogical information.

Biological Who Online and offline research into one s family tree. This may include collateral lines and through the use of DNA can include deep ancestral origins.

Temporal When Researching and recording when our ancestors were born baptized married had children died and were buried. This may also include capturing other major and minor life events that can be embodied in a timeline.

Socio economical What Researching recording and understanding the social and economic context in which our ancestors lived their lives. This may include religious and political party affiliations religious and cultural practices church membership political offices held military service and rank group memberships education occupations held supplier and customer relationships income investments net worth asset analysis interests attitudes and opinions.

Historical Why Researching and understanding the historical context within which our ancestors lived social and religious movements macro economics cultural political and technological trends regional rivalries war et. al.

Much of a researcher s initial focus is on capturing the first two dimensions Who and When. Where is almost incidental a traceable source citation for future research. As researchers gain more experience and can devote the time some will focus on the dimensions of What and Why to gain insight into their ancestors lives in context and may be getting a deeper understanding of themselves in the process.

However when you take into account available technology and the relative lack of mobility before the introduction of the steam train and the automobile or where physical geography hindered mobility or where geography and culture intersect the Where dimension becomes the dominant dimension in your family tree. The Where determines the pool of potential mates. The Where determines access to food water energy and raw materials. The Where influences one s economic opportunity but also one s risk profile with respect to war crime natural and man made disasters pestilence disease and famine.

Moreover location is an actual determinant in the probability that two people within geographic proximity are related. Tobler s 1970 first law of geography that everything is related to everything else but near things are more related than distant things has been rigorously verified in the field of geographical genetics. It has also been demonstrated in the field of geographical genetics that relatives will exhibit some degree of spatial proximity and spatial neighbors will exhibit some average excess of relatedness.

Bearing in mind the problems and deficiencies of the prior art one or more objects of the present invention may be to provide an improved system and method for the geo spatial capture and transcription of family trees vital records census records land transfer records cemetery records and organizational membership records.

It may be another object of the present invention to provide a system and method for assigning deterministic and probabilistic relationships between people in geographic proximity.

A further object of the invention may be to provide a system and method for visualizing known probable and potential relationships in a geo spatial context over time.

Still other objects and advantages of the invention will in part be obvious and will in part be apparent from the specification.

The above and other objects which will be apparent to those skilled in the art are achieved in the present invention which is directed to systems methods apparatus computer readable media non transitory computer readable media and or computer program products that identify and associate individuals by at least providing a first set of records associated with one or more individuals at a defined geographic location and a defined period of time and providing a second set of records associated with individuals across multiple geographic locations and defined time periods. The method also includes selecting a desired demarcated area of the Earth selecting a desired date range and searching identifying and returning the set of individuals corresponding to the selected demarcated area and date range. The method then includes associating relationships among the set of returned individuals who previously had no identified relationships in the first and second sets of records corresponding to the demarcated area and date range. The method steps of searching identifying returning and associating relationships are performed on a computing device which may either be a stationary device mobile device or combinations thereof.

The first set of records may be selected from vital historical affiliation group census directory and or other records while the second set of records may be from pedigree genealogical lineage ancestral family history and or other records. The relationships may be pedigree relationships non pedigree group or affiliation relationships.

The first set of records may be created by transcribing a series of geotagged digital images of inscribed memorials extracting location of the transcribed geotagged digital images and identifying physical proximity of the imaged inscribed memorials within a physically demarcated area. The user inputs determinable relationships between transcribed individuals.

In one or more embodiments the first set of records may be created by transcribing a series of geotagged digital images of headstones family plots or other inscribed memorials within a cemetery. The first set of records may further be created by extracting location of the transcribed geotagged digital images and identifying physical proximity of the imaged headstones and inscribed memorials within a physically demarcated area. The user inputs determinable pedigree based relationships between transcribed individuals and inputs possible yet indeterminable from the first and second sets of records pedigree based relationships between transcribed individuals. Any possible yet indeterminable pedigree relationship between two individuals are propagated as a hypothetical syllogism to associate the relationships among the set of returned individuals who previously had no identified relationships in the first and second sets of records.

The memorial may be an inscribed battlefield memorial town memorial or other public memorials with a plurality of inscribed individuals. The first set of records may further include group affiliation of the transcribed individuals.

In another embodiment the set of returned individuals have the same surname and the method further includes providing a table of surname commonality frequency for a defined geographic region within a specific period of time and using the table of surname commonality frequency to associate the relationships among the set of returned individuals who previously had no identified relationships in the first and second sets of records.

The method may include further identifying geographical locations in the records that include the individuals and are isolated and using the identification of isolated geographical locations to associate the relationships among the set of returned individuals who previously had no identified relationships in the first and second sets of records. The isolated geographical locations may be separated by distance from other groups of individuals or by the effects of weather or may be defined by physical geographical barriers such as rivers mountains islands or deserts.

In another embodiment the first or second set of records may include identifications of location of origin of an individual and the returned set of individuals are in contemporaneous geospatial proximity and the method further includes identifying the preponderance of the location of origin of the returned set individuals and using the preponderance of the location of origin of the returned set individuals to associate the location of origin relationships among the set of returned individuals who previously had no identified location of origin relationships in the first and second sets of records. The location of origin may be an ancestral city town village or neighborhood of origin. The identification of location of origin of an individual includes immigration or emigration records associated with one or more individuals.

In one or more embodiments the first and second sets of records may be provided by a mobile device. Also the method may include using the associated relationships to generate a family tree based on the multiple geographic locations and defined time periods.

In some embodiments the method may be performed on a social networking site. The social networking site may be directed to a specific function or purpose or to a general purpose social networking site. The user may be provided with the results of the associated relationships among the set of returned individuals at which point the user may realize the existence of a social networking site and then request to join the social networking site.

The method then includes providing an association of at least two of the first second third fourth and fifth set of records into linked and related data elements comprising individuals entities geographical location date range of association and their relationships. The method further includes selecting one or more desired individual attributes selecting a desired demarcated area of the Earth selecting a desired date range and searching identifying and returning the linked and related data elements of individuals and entities corresponding to the selected individual attributes demarcated area and date range. The method then includes displaying one or more of a the relationship between the returned individuals and entities within a geo spatial and temporal context b the related data elements of the returned individuals and entities within a geo spatial and temporal context and c the resolution of the location information associated with the returned individuals and entities within a geo spatial and temporal context.

In one or more embodiments the first set of records may include but are not limited to vital historical affiliation group census directory and other records. The second set of records may include but are not limited to pedigree genealogical lineage ancestral family history and other records. In certain embodiments the current location of the user may be derived from a global positioning systems receiving device and or the current location of the user may be a geocoded street address.

In various embodiments the desired demarcated area of the Earth may be identified as one or more of the current location of the user on the Earth latitude and longitude and a maximum drive time T the current location of the user on the Earth latitude and longitude and a maximum walking time T a specific point on the Earth latitude and longitude and a radius R a specific physical address and a radius R a current political boundary the political boundary or boundaries extant in the desired date range a cadastral map or maps extant in the desired date range a historical map or maps extant in the desired date range a street number range for a defined street in a political boundary extant in the desired date range a census enumeration district extant in the desired date range a legislative district or districts extant in the desired date range a well defined parcel associated with an historical event such as a battlefield a USGS Feature Name and radius R a user defined irregular polygon. The desired demarcated area of the Earth may also be identified as an established neighborhood extant in the desired date range for example Beekman Carnegie Hill Central Park South Chelsea. Chinatown Clinton East Harlem. East Village Financial District Gramercy Park Greenwich Village Harlem Inwood Little Italy Lower East Side Midtown East Morningside Heights Midtown West Murray Hill Soho Sutton Area Tribeca Upper East Side Upper West Side Washington Heights and West Village in New York City. The desired demarcated area of the Earth also contains a USGS Feature Class.

The desired individual attribute may relate to an individual s major life events such as birth existence marriage parentage immigration to emigration from or death e.g. all people who lived within 2 miles of a particular Church between 1860 and 1880. The desired individual attribute may also be a surname or substring of a surname or group affiliation or affiliations. The latter include e.g. church memberships fraternal orgs veterans orgs public service orgs employment affiliation creed or all members of the G.A.R who lived between 1825 and 1900 in Connecticut. The desired individual attribute may also be the individual s birth location e.g. all individuals in the desired geographic area who were born in Piaggine Italy. Further the desired individual attribute may be one or more of country of origin the individual s port of emigration the individual s port of immigration gender racial classification age range naturalization status year of emigration or immigration occupation life experience shared by two or more individuals and membership in a family. The desired individual attribute may be individual record ownership status and a record may be designated as public or private to the user. The desired individual attribute may also relate to any combination of the above listed attributes.

The entity may be a physical structure associated with one or more individual s habitation interaction or activity a port of embarkation or disembarkation a specific instance of a mode of transportation or a physical structure that memorializes one or more individual s lives habitation interactions or activities.

The association of the first second third fourth and fifth set of records into linked and related data elements may be created and maintained in a centralized database management system or may be maintained with a federated database management system.

A representation of returned individuals entities their relationships to each other and related data elements may be displayed as hovering over a 3 dimensional rendering of the Earth within a user selectable time period. The representation of an individual or entity may be displayed as connected to one or more associated locations within the 3 dimensional rendering of the Earth is a function of the resolution of the associated location. For example an individual associated with a location that is just Pennsylvania would be at a height above the centroid of the state of Pennsylvania New York City would be at a height above the centroid of NYC Battery Park would be at the height above the centroid of BP. An associated location may be displayed as connected with a physical location on the surface of the 3 dimensional rendering of the Earth if and only if the location is defined by or derived to a latitude longitude pair or a postal address that includes a valid street number street name city state province country and postal code.

An associated location may be displayed as hovering above the centroid of the demarcated area on the surface of the 3 dimensional rendering of the Earth for partial addresses street number ranges current and past political boundaries historical maps census enumeration districts current and past legislative districts user defined polygons cadastral maps established neighborhoods and other publicly defined parcels. An associated location may be displayed as hovering above the centroid of the demarcated area on the surface of the 3 dimensional rendering of the Earth at varying heights based on the resolvability and accuracy of the source location to be geocoded.

If no associated location is specified for an individual or entity a default location is assigned for that individual or entity and is displayed as outside the upper bound of the exosphere of the 3 dimensional rendering of the Earth.

The representation of returned individuals and entities may be displayed as connected to one or more associated locations through colored line segments. The representation of returned individuals may be displayed as connected to each other through colored line segments. The representation of returned individuals and entities may be displayed as connected to each other through colored line segments and or as connected to related data elements through colored lined segments. The colored line segment may denote the type of association between two or more representations of individuals.

The set of determinable pedigree based associations between two or more representations of individuals may be displayed as including relative to relative relative to non relative relative to relative by marriage non relative to non relative and combinations thereof. For instance these relationships may include but are not limited to parent to child sibling to sibling spouse to spouse grandparent to grandchild aunt uncle to niece nephew cousin to cousin parent in law to son daughter in law and the like and even combinations thereof. 

The association of pedigree between two or more individuals may alternatively be displayed as possible yet indeterminable. The association of two or more individuals may be displayed as including an identifiable group affiliation which may include a historical group affiliation or a user defined group affiliation. For instance the display of representation of returned individuals entities their relationships to each other and related data elements may be displayed as hovering over a 3 dimensional rendering of the Earth in an animated time sequence.

The method may further include graphically linking to the representation of an individual entity or related data elements further data elements associated with an individual entity or related data elements through a colored line segment. The colored line segment denotes the type of related data element to the representation of an individual or related data elements. The method also may further include enabling or disabling the graphical linking to the representation of an individual to any other representation of an individual or related data elements.

The returned linked and related data elements of individuals and entities are displayed as corresponding to the selected individual attributes demarcated area and date range may be used as the plurality of records to narrow or extend the set of returned linked and related data elements of individuals and entities.

In one or more embodiments the methods of the invention may be performed on a mobile device whereby the results of the method are displayed to a user on the mobile device. Also the linked and related data elements of individuals and entities corresponding to the selected individual attributes demarcated area and date range may be conflated into a family tree.

In various embodiments the method may be performed on and the results displayed on a social networking site. The social networking site may be directed to a specific function or purpose e.g. a social networking site directed solely to searching establishing generating and or linking a family tree and or familial lineage or to a general purpose social networking site e.g. a social networking site that includes a feature for searching establishing generating and or linking a family tree and or familial lineage .

A user of the invention may realize the existence of a social networking site due to the displayed results whereby the user may request to join the social networking site. The computing device itself may identify one or more social networking sites based the input data or it may identify one or more social networking sites based the selected individual attributes demarcated area and date range. In either instance a user may request to join one or more of the identified social networking sites.

The present invention is also directed to methods of identifying a social networking site based on geo spatial and temporal context data relating to individuals and entities and their relationships to each other. The methods at least include inputting into a computing device various sets of records associated with individuals across multiple geographic locations and defined time periods and inputting a geo based query into the computing device that at least includes identifications of a desired demarcated area of the Earth and a desired date range selected by a user. The computing device identifies a social networking site based on the input geo based query and outputs an identification of the social networking site to a user of the invention.

In one or more embodiments the various sets of records input into the computing device include a first set of records associated with one or more individuals at a defined geographic location and a defined period of time and a second set of records associated with individuals across multiple geographic locations and defined time periods. Still further records may include a third set of records of probable genealogical relationships among two or more individuals across multiple geographic locations and time periods a fourth set of historical records associated with one or more entities at a defined geographic location and a defined period of time and a fifth set of spatial geographical historical and other records associated with one or more locations within a defined time period. An association may be provided of at least two of the first second third fourth and fifth set of records into linked and related data elements comprising individuals entities geographical location date range of association and their relationships.

The method may further include searching identifying and returning a set of individuals corresponding to the selected demarcated area and date range. Relationships may also be associated among the set of returned individuals who previously had no identified relationships in the first and second sets of records corresponding to the demarcated area and date range.

The geo based query may also include one or more desired individual attributes. In these embodiments the computing device may search identify and return the linked and related data elements of individuals and entities corresponding to the selected individual attributes demarcated area and date range. Also one or more of the following may be displayed a the relationship between the returned individuals and entities within a geo spatial and temporal context b the related data elements of the returned individuals and entities within a geo spatial and temporal context and c the resolution of the location information associated with the returned individuals and entities within a geo spatial and temporal context.

These embodiments of the invention may be performed on a mobile device whereby the results of the method are displayed to a user on the mobile device. Alternatively the methods may be performed on a stationary device. The social networking site may be a general purpose social networking site or it may be a specific function or purpose social networking site e.g. directed to the specific function or purpose of generating or searching one or more family trees or family lineage .

In certain embodiments a variety of different social networking sites are identified whereby a user may request to join one or more of such social networking sites.

The present invention is further directed to computer readable medium embedded with a computer program of instructions executable by the computer program storage devices and computer program products all for performing the various embodiments and methods of the invention as discussed above and in more detail below.

The invention provides systems methods apparatus computer readable media non transitory computer readable media and or computer program products that 

Assist users in the geo spatial capture and transcription of family trees vital records census records land transfer records cemetery records and organizational membership records Assist users in assigning deterministic and probabilistic relationships between people in geographic proximity and

Assist users in visualizing known probable and potential relationships in a geo spatial context over time.

Geographic distance is a significant and frequently primary determinant of genetic variation between populations within a relatively small geographic region. Geographic distance limits migration such that the genetic similarity between populations decreases with increasing geographic distance. Transportation technology and infrastructure limit migration the further one goes back in time. The physical geography topography and climate also limit migration.

Cemetery stone here the geo spatial proximity is deterministic. People buried with the same surname in geo graphic proximity are related. Cemetery stones sometimes indicate family patterns but sometimes they do not. For example a male buried next to a female under one headstone could be husband wife brother sister father daughter aunt uncle niece nephew cousin cousin and the like without any other identifying information.

Cemetery plot a cemetery plot is similar to a cemetery stone with the exception that it is a larger contiguous demarcated geo spatial area that likely contains more than one stone and may contain stones with more than one surname. For example if a cemetery plot contains headstones with the name Gracy Dutton and Munson it may be assumed that these people are somehow related even if it is not apparent from the information contained on the stones. Moreover if deterministic relationships can be ascertained with a subset of the people in a plot then the probabilistic relationship with one individual can be propagated to all individuals within the plot.

Cemetery applying the first law of geography to matched surnames within a contiguous cemetery over time indicates a higher likelihood the people are somehow related as well as the deterministic relationships of those individuals.

Neighborhoods are geographically localized communities within a larger village suburb town or city. Neighborhoods are often social communities with considerable face to face interaction among members. The spatial division of cities into districts or neighborhoods is one of the few universals of urban life from the earliest cities to the present. In the words of the urban scholar Lewis Mumford Neighborhoods in some primitive inchoate fashion exist wherever human beings congregate in permanent family dwellings and many of the functions of the city tend to be distributed naturally that is without any theoretical preoccupation or political direction into neighborhoods. Most of the earliest cities around the world as excavated by archaeologists have evidence for the presence of social neighborhoods.

Neighborhoods are typically generated by social interaction among people living near one another. In this sense they are local social units larger than households that are not directly under the control of city or state officials. In some preindustrial urban traditions basic municipal functions such as protection social regulation of births and marriages cleaning and upkeep are handled informally by neighborhoods.

Neighborhoods in preindustrial cities often had some degree of social specialization or differentiation. Ethnic neighborhoods were important in many past cities and remain common in cities today. Economic specialists including craft producers merchants and others could be concentrated in neighborhoods and in societies with religious pluralism neighborhoods were often specialized by religion. One factor contributing to neighborhood distinctiveness and social cohesion in past cities was the role of rural to urban migration. This was a continual process in preindustrial cities and migrants tended to move in with relatives and acquaintances from their rural past.

For example in part because of the social and political divisions of the Italian peninsula southern Italian villages tended to be isolated and insular and new immigrants tended to preserve this isolation in their new country clustering together in close enclaves. In some cases the population of a single Italian village ended up living on the same block in New York or even the same tenement building and preserved many of the social institutions habits of worship grudges and hierarchies from the old country. In Italy this spirit of village cohesion was known as campanilismo loyalty to those who live within the sound of the village church bells.

There can be a very precise geo demographic identification. Mulberry Street in New York for example became distinctly people from Naples Mott Street between Broome and Grand was claimed by the Calabresi Hester Street was Apulian. The length of Elizabeth Street was not only Sicilian it was settled by town from south to Spring the immigrants came from Palermo from Spring to Grand they came from Siacca from Grand to Hester from Messina.

Therefore if one can identify the predominant ethnic country regional and village of origin within a defined geo spatial area and timeframe then any random individual within the geo spatial area and timeframe will have a probable geographic relationship to the same country region village of origin.

Villages. Towns and Regions based on time and relative geographic isolation and limited transportation technology mobility the first law of geography applies. It has been shown that the most common and proximal cause of spatial structure is the limited dispersal of individuals. Limited dispersal causes genetic isolation by distance to build over generations. For example within a population even if initially the spatial distribution of individual genotypes were random limited dispersal means that individual genotypes in the next generation will not be. Then when dispersal is limited during the mating cycle of the next generation there is an excess of matings among spatially proximal individuals who are related beyond average. The progeny of the third generation will be more intensely spatially structured than the second and so on. Relatives will exhibit some degree of spatial proximity and spatial neighbors will exhibit some average excess of relatedness. Note that the above identifies regions instead of specific counties or states. Political boundaries at this level are less important in location based genealogy. For example if a family is located in Northwest Conn. then the genealogical region of interest could include east central New York southwestern Massachusetts Litchfield County western Hartford County and northern New Haven County.

Super regions and Countries wider dispersal patterns lower the probability of relatedness. However by employing knowledge of surname frequencies and historical migration patterns one can identify likely individuals of potential interest.

A cadastral map is a comprehensive register of the metes and bounds of real property of a country. A cadastre commonly includes details of the ownership the tenure the precise location some include GPS coordinates the dimensions and area the cultivations if rural and the value of individual parcels of land.

A date range is defined as the period of time between two dates. A date can be defined as just a year a month and a year a specific month day and a year and a specific time month day and year where time is defined in HH MM SS hours minutes seconds .

A surname is defined as a name shared in common to identify the members of a family as distinguished from each member s given name. Also called family name last name.

Geotagged means the process of adding geographical identification meta data to various media such as photographs and video. This meta data usually consists of latitude and longitude coordinates though they can also include altitude bearing accuracy data and place names.

Referring to the drawings each of the embodiments of the present invention utilize a common database to store and manage location based genealogical family history memories facts events and other related information organized in a geo spatial temporal and social network context. Beyond standard genealogical programs which organize search and visualize data based on biological relationships over time the system provides a capability to define leverage and associate geo spatial temporal and other user defined attributes meta data to recorded individuals objects and entities and to use those attributes to query visualize analyze and or update establish probable familial and social networks in space and time.

Furthermore referring to the invention provides a means for information terminals with embedded Global Positioning Systems GPS and broadband internet access to be notified of their geo spatial proximity to locations associated with recorded individuals objects and entities in that database based on pre established user preferences associated with the aforementioned attributes.

The various embodiments of the invention all access the common database and provide a user interface and workflow by various means. The database is securely hosted behind a firewall and is accessed only via specific functionality provided by servers including for instance server hosted web applications web client applications or database servers that interact with exposed web based application programming interfaces.

Specifically the data collection embodiments provide novel directed user workflows designed to efficiently transcribe and derive entity and attribute information and store it in the common format. The workflows are designed to allow the user to capture information that is discernable from the various sources but is generally not captured nor displayed by traditional methods.

An additional set of embodiments provide the means for users to retrieve information and create insight from the data that has been collected. These embodiments provide novel abilities to query the data interactively and to visualize the results in 2 or 3 dimensional geo spatial and temporal context.

The system is web based and utilizes a storage means to record individual entity and object information as well as the associated attributes and inbound outbound relationship metadata. The storage means will be accessible via the above embodiments. The embodiments encapsulate the workflows conditional logic and web enabled browser based user interface to allow a global base of users to collaboratively collect assign visualize analyze and modify probable genealogical and affiliate relationships in a geo spatial and temporal context.

Additional embodiments will also expose a service based application programming interface API that can be called from remote clients that have a resident user interface application. These remote client applications may be developed either as an integral part of the system or may be third party applications interacting with the system.

These embodiments contain the workflow and conditional logic to capture and derive information and attribute and relationship meta data associated with the relational data entities associated with a cemetery or memorial. The following information and meta data elements will be populated as driven by the workflow in the user experience in the embodiment 

Family history is generally represented by a biological or genetic family tree also called a pedigree which shows the past and present members of the family joined together by a series of links that help in ascertaining their relationship to each other and the location documentation and recording of a family history.

One or more embodiments of the invention extend the definition of relationships beyond deterministic biological marital and legal relationships that are typically associated with genealogy. In the various embodiments of the invention an attribute of fuzzy relationships is are generated and implemented in the invention. The fuzzy relationship s data is a form of multi valued data derived from fuzzy i.e. probable data set theories for providing approximate reasoning as compared to precise reasoning. Just as in fuzzy set theory the set membership values can range inclusively between 0 and 1 in fuzzy logic the degree of truth of a statement can range between 0 and 1 and is not constrained to the two truth values true false as in classic predicate logic.

As will be described in more detail below this fuzzy relationship s data may be used to determine Relationships between people and events geo spatially and over time. In so doing unique family trees may be generated in accordance with the invention using this Relationship data whereby such family trees will have people and event related branches that are generated geo spatially and over time.

The fuzzy relationship data sets are used in one or more embodiments of the invention to determine whether or not two or more people are somewhat related . This is accomplished by determining whether two predetermined fuzzy data sets intersection one another. These predetermined fuzzy data sets include Geo Spatial Proximity i.e. the relationship between two people at a moment in time and Surname Frequency. shows the plotted relationship of individuals as a function of Geo Spatial Proximity while shows the plotted relationship of individuals as a function of Geo Spatial Proximity and Surname Frequency.

In accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention the following fuzzy logic equation may be used to determine whether or not two individuals are to some degree related. The two individuals are represented by the tuple namely surname 1 location 1 and time 1 and surname 2 location 2 and time 2 where time 2 is greater than or equal to time 1 . The degrees to which such two individuals may be related include but are not limited to related somehow related most likely related may be related may be unrelated most likely unrelated somehow unrelated and unrelated.

The fuzzy logic equation s for determining whether or not two individuals are to some degree related may be as follows 

IF location 1 and location 2 are within the same fixed populated fixed centroid e.g. gravestone graveplot memorial THEN the individuals are somehow related.

IF location 1 and location 2 are within a variably populated fixed centroid a home AND time 1 equals time 2 THEN the individuals are most likely related.

IF location 1 and location 2 are within a defined variably populated variable centroid e.g. neighborhood village AND time 2 is greater than time 1 3 generations 75 years THEN the individuals may be related.

IF surname 1 matches surname 2 AND surname 1 2 is NOT COMMON AND location 1 and location 2 are within a defined variably populated variable centroid e.g. neighborhood village AND time 2 is greater than time 1 3 Generations THEN the individuals are most likely related.

If surname 1 matches surname 2 AND location 1 is near location 2 AND time 2 is greater than time 1 3 Generations AND time 2 is less than the year 1920 THEN the individuals may be related.

If surname 1 matches surname 2 AND surname 1 2 is RARE AND location 1 is near location 2 THEN the individuals are most likely related.

If surname 1 matches surname 2 AND the surname is COMMON AND location 1 is far from location 2 AND time 2 is greater than time 1 THEN the individuals may be unrelated.

If surname 1 does not match surname 2 AND location 1 is far from location 2 THEN the individuals are most likely unrelated.

The one or more embodiments of the invention provide the concept of degrees of relatedness based on the use of fuzzy logic which is collapsed to the binary state of related or unrelated as more information or data becomes available. The value to genealogist of fuzzy relationships is that the invention provides documented clues to potential or possible familial relationships based on geographic and temporal proximity without having to commit these leads to a traditional genealogical database that is designed around pedigrees. The invention therefore provides a valuable lead generation tool for genealogists and family historians. Moreover there is a network effect in that the more geo spatially based information available the more valuable the information becomes.

The various embodiments of the invention may also be implemented to introduce the attribute of degrees of relatedness and the propagation of this fuzzy relationship to other individuals in a fixed centroid. For example in if two individuals with different surnames buried in the same plot are determined to be somehow related then all the members within the same plot will be considered to be somehow related.

Moreover if any one member of a defined pedigree lineage has a fuzzy relationship with an individual then the relationship status of that individual is propagated to all known members of the pedigree.

The various embodiments of the invention also provide the ability for any registered user to override any and all fuzzy relationships and collapse them to traditional defined pedigree relationships with source citations or no relationships also with source citations .

For instance a working example of the invention may utilize a combination of relational data at the person relationship level for specific relationships relational data between people and centroids and a procedural mechanism to retrieve a relationship list for a person that combines this data.

Relationships also have beginning and ending dates. These dates utilize the varying resolutions described above.

Locations are described and stored in two preferred manners. The first is geographic coordinates of longitude and latitude and the second is an address such as a specific street address or more general town or ZIP code address. Locations may also include elevation or height above the earth at a given coordinate.

Interested individuals and local historical societies regularly engage in the practice of transcribing cemeteries to help in the cause of capturing genealogical data for posterity. However current practices for capturing this data are inefficient and fail to capture a majority of the available information. Further typical current outputs of this activity are unstructured text based representations of the buried persons with some data from their stones such as birth and death dates. Additionally current data is visualized and reported in an alphabetical manner such that it loses much if not all of the geo spatial context of the buried individual s person s .

In one or more embodiments geographically oriented genealogical data is retrieved stored and organized by starting with the transcription of data available in cemeteries. The various embodiments of the invention provide structured methodologies and storage for efficiently recording significantly greater amounts of information from cemeteries as compared to current practices. In so doing one or more embodiments of the invention include and implement digital cameras mobile devices GPS enabled digital devices personal computers the internet and the like. The invention provides a rich and detailed record of cemeteries including locations images plots stones people and relationships between people.

In one or more embodiments the invention involves activities by persons performing different roles which may be performed by the same person or different people. These roles may include for instance a photographer taking digital photographs of cemeteries as well as the individual headstones and monuments within the cemetery. Preferably these photographs are geo coded. The photographs are also preferably taken in an organized manner to facilitate easier transcription. Other roles include a transcriber recording the information embodied in the photographs in a structured manner. This information may include but is not limited to names dates relationships religion and military service as well as the photograph or photographs of the stones and their locations. Still another role is a Reviewer who is responsible for reviewing and approving the transcriptions.

The activity of cemetery transcription involves processing a series of images or photographs taken in a cemetery whereby the information captured in these images or photos is extrapolated and entered into the various embodiments of the invention as data for the individuals or persons that the pictures represent. shows a workflow for gathering photographic data from a cemetery plot in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. shows a display or user interface for transcribing the data gathered in whereby the main transcription screen may have data entry fields on one side and image photo display s on an opposite side of the screen. In so doing a transcriber may select an image photo and extrapolate data there from and enter such data into the present systems apparatus and processes of the invention. Location data may also be set from any location data obtained from the photos.

In the various embodiments of the invention a photographer and a transcriber may be the same person or different persons. As shown in the photographer first takes a photograph of a cemetery stone or plot step . Since the photographer and transcriber may be different people or the same person performing both tasks at separate times it is important that the photographs be taken in an order that conveys information.

Also the photographer s may determine plot boundaries while on site and communicate these boundaries to the transcriber to indicate that a set of stones are part of a specific plot. Cemetery plots are often demarcated by corner monuments or other means and these attributes may be used to determine the plot boundaries. Other attributes that may be used to generate plot boundaries may include a photograph of a first indicator card e.g. a colored card green card a card that recites start etc. at the start of a plot and a photograph of a second indicator card e.g. a different colored card red card a card that recites end etc. at the end of a plot. One or more photographs of the plot as whole may also be taken and can be associated with the plot data. In generating plot boundaries a photograph may be taken to mark the start of a plot and after all members of a plot are photographed a subsequent photograph is taken marking the end of the plot. The plot starting and ending photographs may be of a standard item that makes and defines them as identifiable members of a given plot.

Once the photographs are taken these photographs are uploaded either individually or in batch mode from the picture taking device e.g. camera mobile phone etc. step onto a computer by any appropriate means e.g. transfer via cable transfer of memory chip to computer. The photographs are then uploaded to a database via the internet and servers steps for use by the transcriber. It should be appreciated that steps and may be combined when the picture taking device is included in a device that has communication capabilities e.g. a mobile phone whereby the images are uploaded directly to the database without the need for a separate computer to perform the upload tasks.

After the photography data has been uploaded to the database this data is then displayed to a transcriber such as on a user interface as shown in for transcribing or extrapolating the data. show the process flow of transcribing the data gathered by the photography stage. The transcription stage at least determines whether any plot boundaries exist and determines any relationships as described in detail above within the determined plot.

The process begins step by creating a new job or selecting an existing job step uploading any photographs that have not been previously uploaded step and beginning reviewing the uploaded images step . An image that identifies a particular cemetery e.g. a cemetery sign cemetery monument etc. is first selected step and if it is a new cemetery that is not already identified or registered with the invention this new information e.g. cemetery name address location coordinates etc. is retrieved from the photograph or other identifying images material supplied by the photographer and entered into the systems and apparatus of the invention step .

Once the identification and coordinates of a given cemetery is determined a default plot is automatically established within the invention step . The process flow proceeds to determining whether or not any more images have been uploaded for the selected cemetery step and if not the process flow ends step . If there are more images relating to the selected cemetery then the next image is selected step followed by determining whether this next image is the beginning marker for a new plot step . If the next image is the beginning of a plot then a new plot is started and any and all related settings for such plot are associated therewith step .

The process repeats back to determining whether or not any more images exist after the previous image and if not the process ends step . If more images do exist the next image is selected and this process is repeated for each image until it is determined that one of the images is the end marker of the plot step . Once the end marker image has been identified and as such the boundaries of the plot identified any and all relationships within the identified bound plot are retrieved and assigned to the individuals within such bound plot step . The process flow of steps may be repeated if it is determined that another image exists for the bound plot in step .

In the event that the first image retrieved is not associated with a new plot step nor is it an end marker of a plot step it is then determined if the image is that of a single stone in a cemetery step . If it is not a single stone then a default error occurs and the process flow ends step . However if the image is that of a single stone then the process flow continues by transcribing or extrapolating the data from the stone step . One or more embodiments of this process flow are shown in which is described below.

If the image being transcribed is that of a single stone the stone is transcribed step by creating a file for a new stone and entering any genealogical relevant data viewable on the image of the stone step including that of the location of the stone if such information is available step . These steps are performed for all person s individual s listed on the stone by generating for each person individual step listed thereon a file containing an identifier of each person along with any other data that is obtainable from the stone for such person step . This includes entering any discernable membership data step and military service data step and the like.

Once these steps and data files are generated for all persons listed on the stone the process then determines whether one or more persons are listed on the stone step . If more than one person is listed on the stone the relationships are determined between the individuals identified on the stone step followed by creating any new relationships that may be found to exist in accordance with the invention step . This may be accomplished by using the inverse relationships of the invention.

After relationships on a single stone have been determined or if there is only one person listed or identified on the stone relationships with people on previously reviewed and extrapolated stones are determined and input into the systems and apparatus of the invention step . These relationships identified from different stones may be input after each relationship is determined or at the end of analyzing an entire plot of stones step . Once the stone transcription process is complete this data may be used in determining and extrapolating relationships for a given plot.

While relate to transcribing data from a cemetery setting it should be appreciated and understood that the invention may be implemented with any type of genealogical or person s identifying data. For instance one or more embodiments may provide for transcribing data from federal and state census records into a common format utilized in accordance with the invention. The transcription front end interface of the invention is designed such that the entry method mimics the form that the data is commonly available in the year and location the census was taken. This provides for an efficient and effective transcription workflow.

Other embodiments also provide for transcribing vital records into a common format of the invention. Vital Records are records maintained by civil authorities that record critical life events including but not limited to births deaths divorces and marriages. Each vital record not only includes pedigree information but it also includes location based information such as where someone was born where someone died where someone was married or where a divorce was decreed.

Again it should be appreciated that the data transcribed in accordance with the various embodiments of the invention is not stored in a manner that is specific to census or vital records but rather in common formats that allow searching visualization location aware prompts and tools to explore enhance and derive information about people their lives and their relationships with other people both in terms of genetic relationships and common events and activities in their lives for genealogists and researchers of the past. That is the present transcription tools allow for the gathering entering and exploitation of data from multiple different sources including but not limited to public physical memorials e.g. cemeteries public records e.g. vital records and census records electronic sources e.g. databases personal e.g. entered from an individual s knowledge personal vital records including for example memories and or events as discussed further below and the like. The transcription tools take all of these different types of data and convert and consolidate it all into a common format. These transcription approaches of the invention are fundamentally different from currently existing systems which are limited to providing access to separate databases that are individually queried using search parameter s and then the data obtained being indexed in accordance with the format that is specific to the searched database.

The one or more embodiments of the invention provide an improved and more powerful user experience allowing users to relate and visualize the gathered data in a unique manner that provides improved genealogical search results over that which is currently available. For instance understandings and realizations of relationship linkages or relationship data may be obtained in accordance with the invention which might otherwise have been missed by the conventional approaches of searching individual census or vital records. Additionally the relationship data may be shared by members of the user community allowing each user to collectively gain and share insights that they alone would not have a view or proper perspective thereof.

Memories are a form of personal vital records that are remembrance s of any activity and or event s associated with a particular location that are of significance to a person or persons. Memories may be recorded with an address date or date range description optional pictures videos or other attached elements. The use of generalized memories provides the invention with a level of hierarchy not implemented in current genealogical research approaches. In particular memories provide a rich history of a person s life and a mechanism to record a wide range of significant events in a person s life including but not limited to schooling employment celebrations weddings or any other event chosen by the genealogist for capture.

One or more embodiments of the invention may implement the use of memory data to identify connections or relationship linkages between people through such memory data regardless of whether particular memory data has been entered by separate people without knowledge of each other. This memory data may be searched with respected to location and time both visually and through queries. The use of memory data provides a new dimension to the hunt for genealogical information and or relationship linkages.

Since data entered into the present embodiments of the invention will be collected overtime by potentially different people and from different sources it is important for transcribers and users to be able to understand if the geo spatial centric data they are entering describes new people and events or if it should be considered to be adding to the description of previously entered data by other individuals.

Components of the invention may aid in the enhancement of previously captured data. For instance components of the invention may extend existing concepts of community based information recording such as Wiki type systems for providing the ability to perform community based geo spatial capture and joining together information about the relationships between people as well as between people and events and or memories. This may include user driven methods to join together information about individuals from different users that span a number of different locations as well as the ability to join together information about locations across time and or across a number of different individuals. For example dozens of families may have lived in a home that was built in the US Colonial Period or alternatively a family may have lived in a dozen locations.

The invention is also suitable for use with data pertaining to geo coding of historical locations that are referred to differently over time. Political boundaries across the globe have changed throughout human history by conquest annexation warfare treaty plebiscite legislation and other means. Geo locations provide specific longitude and latitude points that are constant. If a physical location is properly geo coded it can be referred to and displayed correctly even if the political unit it is affiliated with changes over time.

A current challenge for researchers is that location centric data acquired from historical records describes locations based on political boundaries that were only valid at the time of capture and may no longer exist or have been materially changed at the time day such data is being researched. The present invention provides accurate geo coding from historical data even when these boundaries have changed. In so doing the invention automatically combines digitized images and associated metadata of historical maps to underlying geo spatial rendering engines such as Google Earth in both data capture and data visualization as a function of the temporal value of the geo spatial record. This allows location centric data to be co presented in the historical geo spatial political context as well as current day to assist in geo coding in data entry and visualization of data queries.

This mechanism can be automatically extended as new cases of boundary changes at points in time that are discovered and made aware to the system. Geo coding from historical data has application both in genealogy and outside of it and the present invention discloses and provides for general use of this concept.

The various embodiments of the invention provide unique systems methods and computer program media and or products for visualizing how people lived their lives and the relationships between people events and locations. These visualization embodiments provide valuable insight into data that aids researchers in discovering information that may not otherwise be obtainable. In so doing the invention utilizes both time and space including both 2 and 3 dimensional space in combination with the data captured via the data capture embodiments discussed above to generate geo temporal visualization data that is interactively displayed to users.

In one or more embodiments the visualized data elements may include but are not limited to objects events organizations memories and other entities having specific locations dates and times of where and when they occurred that are of interest to a given person. In other embodiments the visualized data elements may include but are not limited to relationships between entities having type information and or descriptions as well as having date time or date time ranges. The visualized data elements may further include but are not limited to virtual entities that represent people or other entities whereby these virtual entities help to group relate visualize understand and provide insight into the visualized data. It should be appreciated that the visualized data may also include any combination of the foregoing.

For ease of understanding the following steps and description refer to the Information Visualization System shown in .

Step A user provides input into the invention through a user interface of a client device by a combination of entering query parameters that limit the search of data to their areas of interest display parameters that indicate how to display the data and direct interaction with the visual display data to zoom pan rotate etc. The flow that is shown here starts with the user interacting with parameters that will affect the type of data that is or is to be displayed to the user.

There are multiple forms of client devices that interact over the internet with the hosted solution. The user interacts with the user interface on the client device which in turn communicates with the hosted solution. It should be appreciated that the user interface of the client device may take various forms with common denominators to each that information is displayed to the user on the client device and that each form provides input to the client device. The user interface may be hosted through a combination of functionality on the client device and the hosted solution optionally with more functionality being provided on either the client or the host.

Examples of user interfaces suitable for use in the present invention include but are not limited to the user interface being a browser with all web pages served by the host the user interface being a browser with an embedded plug in to display geographic information the user interface being a browser with an embedded plug in that hosts application logic the user interface being a client application the user interface being an application that runs on a handheld mobile device the user interface being a social networking site directed solely to or alternatively at least including genealogical research or familial linkages e.g. a social networking site aimed at establishing a person or persons family tree the user interface being a networking site directed to geo temporal visualization data and mapping and the like.

Step The client device sends a request to the communication interface of the hosted solution along with the input data that has been entered or changed on the user interface.

Step The hosted solution works in both a state full and stateless manner. In instances when the application is hosted the hosted solution maintains session state. Those parameters entered into the user interface that will affect the rendering of the visual representation of the geospatial data are stored in the query data store.

Step Using this refreshed data the client device then updates portions of the display that have changed and an updated display is visualized by the user.

Step In some instances user interaction with the invention may result in the data visualization display needing to be updated. Alternatively this may be triggered by the visualization system itself such as by periodic polling or device location events requesting data for a new location.

Step When updating is required requested or needed the invention sends a request from the client device to a communication interface of the hosted solution to provide such updated data.

Step The host system responds to this request by returning a representation of the geospatial data in a form that the visualization embodiment can use to render the data on the representation of a portion of the earth. The application logic fetches data from the query data store for the session and combines it with the query data from the visualization system.

Step The application logic uses the combined query data as parameters for one or more queries sent to the geospatial temporal relational database.

Step Geospatial temporal relational data obtained from the database is returned in relational form to the application logic.

Step The application logic transforms the relational data into a format such as KML that can be interpreted by the visualization embodiment of the invention.

Step The visualization renders the returned data into the current view of the earth which may be 2 or 3 dimensional and displays it to the user.

The invention may also be used to generate and display data depending upon Levels of Service . In so doing the invention may expose varying amounts of information to different categories or levels of users. Some information may be exposed to all anonymous users additional information may be exposed to users who register with the service and even more information may be made available to paying customers. There may be a work sharing arrangement with respect to paying customers. For example photographing a cemetery may count for x number of months subscription. There may also be recognition displayed for service to the online community.

One or more embodiments may be implemented with the notion of Permission Based Advertising. Special advertising opportunities may exist in the visualization space due to a target audience being specifically interested in a particular service s . For instance while searching geographically a target audience may want to be shown resources that can help them with their search. This may include local experts local historical societies local lodging etc. An end user may be given the option to explicitly turn this feature on or off. The Permission Based Advertising of the invention both improves users experiences by offering such users additional functionality while not cluttering their experience if they are not currently interested in it and it provides a higher value advertising opportunity by offering adds to highly targeted potential customers.

Again the various embodiments of the invention provide unique systems methods and computer program media and or products for visualizing Relationships between people as well as between people and entities that are associated with them. Discovering and understanding the relationships between people is critical to understanding our genealogical roots and establishing a familial linkage or tree. These Relationships may be displayed to a user by various connections linkages and or visualized by connecting the entities.

In one or more embodiments the established Relationships may be displayed by visually connecting related entities with vectors. The Relationships may also be animated displays over a time range of relationships and related entities. The invention also provides the ability to navigate between connected entities by selecting control handles located at each end of the relationship vectors. As such the invention may provide for establishing unique family trees that have people and event related branches generated geo spatially and over time. Representing relationships as connections between people spatially on the earth and over time provides significantly more information visually as opposed to a traditional family tree that is established at a given time and location.

While these visualization concepts of the invention have broad application within the genealogical field e.g. by generating a family tree based on Relationships between people and events geo spatially and over time it should be appreciated and understood that such visualizations of the invention have application outside of the field of genealogy e.g. mapping out a mafia tour etc. Another application of the present visualizations outside of the genealogical field may include an online community networking that allows users to link with other users whereby the present visualization techniques may be used to represent Relationships between such linked users.

Referring to a display showing connection of related individuals on a 3 dimensional rendering of the Earth is shown. These related individuals may be connected by color coding to show types of relationships such as spouse parent child sibling etc.

The invention also enables navigation between people and events on the earth. Selecting a person or other entity such as a monument or memory may cause navigation handles to be displayed for all of the entities that are related to the selected entity. That is as people and their events are displayed visually one can navigate between them automatically by selecting control handles. The viewpoint may be animated to the selected entity. Double clicking on one of these handles may cause the camera to move to the related entity which provides a powerful approach for navigating through and exploring relationships.

As shown in the connection of additional related individuals may be added at any time during or after a session of the invention. For example multiple wives children and step children may be viewed both without respect to time as well as viewed over a specific time or time frame.

The concept of virtual entities is introduced to visualize and group information logically. Virtual entities are visual and data elements that are not tied to a specific location but may be viewed and connected to location based entities and serve to connect such entities. An example of a virtual entity is a virtual person. A virtual person has a great many attributes but does not have a specific geographic location. Also a virtual person may have many related entities and having a virtual representation of the person on a map serves an important purpose in linking those entities into a coherent linkage or relationship data.

A virtual person may be located at a longitude and latitude that is coincident with a related entity is derived by some form of spatial averaging of related entities or is set specifically for the virtual person. Further the 3 dimensional space above the earth may be used for the virtual location above a given longitude and latitude. As such the present invention provides for visually linking related entities to virtual entities and depicting these entities in a 3 dimensional space or rendering.

Time stacking is defined as using the vertical axis above the earth to represent time. This allows the visualization and navigation of events over time by moving the camera location up and down over the earth. For example memories and a specific location may be visualized by stacked them above each other in time sequence. The vertical axis extending from the earth is then considered as time rather than simple altitude. The present invention provides the use of this space in this manner and the visualization techniques that may be associated with it.

The invention provides for representing the accuracy and or quality of geo coded results visually from a height above the ground to provide views that approximate the viewed area described by the accuracy. This height may be generalized e.g. a certain height for all state level accuracies or may be made more specific by providing a height based on the dimensions of the given state. The use of height is only one example of visualization techniques. Other examples may include field of view or width of viewport.

One or more embodiments of the invention also provide for a mobile device s that is are geo aware i.e. device that is aware of or capable of determining and identifying its physical location e.g. geo fences virtual perimeters etc. . These mobile devices may have for instance a slider or some other control that allows one to select a point in time and provide information of that point on the earth at time. For instance a history view may be provided in the device s field of view for viewing by the user. Uses include field based research and historical tours.

The invention may also be used for location aware research and or location aware groups. A location aware device may be used to provide alerts of topics of interest near the point on Earth that the device is located. As for location aware groups social networking collaborative research groups may define points of interest and allow members to be notified that they are in the vicinity of those points.

Various embodiments of the invention also allow for adding and subtracting from a result set based on parameters. This is particularly useful for complex searches where displayed results may be incrementally refined until a desired result has been reached. For example an initial search of values within a radius of a point may be refined by subtracting points within a smaller radius of a different point. This may also be done within a certain date range while not within another date range. Composite searches may be captured by multiple ordered sets of parameters and executed in multiple steps in the particular order. The invention also involves the specification and replay of these queries against a increasingly refined result set.
