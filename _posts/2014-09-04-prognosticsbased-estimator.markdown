All vehicles produced by manufacturers occasionally have to be repaired. In some cases a vehicle owner may notice a change in the performance of their vehicle prompting the vehicle owner to bring the vehicle to a repair shop to diagnose a problem and potentially repair the vehicle. In other cases an electronic control module of the vehicle may detect a fault and provide a malfunction indication via an instrument panel of the vehicle. If the vehicle owner notices the indication the vehicle owner may bring their vehicle to a repair shop for service. In either scenario the vehicle owner may be unaware of what type of service needs to be performed on the vehicle as well as the costs and labor time associated with the repair.

When an operator brings their vehicle to a repair shop for service it is generally expected and many times a legal requirement that a repair shop provide an estimate of charges to a customer prior to proceeding with the repair of the vehicle. In many cases as the examples above cite diagnostic efforts must be performed to determine the root cause and therefore arrive at an estimate of the repairs needed to address the symptom exhibited by the vehicle. Today the repair shop may offer to diagnose the vehicle and contact the vehicle owner later once the root cause has been identified. After the root cause has been identified a service writer may prepare a revised estimate of the repair costs and time. In many cases by the time a specific repair estimate has been prepared the vehicle owner is off site. For instance the vehicle owner may be at work or at home and may not be easily accessible. Additionally in some instances the repair shop may also charge the vehicle owner a diagnostic charge to cover the time needed by the repair shop to identify the root cause of a vehicle malfunction and prepare the estimate. Improvements are therefore desired.

When a vehicle is brought into a repair shop without a known repair to be performed currently there is not an efficient method for the service writer to give guidance on possible repairs and associated charges. Described herein are methods and devices for determining estimate information related to at least one potential vehicle fix for a vehicle based on vehicle information and content of a vehicle repair database. In some instances the vehicle repair database can include data gathered from multiple repair shops regarding repairs performed on various vehicles by the multiple repair shops. As described herein the data of the vehicle repair database can be used to determine frequencies with which problems with a vehicle arise as well as associated charges that could result based on historical failure data for particular vehicles or vehicle types.

Furthermore described herein are methods and devices for interacting with a vehicle diagnostic record to facilitate diagnosing the root cause of a vehicle malfunction. In some instances a first client device that receives vehicle information may interact with a vehicle diagnostic record by associating the vehicle information with the vehicle diagnostic record. A second client device may also interact with the vehicle diagnostic record by accessing the vehicle diagnostic record and referring to the associated vehicle information when diagnosing the root cause of a vehicle malfunction. The second client device may determine using the vehicle information a few of the top repair order items related to a vehicle type in at least one category of repair order items and provide a graphical representation of the top repair order items. For instance the top repair order items may include at least two of the top repaired components for a particular vehicle type. In some instances a service technician may use the graphical representation to quickly verify whether any of the top repaired components are malfunctioning for the particular vehicle that the service technician is diagnosing. The first or second client device may also perform various other functions when interacting with the vehicle diagnostic record as described herein.

In one example aspect a method is provided that involves determining by a computing device vehicle information that comprises a first vehicle identifier for a first vehicle. The method also involves determining by the computing device and based on the vehicle information at least two top repair order items in a first category of repair order items. The at least two top repair order items in the first category of repair order items are related to the first vehicle type and determined from among a plurality of repair order items in the first category of repair order items that are related to the first vehicle type. Additionally the method involves providing by the computing device and for display a graphical representation of the at least two top repair order items in the first category of repair order items.

In another example aspect a computing device that includes at least one processor and a computer readable medium is provided. The computer readable medium is configured to store instructions that when executed by the at least one processor cause the computing devices to perform functions. The functions include determining vehicle information that comprises a first vehicle identifier for a first vehicle type. The functions also include determining based on the vehicle information at least two top repair order items in a first category of repair order items. The at least two top repair order items in the first category of repair order items are related to the first vehicle type and determined from among a plurality of repair order items in the first category of repair order items that are related to the first vehicle type. And the functions further include providing for display a graphical representation of the at least two top repair order items in the first category of repair order items.

In still another example aspect a system that includes a first client device and a second client device is provided. The first client device is configured to receive via a first interface provided on the first client device vehicle information that comprises a first vehicle identifier for a first vehicle type and associate the vehicle information with a first vehicle diagnostic record corresponding to a first vehicle. The second client device is configured to determine based on the vehicle information associated with the vehicle diagnostic record at least two top repair order items in a first category of repair order items. The at least two top repair order items in the first category of repair order items are related to the first vehicle type and determined from among a plurality of repair order items in the first category of repair order items that are related to the first vehicle type and provide for display a graphical representation of the at least two top repair order items in the first category of repair order items.

The foregoing summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. In addition to the illustrative aspects embodiments and features described above further aspects embodiments and features will become apparent by reference to the figures and the following detailed description.

The following detailed description describes various features and functions of the disclosed systems and methods with reference to the accompanying figures. In the figures similar reference numbers identify similar components unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative system and method embodiments described herein are not meant to be limiting. It may be readily understood that certain aspects of the disclosed systems and methods can be arranged and combined in a wide variety of different configurations all of which are contemplated herein.

The example embodiments are applicable to a variety of repairable items such as a vehicle or some other type of repairable item. For purposes of this description a vehicle can comprise an automobile a motorcycle a semi tractor a light duty truck a medium duty truck a heavy duty truck a farm machine a boat or ship a generator an airplane an oil drilling rig or some other type of vehicle. A vehicle can include or use any appropriate voltage or current source such as a battery an alternator a fuel cell a capacitor and the like providing any appropriate current and or voltage such as about 12 volts about 42 volts and the like. A vehicle can include or use any desired system or engine. Those systems or engines can comprise items that use fossil fuels such as gasoline natural gas propane and the like electricity such as that generated by a battery magneto fuel cell solar cell and the like wind and hybrids or combinations thereof.

This disclosure discloses among other things methods and devices for determining estimate information related to at least one potential vehicle fix for a vehicle based on vehicle information and content of a vehicle repair database. In some instances the vehicle repair database can include data gathered from multiple repair shops regarding repairs performed on various vehicles by the multiple repair shops. For example the data of the vehicle repair database can be used to determine estimates of possible problems with a vehicle and associated charges that could result based on historical failure data for particular vehicles or vehicle types.

According to an example method a computing device can receive vehicle information that includes a vehicle identifier and vehicle usage data for a vehicle. In one embodiment the computing device can include a computing device in a server that is configured to communicate with a client computing device via a communication network. The vehicle information can include a year make and model YMM of the vehicle or a vehicle identification number VIN . A VIN may include a build date build site engine type or other information about a vehicle. The vehicle information can also include other types of information that differentiates different models or types of vehicles such as regular production option RPO codes that refer to a specific option or modification to a vehicle. For example the vehicle information may indicate that a vehicle includes a trailer hauling package or various other components that a vehicle can be manufactured or equipped with.

The vehicle usage data may be data that is indicative of how much the vehicle has been used. Vehicle use is typically measured in either miles or kilometers driven or hours of operation. For instance if the vehicle is an automobile or truck the vehicle usage data may be an odometer reading that indicates a number of miles driven by the vehicle. In another instance the vehicle may be a boat aircraft generator oil drilling rig and the vehicle usage data may be an hour meter reading that indicates a number of hours of operation. Thus the vehicle usage data may provide an indication of vehicle usage. Other examples of vehicle usage data may also exist. Although portions of this disclosure are described with respect to an odometer reading or mileage of a vehicle the examples are not meant to be limiting.

Additionally in some examples the vehicle information can include symptom information describing a condition of the vehicle. As an example the symptom information can be engine hesitates on takeoff or engine is overheating . In other examples the vehicle information can include one or more diagnostic trouble codes DTCs . A DTC may be a generic or manufacturer specific code that is used to identify vehicle problems such as Throttle Petal Position Sensor Switch Malfunction or Transmission Control System Malfunction . In still other examples the vehicle information can include an indication that a malfunction indicator lamp of the vehicle is illuminated. Other examples may also exist.

Based on the vehicle information the computing device can determine repair information of a vehicle repair database relating to the vehicle. The repair information can include at least one potential vehicle fix to a given malfunction. In one example the repair information can include one or more of the most frequently performed vehicle fixes for the vehicle within a range of the mileage of the vehicle. For instance if the vehicle is a vehicle sold under the trademark TOYOTA TUNDRA that has 47 000 miles the repair information can include the ten most frequently performed vehicle fixes for vehicles sold under the trademark TOYOTA TUNDRA having between 40 000 and 55 000 miles. Other examples are possible and the example is not meant to be limiting.

In an instance in which the vehicle information includes symptom information or a DTC the repair information can also include a successful fix percentage associated with the symptom information or DTC. For instance the successful fix percentage can indicate a percentage of similar vehicles with the same or similar symptom information that were successfully fixed by performing the at least one potential vehicle fix to the similar vehicles.

The computing device can also determine estimate information related to the at least one potential vehicle fix. Such estimate information can include a repair time and or repair cost for example. A repair cost may be a cost to perform a vehicle fix. That is the repair cost may be a cost that is charged to a customer to perform the vehicle fix. As such the repair cost can include a labor cost and can also include a cost of one or more parts as well as any other costs associated with performing the repair. The estimate information can also be provided to a communication network such that the estimate information can be provided to another computing device e.g. a client computing device of a repair shop .

In some examples the estimate information can enable a service writer to prepare an estimate for the at least one vehicle service. If the repair information identifies multiple vehicle fixes the service writer can use estimate information related to each of the vehicle fixes to request preapproval from a vehicle owner for one or more of multiple possible repairs. For instance when a vehicle owner brings the vehicle to the repair shop the service writer can request approval from a vehicle owner to perform one or more repairs if a technician determines that the vehicle requires one of the repairs.

Similarly the example method can allow a service writer to provide an estimate to a vehicle owner and seek preapproval for one or more repairs before the vehicle is brought to the repair shop e.g. over the phone via a webpage via a web based application etc. . In one example if a vehicle owner is given direct access to the web based application the estimate information provided to vehicle owner via the web based application may identify an estimated repair cost and or repair time without identifying the particular vehicle service that may need to be performed.

According to another example method a computing device can determine vehicle information that includes a first vehicle identifier for a first vehicle type. The first vehicle identifier can include a particular vehicle identifier that identifies a particular instance of a vehicle or the first vehicle identifier can include a generic vehicle identifier that identifies a vehicle type that includes the particular instance of the vehicle and one or more other additional instances of the vehicle. A particular vehicle identifier can for example include a VIN including a unique serial number of the particular instance of the vehicle. A generic vehicle identifier can for example include a YMM or a portion of a VIN without a unique serial number.

The computing device can be a client device that is configured to communicate with a server via a communication network. For instance the client device can access or receive a vehicle diagnostic record that includes the vehicle information.

The vehicle diagnostic record can be configured in various ways. In one example the vehicle diagnostic record may be a data file or data structure or group of data files or data structures that can travel e.g. be accessed by multiple computing devices e.g. a first client device used by a service writer and a second client device used by a technician . Accordingly the vehicle diagnostic record may be referred to as a traveler in portions of this disclosure.

In one embodiment the vehicle diagnostic record may be a data file or data structure that is uploaded to a central server for storage in a cloud computing environment. The vehicle diagnostic record may be accessible by one or more client devices and each of the one or more client devices can access supplement and or amend information of the vehicle diagnostic record using cloud collaboration technologies. For instance a server may centrally host software for interacting with vehicle diagnostic records and a client device may access the vehicle diagnostic records by executing a thin client via a web browser. Alternatively the client device may access the vehicle diagnostic record using an application programming interface.

In another embodiment the vehicle diagnostic record may be a data file that the computing device receives from another computing device e.g. a server or a client device . By way of example the computing device can receive a copy of a vehicle diagnostic record via a communication network. The computing device can then amend or supplement the vehicle diagnostic record and send the vehicle diagnostic record back to the computing device from which it received the vehicle diagnostic record or to another computing device .

Using the vehicle information the computing device can determine potential repair information related to the first vehicle type. For instance the computing device can determine at least two of the top repair order items in one or perhaps multiple categories of repair order items. Generally a repair order item can include any item listed in a repair order of a vehicle repair database. By way of example a repair order can include a variety of types of repair order items such as repaired components reported diagnostic trouble codes reported symptoms e.g. customer complaints causes of symptoms and corrections of symptoms among other possible items. Further repair order items may be associated with particular categories such as a repaired components category reported diagnostic trouble codes category and reported symptoms category. Thus in some examples using the vehicle information the computing device can determine one or any combination of at least two of the top repaired components related to the vehicle type at least two of the top reported DTCs related to vehicle type and at least two of the top reported symptoms related to the vehicle type. In other examples the computing device can provide less than two top repair order items related to the first vehicle type. For instance the computing device can determine zero or only a single top repaired component zero or only a single reported diagnostic trouble codes and or zero or only a single top reported symptom related to the vehicle type. In line with the discussion above the computing device can determine the potential repair information by querying a vehicle repair database that includes data gathered from multiple repair shops regarding repairs performed on various vehicles by the multiple repair shops.

Further the computing device can provide a display of a graphical representation of the determined potential repair information related to the first vehicle type. For instance the computing device can provide a display of one or any combination of the at least two top repaired components related to the first vehicle type the at least two top reported DTCs related to first vehicle type and the at least two top reported symptoms related to the first vehicle type. In one instance the computing device can provide the determined potential repair information for display on an interface of the computing device. A technician or other user can then interact with the computing device to determine additional information associated with the potential repair information.

As one example a technician can select a particular repair order item of the at least two top repair order items in a category. In response to receiving the selection the computing device can provide a display of one or more potential vehicle fixes associated with the particular repair order item. Additionally or alternatively the computing device can provide a display of a vehicle usage profile for the particular repair order item. For instance the vehicle usage profile may be indicative of a distribution of a plurality of repair orders over a plurality of vehicle usage intervals.

As further described below a user can interact with a graphical representation provided by the computing device in various other ways as well. For instance a user can use the interface to access potential vehicle fixes or vehicle usage profiles associated with particular DTCs or particular symptoms. Furthermore the user can select one or more potential vehicle fixes using the interface on the computing device. In one instance the one or more potential vehicle fixes may be a vehicle fix for inclusion within a repair estimate. For example when diagnosing a particular vehicle at a repair shop a technician can use the interface of the computing device to view potential vehicle fixes and select one or more appropriate vehicle fixes to be performed in order to repair the vehicle. In response to receiving a selection of a potential vehicle fix the computing device can associate the potential vehicle fix with a vehicle diagnostic record corresponding to the particular vehicle. As a result when a service writer or other user subsequently accesses the vehicle diagnostic record the service writer can view the potential vehicle fix selected by the technician.

Further in line with the discussion above in some examples a server that maintains the vehicle diagnostic record or another computing device can determine estimate information related to potential vehicle fixes that are associated with the vehicle diagnostic record. For example the estimate information may include a repair time and or repair cost. And the server can also associate the estimate information with the vehicle diagnostic record such that a service writer or other user can view the estimate information when accessing the vehicle diagnostic record.

As mentioned above this description describes several example embodiments. Within this description the articles a or an are used to introduce elements of the example embodiments. The intent of using those articles is that there is one or more of the elements. The intent of using the conjunction or within a described list of at least two terms is to indicate any of the listed terms or any combination of the listed terms. The use of ordinal numbers such as first second third and so on is to distinguish respective elements rather than to denote a particular order of those elements. The ordinal numbers can be written in the form of 1st 2nd 3rd and so on. This application hereby incorporates by reference the entire contents of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 019 503 filed Sep. 5 2013.

Additional functionalities and examples of the described methods and computing devices are also described hereinafter with reference to the accompanying figures.

Referring now to the Figures illustrates an example system . As shown in the example system includes one or more client devices a server a vehicle repair database and a communication network . The client devices can represent any type of mobile or stationary computing devices. By way of example the client devices can be one or more computers located at a repair shop. However the example is not meant to be limiting. In other instances the client devices can be laptop computers tablets cellular phones wearable computing devices or other types of computing devices.

The server can similarly be any type of computing device. In one instance the server can be located remotely from the client devices e.g. in a cloud computing environment . For example the server can be a desktop computer workstation or other type of computing device configured to operate within a client server architecture. In another instance the server can be a computing device that is located at a repair shop. For example the server may be a computing device used by a repair shop to manage repair orders or shop equipment that is used to diagnose and service vehicles. Other configurations are also contemplated.

Each of the client devices can include a processor and a memory . Similarly the server can also include a processor and a memory . The processor and the processor can be any type of processors such as a microprocessor digital signal processor multicore processor etc. coupled to the memory and memory respectively. The memory and the memory can be any type of memories such as volatile memory like random access memory RAM dynamic random access memory DRAM static random access memory SRAM or non volatile memory like read only memory ROM flash memory magnetic or optical disks digital versatile disk read only memory DVD ROM or compact disc read only memory CD ROM among other devices used to store data or programs on a temporary or permanent basis.

Additionally each of the client devices can include a communication interface and the server can include a communication interface . The communication interface and the communication interface can facilitate communication with the communication network for the client devices and the server according to one or more wired or wireless communication standards. For instance the communication interface and the communication interface can facilitate data communication via network links and . The communication interface and the communication interface can include a transmitter to transmit data and a receiver to receive data. Alternatively the communication interface and the communication interface can include a transceiver configured to transmit and receive data.

The vehicle repair database can be or include a data storage device such as a non transitory computer readable storage device. Although the vehicle repair database is shown connected to the server via the communication network in another embodiment the vehicle repair database can be directly connected to or a component of the server not shown . The vehicle repair database can store a plurality of repair orders. Each repair order can include information pertaining to repairing a vehicle. Additionally or alternatively each repair order can include other information such as information pertaining to performing preventative maintenance to a vehicle. The repair order can be created in an electronic format or can be prepared in paper format and manually entered into a computer or converted e.g. scanned to an electronic format. Text of a scanned repair order can also be recognized using optical character recognition OCR techniques. In some examples a repair order can be arranged as a structured query language SQL file. Alternatively or additionally a repair order can be arranged as an extensible markup language XML file.

By way of example a repair order can include a combination of any of a service provider identifier a date of service identifier a customer identifier that indicates a customer seeking service of a given vehicle vehicle information that indicates the given vehicle a service request indicating the complaint or service requested by the customer parts information indicating parts obtained for servicing the given vehicle and service procedure information carried out on the given vehicle.

A service provider identifier can include for example information that indicates a name and geographic location of the service provider. Vehicle information can include a VIN associated with the given vehicle a year make and model YMM of the vehicle a year make model and engine YMME of the vehicle or a year make model engine and system YMMES of the vehicle. Note that a system of a vehicle may sometimes alternatively be referred to as a category. A few examples of a system category of a vehicle include brakes steering and suspension for instance. Service procedure information can include labor operation codes LOCs that refer to a particular operation performed to the given vehicle. The LOCs can conform to those defined by a vehicle manufacturer a service provider that generates a repair order a service information provider such as Mitchell Repair Information LLC Poway Calif. or some other entity. The service procedure information can also identify a total cost for the service. Similarly the parts information can include a part description part number and or pricing information identifying any parts associated with the repair order.

In one embodiment repair orders can be stored in local computing systems of repair shops and can be backed up and transmitted to the vehicle repair database on a frequent basis e.g. hourly daily weekly etc. . When a request for estimate information is received the server can search the repair orders of the vehicle repair database . In some instances the vehicle repair database can also store search queries and associated search results from prior searches to facilitate quickly retrieving information from the vehicle repair database . For instance the server can be configured to access a list of prior searches before searching the entire vehicle repair database to identify whether search results are already stored by the vehicle repair database for a given search. The stored search results may also be updated on a periodic basis by the vehicle repair database . For example when the vehicle repair database is updated with new repair orders the server or a separate computing device may re search the vehicle repair database to update the stored search results.

As discussed briefly above data of the vehicle repair database can be used by a service writer of a repair shop to facilitate estimating the cost and or time to perform services. Turning now to is a block diagram of an example method for determining estimate information. Method shown in presents an embodiment of a method that could be used or implemented by the client devices of for example or by components of the client devices of or more generally by any of a variety of computing devices. Method can include one or more operations functions or actions as illustrated by one or more of blocks . Although the blocks are illustrated in a sequential order these blocks can also be performed in parallel and or in a different order than those described herein. Also the various blocks can be combined into fewer blocks divided into additional blocks and or removed based upon the desired implementation.

In addition for the method and other processes and methods disclosed herein the block diagram shows functionality and operation of one possible implementation of present embodiments. In this regard each block can represent a module a segment or a portion of program code which includes one or more instructions executable by a processor or computing device for implementing specific logical functions or steps in the process. The program code can be stored on any type of computer readable medium for example such as a storage device including a disk or hard drive. The computer readable medium can include non transitory computer readable medium for example such as computer readable media that stores data for short periods of time like register memory processor cache and random access memory RAM . The computer readable medium can also include non transitory media such as secondary or persistent long term storage like read only memory ROM optical or magnetic disks compact disc read only memory CD ROM for example. The computer readable medium can also be any other volatile or non volatile storage systems. The computer readable medium can be considered a computer readable storage medium for example or a tangible storage device.

In addition for the method and other processes and methods disclosed herein each block in can represent circuitry that is wired to perform the specific logical functions in the process.

Initially at block the method includes receiving via an interface of a computing device vehicle information comprising a vehicle identifier and vehicle usage data for a vehicle. In one instance a service writer or vehicle owner can manually input the vehicle identifier and an odometer reading by keying in or otherwise selecting the vehicle identifier and odometer reading via a user interface of the computing device. In another instance a service writer or vehicle owner can manually input the vehicle identifier and an hour meter reading using the user interface of the computing device. Alternatively the computing device may request the vehicle information or a portion of the vehicle information from an electric control unit of the vehicle by way of a wired or wireless vehicle data bus. In another example the computing device may receive a vehicle diagnostic report e.g. an email from a remote diagnostics system of a vehicle e.g. OnStar or another source . The computing device can then automatically parse the email to determine the vehicle information. The vehicle identifier can identify a particular vehicle. For instance the vehicle identifier can be a VIN. In another example the vehicle identifier can identify a particular vehicle type. For instance the vehicle identifier can include a YMM YMME or YMMES.

The vehicle information may also include symptom information describing a condition of the vehicle. The symptom information can identify a condition of the vehicle as reported by a customer for example. As an example the symptom information can indicate a symptom that is exhibited by the vehicle and or reported by a vehicle owner such as engine hesitates on takeoff rough engine idle engine cranks but won t start poor gas mileage or check engine light is on . A check engine light can also be referred to as a malfunction indicator lamp that when illuminated on an instrument panel of a vehicle indicates a malfunction of a computerized engine management system of the vehicle. Alternatively or in addition the vehicle information may include one or more DTCs and or an indication that a malfunction indicator lamp of the vehicle is illuminated.

At block the method includes providing by the computing device the vehicle information to a communication network. In one example upon receiving data indicating a request to determine estimate information related to one or more potential repair services the computing device can provide the vehicle information to another computing device e.g. a server by way of the communication network. For instance a service writer can click or otherwise select an icon press a button or key or otherwise trigger a request to retrieve estimate information. The computing device can then generate a request for estimate information based on the vehicle information provided via the interface. The request can then be transmitted by a communication interface of the computing device to the communication network.

At block the method includes receiving from the communication network at the computing device estimate information related to at least one potential vehicle fix for the vehicle. In one example in response to providing the vehicle information to the communication network the computing device can receive the estimate information. The estimate information related to the at least one potential vehicle fix can include a repair time and or repair cost. In an embodiment in which a vehicle owner is requesting the estimate information directly e.g. via a web based application the estimate information may identify the repair time and or repair cost without identifying the potential vehicle fix. As discussed above the repair cost may include any costs associated with performing the at least one potential vehicle fix such as labor costs and part costs. In an embodiment in which the vehicle information includes symptom information the estimate information related to the at least one potential vehicle fix can include a successful fix percentage associated with the symptom information.

Additionally or alternatively the estimate information can include a range of repair costs for the at least one potential vehicle fix. For instance the range of repair costs can indicate repair costs of service repairs that have recently been performed by competitors of a particular repair shop e.g. repair shops within a predetermined geographical area of a location of the particular repair shop . In such an instance the particular repair shop can be identified based on an identity of the computing device that provided the vehicle information. For instance the computing device can be registered with an entity that provides the estimate information such that the location of the particular repair shop is known.

In some examples the method can further include providing the estimate information for display via the interface of the computing device. For instance the estimate information can be provided for display to assist a service writer in preparing an estimate for a vehicle owner. In that regard the client devices of can include a display and a user interface not shown .

In another example the method can further include providing the estimate for display via a display of a vehicle. For instance if the vehicle information is received by the computing device from a remote diagnostics system of the vehicle the estimate information may be provided via the communication network to the remote diagnostics system for display within the vehicle.

In other examples the method can also include receiving from the communication network estimate information related to at least one future vehicle service for the vehicle. In some instances estimate information related to a future vehicle service s can assist a service writer in preparing a maintenance plan with a vehicle owner. The estimate information related to the future vehicle service can also include a repair cost and or repair time. The future vehicle service s can be determined based on failure trends of vehicles which are functionally similar to the vehicle.

In some instances functionally similar vehicles can be vehicles that are of a particular vehicle type e.g. the same YMM YMME or YMMES . As an example if the vehicle is a 2007 vehicle sold under the trademark CHEVY COBALT that has 75 000 miles a future vehicle service can be repairing replacing timing chain guides. Such a service can be noted for instance because data of a vehicle repair database indicates that timing chain guides usually wear out between 85 000 and 90 000 miles for 2007 vehicles sold under the trademark CHEVY COBALT. In other examples functionally similar vehicles can be vehicles that have the same engine or powertrain. Examples of functionally similar vehicles can also include vehicles that are sister vehicles such as a 2008 vehicle sold under the trademark FORD EXPLORER and a 2008 vehicle sold under the trademark MERCURY MOUNTAINEER or a 2002 vehicle sold under the trademark CHEVY CAMARO and a 2002 vehicle sold under the trademark PONTIAC FIREBIRD etc.

In further examples the method can also include receiving from the communication network estimate information associated with one or more related parts or services. For instance if the estimate information identifies a potential vehicle fix that involves removing and replacing a particular part of the vehicle the estimate information may also include information identifying one or more parts and or services that are related to the particular part. As an example the related parts may be parts that are of the same system of the vehicle as the particular part or parts that are connected to the particular part. For instance the particular part may be a water pump and the related parts may include a water hose.

As another example the related services may be services that may be performed more efficiently when performed in conjunction with the potential vehicle fix than when performed individually. For instance if the potential vehicle fix is replacing a water pump that involves removing one or more components of the vehicle to access the water pump a related service may be replacing a timing belt that also involves removing the same components of the vehicle. In some cases the estimate information received from the communication network may include a cost comparison that indicates a cost of performing the related service in conjunction with the potential vehicle fix and a cost of performing the related service independently of the potential vehicle fix e.g. during a separate repair to be performed at a later date . That is the computing device may receive data from the communication network that is indicative of a repair cost associated with performing the potential vehicle fix and the related service during a single repair and a repair cost associated with performing the potential vehicle fix and the related service during separate repairs.

In one instance a service writer can specify vehicle information via the interface . By way of example the interface displays vehicle information that includes a vehicle identifier 2007 vehicle sold under the trademark CHEVY COBALT mileage 58 456 and symptom engine hesitates on takeoff . In response to requesting estimate information related to the vehicle information estimate information can be received and provided for display via the interface .

As shown in the estimate information can include one or more potential vehicle fixes for the vehicle. In the example of two potential vehicle fixes are shown Throttle Position Sensor R R and Oxygen Sensor R R. R R can refer to remove and replace. For each of the potential vehicle fixes a repair cost and repair time are provided.

As further shown in in some examples estimate information can include a successful fix percentage corresponding to each potential vehicle fix. By way of example the Throttle Position Sensor R R is indicated to have a successful fix percentage of 70 . In one instance a successful fix percentage of 70 can be interpreted by a service writer to mean that out of all known 2007 vehicles sold under the trademark CHEVY COBALT having around 58 000 miles and exhibiting a symptom of engine hesitating on takeoff the symptom was successfully resolved by performing the Throttle Position Sensor R R service. Further information about the successful fix percentages is described below with reference to .

As shown in according to one example embodiment when a user hovers over or otherwise selects a repair cost for a vehicle fix a range of repair costs can be provided for display via the interface . An example method for determining a range of repair costs that can be executed by the server of for example is further described below with reference to . In the example shown in when a user hovers a pointer over the cost of the Throttle Position Sensor R R service a range of repair costs is displayed. In one instance the range of repair costs can be determined based on costs that repair shops within a predetermined range of a geographic location of a particular repair shop have reported for performing the service on 2007 vehicles sold under the trademark CHEVY COBALT. In another instance the range of repair costs can be determined based on costs that repair shops across an entire country have reported for performing the service on 2007 vehicles sold under the trademark CHEVY COBALT.

Additionally an indicator which illustrates how an estimate for performing a particular repair at a particular repair shop compares to prices that customers paid at other repair shops can also be provided for display via the interface . The other repair shops may be repair shops within a predetermined range of a geographic location of the particular repair shop for instance.

Other implementations are also possible and the example shown in is not meant to be limiting. Although the range of repair costs is illustrated as a graphic overlaying the interface in other instances a range of repair costs can be provided adjacent to the estimate information e.g. beside above below or provided in a separate display window.

Additionally the interface shown in illustrates a feature that can allow a service writer to determine information about future vehicle services to the vehicle. In one case when a user hovers over or otherwise selects a prognostics icon of the interface vehicle usage related problems for the type of vehicle specified are shown in a prognostics window . For example the prognostics window displays a list of future vehicle services that have been reported for 2008 vehicles sold under the trademark CHEVY SILVERADO having about or around 65 000 miles. In one example the vehicle services of the prognostics window are displayed in ascending order by frequency. For instance Timing belt replacement can be the service that has been reported to have been performed most often while Recalibrate TPMS tire pressure monitoring system validity enumerator can be the service that has been reported to have been performed the least often. An example method for determining future vehicle services is described below with reference to .

In some examples the interface can allow a user to click on or otherwise select a particular vehicle service to display more information about the particular vehicle service. By way of example illustrates a vehicle service description window that can be provided via the interface of . In one instance the vehicle service description window can be provided in a window that overlays the interface . In other instances the vehicle service description window can be provided in a separate display window. The vehicle service description window provides information related to the Timing belt replacement vehicle service such as a repair cost repair time description of the problem and consequence of the problem.

In some examples the interface may also allow a service writer to record a vehicle owner s comments about one or more of the future vehicle services. For example if a vehicle owner indicates that they are interested in performing one or more of the future vehicle services in the future a service writer can highlight or otherwise select the future vehicle service s . The interface may also generate a reminder that may trigger the service writer to remind the vehicle owner about the selected future vehicle service at a later date.

The prognostics window lists the top pattern failures for a vehicle 2008 vehicle sold under the trademark CHEVROLET IMPALA . The pattern failures can be sorted in order of most frequently reported pattern failures. Alternatively the pattern failures can be sorted alphabetically. For each of the failures a histogram is provided. The histogram can be determined based on vehicle usage data collected from other repair orders of a vehicle repair database. For instance a histogram for the tie rod end failure may be determined by identifying all repair orders of the vehicle repair database that involved repairing the tie rod end on a 2008 vehicle sold under the trademark CHEVROLET IMPALA and sorting the identified repair orders into bins based on reported odometer readings. In the example of each bin represents a 10 000 mile range. That is a first bin is 0 10 000 miles a second bin is 10 001 20 000 miles a third bin is 20 001 30 000 miles etc. In other examples other increments may be used. The histograms can be normalized histograms. That is the height of each bin may correspond to a percentage.

Additionally a mode of each histogram is easily identifiable in the prognostics window . By way of example the mode of each histogram is shown by a bin that is shaded. In practice the mode of each histogram may be displayed in a different color than other bins of the histograms such that the mode is easily identifiable to a user. Further as shown in a vehicle usage indicator can be displayed. The vehicle usage indicator indicates vehicle usage data for a particular vehicle. In some embodiments a user may choose one or more vehicle services to create an estimate for or add to an existing estimate based on a relationship between the vehicle usage indicator and one or more modes of the histograms. For instance since the histogram for the ball joint failure indicates that ball joints are usually repaired between 30 000 and 40 000 miles a service writer may check a check box next to the ball joint failure. In response to the service writer selecting the check box an estimate for repairing the ball joint may be determined. Alternatively the estimate for repairing the ball joint may be added to an existing estimate.

In other examples additional types of prognostics information can be provided. For instance a user can select one or more tabs to cause other prognostics information to be shown. By way of example the additional prognostics information may include the top DTCs reported for a particular vehicle type or the top symptoms reported for a particular vehicle type. The other prognostics information can also be graphically represented using histograms similar to the histograms shown in . Other examples are also contemplated.

Turning now to is a block diagram of another example method for determining estimate information. Method shown in presents an embodiment of a method that could be used or implemented by the server of for example or by components of the server of or more generally by any of a variety of computing devices. Method can include one or more operations functions or actions as illustrated by one or more of blocks . Although the blocks are illustrated in a sequential order these blocks can also be performed in parallel and or in a different order than those described herein. Also the various blocks can be combined into fewer blocks divided into additional blocks and or removed based upon the desired implementation. Each block can represent a module a segment or a portion of program code which includes one or more instructions executable by a processor for implementing specific logical functions or steps in the processor. In addition each block in can represent circuitry that is wired to perform specific logical functions in the process.

Initially at block the method includes receiving at a computing device vehicle information comprising a vehicle identifier and vehicle usage data for a vehicle. In one instance the computing device can be a server that receives data indicating the vehicle information from a client computing device e.g. a computing device at a repair shop .

In one example the vehicle identifier can identify a particular vehicle. For instance the vehicle identifier can be a VIN. In another example the vehicle identifier can identify a particular vehicle type. For instance the vehicle identifier can include a YMM YMME or YMMES. The vehicle usage data can be an odometer reading or an hour meter reading for example.

The vehicle information can also include or accompany symptom information. Alternatively the symptom information can be transmitted or received separate from the vehicle information. The symptom information can identify a condition of the vehicle as reported by a customer for example. As an example the symptom information can indicate a symptom that is exhibited by the vehicle and or reported by a vehicle owner such as engine hesitates on takeoff poor acceleration etc. In some instances the vehicle information can further include one or more DTCs or information identifying that a malfunction lamp indicator of the vehicle is illuminated.

In some examples the computing device can also receive repair shop information identifying a particular repair shop. For instance if a service writer sends the vehicle information to the computing device from a client computing device at a particular repair shop information identifying the particular repair shop and or the client computing device of the particular repair shop can also be provided. The repair shop information can include a unique repair shop ID repair shop name client computing device ID etc. The computing device can use the repair shop information to facilitate providing estimate information to the client computing device. The computing device can also use the repair shop information to facilitate determining customized estimate information.

At block the method includes based on the vehicle information determining by the computing device repair information that relates to the vehicle from a vehicle repair database. As described above the vehicle repair database can store a plurality of repair orders that each include information pertaining to repairing a vehicle and or preforming preventative maintenance. By way of example a repair order can include a combination of any of a service provider identifier a date of service identifier a customer indicator that indicates a customer seeking service of a given vehicle vehicle information that indicates the given vehicle a service request indicating the complaint or service requested by the customer parts information indicating parts obtained for servicing the given vehicle and service procedure information carried out on the given vehicle. In one embodiment repair orders can be stored in local computing systems of repair shops and can be backed up and transmitted to the vehicle repair database on a frequent basis e.g. hourly daily weekly etc. .

In one example the computing device can be configured to match the vehicle information with content of the vehicle repair database so as to identify repair orders relating to the vehicle information. Matching the received vehicle information to repair orders of the vehicle repair database can include searching or querying the vehicle repair database to correlate the vehicle identifier mileage DTCs and or symptom information with content of repair orders of the vehicle repair database. In one instance a combination of YMM YMME or YMMES and mileage can be used to filter repair orders of the vehicle repair database. Subsequently the identified repair orders can be further filtered based on keywords of the symptom information matching keywords of the identified repair orders or based on one or more DTCs. The vehicle repair database can also be configured or arranged to facilitate matching the received vehicle information to one or more repair orders.

In an example in which the computing device also receives repair shop information the content of the vehicle repair database can also optionally be filtered based on a geographic location of a particular repair shop that provides the vehicle information. For example the computing device can be configured to identify repair orders matching the vehicle information and associated with repair shops that are located within a predetermined geographical range of the particular repair shop e.g. within 25 miles 100 miles etc. or located within the same city as the particular repair shop.

Based on content of the vehicle repair database matching the vehicle information the computing device can determine the repair information. The repair information can include at least one potential vehicle fix to a given malfunction. In one example to determine the potential vehicle fix es the computing device can identify repair orders of the vehicle repair database that match the vehicle information and identify the service performed according to each repair order. The computing device can then determine from among the identified repair orders the most frequently performed services. In another example the vehicle repair database may store predetermined repair information that is organized e.g. grouped together or categorized by vehicle information. To determine the repair information the computing device can perform a data lookup keyed to the vehicle information. For instance given a vehicle identifier and mileage of a particular vehicle the computing device can retrieve from the vehicle repair data base a list of predetermined repair information for the particular vehicle. By way of example the predetermined repair information may identify the most frequently performed services for the particular vehicle e.g. the top ten most frequently performed services the top five most frequently performed services etc. . In other examples the predetermined repair information may identify any services for the particular vehicle that have been performed more than a predetermined number of times e.g. any services that have been performed more than fifty times any services that have been performed more than one hundred times etc. .

In some examples the repair information can also include a successful fix percentage associated with symptom information. In one instance the successful fix percentage associated with a particular vehicle fix can be determined based on the number of similar vehicles reporting the symptom information that were successfully fixed by the particular vehicle service. For example if the vehicle information is a 2007 vehicle sold under the trademark CHEVY COBALT having 50 000 miles and a symptom of engine hesitates on takeoff the computing device can identify one hundred repair orders for 2007 vehicles sold under the trademark CHEVY COBALT having between 40 000 and 60 000 miles and a symptom similar to engine hesitates on takeoff . The computing device can also determine that of the one hundred identified repair orders seventy of the repair orders indicate that the throttle position sensor was replaced. The successful fix percentage provided for the throttle position sensor R R service can therefore be 70 . In some instances if the computing device is unable to identify more than a threshold number of repair orders corresponding to a mileage of the vehicle the mileage range may be expanded or even not used as a filtering term.

At block the method includes determining by the computing device estimate information related to at least one potential vehicle fix. In one example the computing device can estimate a repair time and or repair cost associated with any of the potential vehicle fixes that have been determined. The repair cost may include any costs associated with performing the at least one potential vehicle fix. In one instance the computing device can determine a repair time for a potential vehicle fix based on a database of service labor time standards. The database of service labor time standards can include benchmarks for time required to perform various vehicle services repairs.

In some examples the computing device can estimate a repair cost by multiplying an estimated repair time e.g. a benchmark repair time by a shop labor rate. The shop labor rate can be a labor rate of a particular repair shop. For example if the computing device receives or otherwise determines repair shop information the computing device can identify a shop labor rate for the particular repair shop. The computing device can select the labor rate from a plurality of rates the particular repair shop uses e.g. normal hours rate after hours rate holiday rate weekend rate senior citizen rate etc. . In one instance the computing device can receive an indication of which labor rate to use along with the repair shop information. For example the computing device may receive data identifying which labor rate to use when receiving the repair shop information and based on the data identify the appropriate labor rate. Additional costs such as costs for parts or disposal of materials can also be factored into the repair cost. To determine the cost of parts or disposal of materials the computing device can access one or more electronic parts catalogs EPCs or access a table in the vehicle repair database that stores information regarding prices for parts and disposal of materials.

In other examples the vehicle repair database may store predetermined estimate information for a plurality of vehicle fixes and the computing device can determine the estimate information by performing a data lookup keyed to a potential vehicle fix.

In some examples the computing device can also determine a range of repair costs for one or more of the potential vehicle fixes. For example the computing device can determine a range of repair costs based on costs reported for a group of repair orders. In one example the repair orders can be repair orders for repair shops that are in the same city as a particular repair shop or within a geographical range of the particular repair shop. This information can enable a service writer of the particular repair shop to see how an estimated repair cost compares to a price that competitor repair shops can charge for the same vehicle fix.

In other examples the computing device can also determine the repair time based on a shop work load of a particular repair shop. For instance the computing device may access a repair shop schedule to determine how many vehicles are currently being serviced and when the service for the vehicles is scheduled to be completed such that a service technician would be available to perform the repair . Additionally or alternatively the computing device may determine whether any parts required for the repair are available based on an inventory of the repair shop . If one or more parts are unavailable the computing device may incorporate an estimated shipping time for obtaining the unavailable parts into the estimated repair time. At block the method includes providing from the computing device to a communication network the estimate information related to the at least one potential vehicle fix. In one instance the estimate information can be provided to a client computing device of a repair shop via the communication network such that a service writer can prepare an estimate for a vehicle owner. For example a service writer can use the estimate information to seek preapproval for performing one or more potential vehicle fixes if a service technician determines that a vehicle fix should be performed to resolve the symptom exhibited by the vehicle owner s vehicle.

In some examples the computing device can also determine estimate information associated with replacing one or more parts that are related to a potential vehicle fix or performing services that are related to a potential vehicle fix. For instance if the estimate information identifies a potential vehicle fix that involves removing and replacing a particular part of the vehicle the computing device can also determine a repair time and or repair cost of removing and replacing one or more parts that are related to removing and replacing the particular part and or performing one or more related services that are related to removing and replacing the particular part.

As an example the related part s may be part s that are of the same system of the vehicle as the particular part or parts that are connected to the particular part. As another example the related service s may be service s that can be performed more efficiently when performed in conjunction with the potential vehicle fix than when performed individually. As yet another example the related part s may be part s in proximity to the particular part. As yet another example the related part s may be part s that are accessible for replacement without removing any other parts while accessing the particular part for replacement.

As yet another example the related part s may be part s that are accessible for replacement after removing only a minimal number of additional parts while accessing the particular part for replacement. The minimal number of parts could for example be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 or some other number of parts. The computing device can be configured to select or the vehicle repair database may specify the minimal number of parts based on an amount of time specified for removing and replacing the particular part. In accordance with at least some example embodiments the selected minimal number of parts is greater as the amount of time to remove and replace the particular part increases.

As yet another example the related part s may be part s that are accessible for replacement by performing tasks that require less than a minimal amount of time while accessing the particular part for replacement. The minimal amounts of time used by the computing device could be based on tenths of hours where each one tenth of an hour equals six minutes. The minimal amount of time could for example be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 or some other number of tenths of hours. The computing device can be configured to select or the vehicle repair database may specify the minimal number of tenths of hours based on an amount of time specified for removing and replacing the particular part. In accordance with at least some example embodiments the selected minimal number of tenths of hours is greater as the amount of time to remove and replace the particular part increases.

In one example the vehicle repair database may store information regarding parts and or services that are related to vehicle fixes. To determine parts and or services that are related to a particular vehicle fix the computing device can perform a data lookup keyed to the particular vehicle fix.

As described briefly above in some examples the computing device performing the method can determine a repair cost estimate that is specific to a particular repair shop. is a flow chart of an example method for determining repair cost information for a particular repair shop. Each block of the method can be carried out by a computing device such as the server of . As shown in at block a potential vehicle fix can be determined. Such a potential vehicle fix can be determined based on content of a vehicle repair database that matches vehicle information for a vehicle. Given the potential vehicle fix at block the computing device can determine a repair time for the potential vehicle fix. For instance the computing device can access a database of service labor time standards to determine an appropriate repair time. As an example the potential vehicle service can be Replace mass air flow sensor and the approved repair time for a service technician to replace the mass air flow sensor according to service labor time standards can be one and half hours.

Additionally at block a shop labor rate for the particular repair shop can be determined. In one example the computing device can access a user account for the particular repair shop in a user account database. The user account can indicate the shop labor rate for the particular repair shop e.g. 75 hour .

Further at block a part cost for any parts associated with the potential vehicle fix may be determined. For instance a cost of one or more parts e.g. a cost of a mass air flow sensor for a particular vehicle may be determined by querying one or more EPCs.

Subsequently at block to determine a repair cost estimate the computing device can multiply the determined repair time by the determined shop labor rate to calculate a labor cost. The labor cost may then be combined with the part cost to determine the repair cost estimate. After the repair cost estimate has been determined at block the computing device can provide the repair data cost estimate to a client computing device via a communication network.

In other examples as part of the method the computing device can determine a customized range of repair costs for a particular repair shop. is a flow chart of an example method for determining a range of repair costs. Each block of the method can be carried out by a computing device such as the server of . Initially at block the computing device can determine a potential vehicle fix. For example a vehicle fix can be determined based on vehicle information received by the computing device and content of a vehicle repair database.

At block the computing device can determine repair orders performed near a location of a particular repair shop. In one example the computing device can receive repair shop information along with a request for estimate information related to a particular vehicle or vehicle type. Based on an identity and location of the particular repair shop the computing device can identify repair orders for the potential vehicle fix that were performed at repair shops near a location of the particular repair shop. In one example the other repair shops can be repair shops that are located in the same city as the particular repair shop. In another example the other repair shops can be repair shops that are located within a predetermined range of the particular repair shop e.g. 25 miles 100 miles a zipcode range etc. .

After identifying repair orders associated with a potential vehicle fix that were performed near a particular repair shop at block the computing device can determine a range of repair costs. The computing device can determine the range of repair costs by identifying the maximum and minimum repair costs specified by the repair orders. The determined range of repair costs can then be provided to a client computing device via a communication network at block .

In still other examples as part of the method the computing device can also determine one or more future vehicle services that may need to be performed for a particular vehicle or vehicle type. is a flow of an example method for determining one or more future vehicle services. Each block of the method can be carried out by a computing device such as the server of . As shown in initially at block the computing device can determine a particular vehicle type. In one example if the vehicle information received by the computing device is a VIN the computing device can decode the VIN to determine a YMM YMME or YMMES. In other examples the vehicle information can explicitly identify a YMM YMME or YMMES.

At block the computing device can determine one or more future vehicle service s for the particular vehicle type based on repair orders for vehicles of the particular type and or recommended services that are identified by a manufacturer. The repair orders can be data that represents failure trends for vehicles. For instance the repair orders can indicate which parts of a particular vehicle type need to be repaired over time and an average mileage or range of mileage when each part is repaired.

To determine the future vehicle service s the computing device can identify repair orders matching the particular vehicle type and performed within a range of miles of the odometer reading of a vehicle. To determine the range of miles the computing device may subtract a predetermined number of miles from the mileage to determine a minimum and add a predetermined number of miles to the mileage to determine a maximum. If the odometer reading is 56 123 miles for example the range of miles can be 41 123 miles to 71 123 miles. Thus the computing device can identify repair orders for the particular vehicle type with a reported mileage of between 41 123 miles and 71 123 miles. Alternatively the computing device may identify which of a plurality of predetermined mileage ranges that the mileage corresponds to. For instance if the predetermined ranges are 0 to 25 000 miles 25 000 miles to 50 000 miles 50 000 to 75 000 miles and so on at 25 000 mile increments the computing device may determine that the mileage range is 50 000 to 75 000 miles.

At block the computing device can determine estimate information related to the one or more future vehicle services. The estimate information can include a repair time and or repair cost and can be determined in a similar manner as the determination of estimate information described above with respect to block of . Data identifying the estimate information and the future vehicle service s can also be provided to a client computing device via a communication network at block .

As discussed briefly above one or more client devices may interact with a vehicle diagnostic record when diagnosing a root cause of a vehicle malfunction and when determining estimate information for a repair. Turning now to is a block diagram of an example method for determining potential repair information. Each block of the method can be carried out by a computing device such as one of the client devices of .

As shown in at block the method includes determining by a computing device vehicle information that comprises a first vehicle identifier for a first vehicle type. In one instance the computing device can be a client device that accesses or receives a vehicle diagnostic record that indicates the vehicle information. In line with the discussion above the vehicle diagnostic record may correspond to a particular vehicle. Further the vehicle diagnostic record can include the first vehicle identifier. As one example the first vehicle identifier can be a VIN that in turn identifies the first vehicle type. Alternatively the first vehicle identifier can be a generic identifier of the first vehicle type. For instance the first vehicle identifier can be a YMM YMME or YMMES. Other types of vehicle identifiers are also possible depending on the type of vehicle.

In one embodiment a client device that is used by a service technician at a repair shop can access a vehicle diagnostic record that is maintained by a server to determine the vehicle information. By way of example a service technician can input to the client device a vehicle ID e.g. a unique identification that is assigned to a particular vehicle when a vehicle is brought in to a repair shop . Using the vehicle ID the client device can then access a vehicle diagnostic record that corresponds to the vehicle ID.

In another embodiment the client device can receive a vehicle diagnostic record from another device. For instance rather than accessing a vehicle diagnostic record stored and maintained by a server the client device can receive a copy of the vehicle diagnostic record from another client device or from a server. In this scenario the vehicle diagnostic record may again include a vehicle ID that is a unique identification assigned to a particular vehicle by a repair shop. In this manner if the client device receives multiple vehicle diagnostic records a service technician can differentiate each of the vehicle diagnostic records using the corresponding vehicle IDs.

At block the method includes determining by the computing device and based on the vehicle information at least two top repair order items in a first category of repair order items. The at least two top repair order items in the first category of repair order items are related to the first vehicle type and determined from among a plurality of repair order items in the first category of repair order items that are related to the vehicle. As one example the computing device may query a vehicle repair database through an application programming interface API or web service to determine the at least two top repair order items in the first category of repair order items.

As described above the vehicle repair database can store a plurality of repair orders that each include information pertaining to repairing a vehicle and or performing preventative maintenance. By way of example a repair order can include a combination of any of a service provider identifier a date of service identifier a customer indicator that indicates a customer seeking service of a particular vehicle vehicle information that indicates the particular vehicle a service request indicating the complaint or service requested by the customer parts information indicating parts obtained for servicing the particular vehicle and service procedure information carried out on the particular vehicle. In one embodiment repair orders can be stored in local computing systems of repair shops and can be backed up and transmitted to the vehicle repair database on a frequent basis e.g. hourly daily weekly etc. .

In one example the computing device can be configured to match the vehicle information with content of the vehicle repair database so as to identify repair orders relating to the vehicle information. In one instance the repair orders of the vehicle repair database may be tagged or annotated such that the repair orders may be filtered or sorted. For instance the vehicle repair database can include a table having records e.g. rows and fields e.g. columns that represent the repair orders. Each record of the table may correspond to a particular repair order and include data about the particular repair order. By way of example a particular repair order can be represented by a row of field values for a plurality of fields. In such an implementation the computing device can then identify a plurality of repair orders having a desired field value by filtering or sorting based on the field. The repair orders of the vehicle repair database may be tagged or annotated in other manners as well. Thus the example is not meant to be limiting. Additionally individual repair orders of the vehicle repair database may include repair order items. As with the repair orders the repair order items may also be tagged or annotated such that the repair order items can be filtered or sorted. As an example a particular repair order item may be represented in the vehicle repair database by a row of field values for a plurality of fields.

Matching the received vehicle information to repair orders of the vehicle repair database can include searching or querying the vehicle repair database to correlate the vehicle identifier with content of repair orders of the vehicle repair database. In one instance a YMM YMME or YMMES can be used to filter repair orders of the vehicle repair database. Subsequently the computing device can identify repair order items for a particular category of repair order items. For instance if the category is repaired components the computing device can identify any repaired components that are included in the repair orders related to a particular vehicle type. The computing device can then determine from among the identified repaired components the top repaired components i.e. the repaired components that occur most often in the repair orders related to the particular vehicle type . By way of example for each different type of repaired component the computing device can determine a number of repair orders corresponding to the type of repaired component.

In some instances each instance of a repaired component that corresponds to a unique part of a vehicle may be considered a different type of repaired component. Thus if the repair orders related to a particular vehicle type indicate four instances in which a water pump has been replaced the number of repair orders corresponding to the water pump may be four. Based on the respective number of repair orders corresponding to each different type of repair order the computing device can determine the at least two top repaired components. For example the computing device can rank each different type of repaired component from most number of corresponding repair orders to least number of corresponding repair orders and select the two types of repaired components having the most corresponding repair orders.

In another example the vehicle repair database may store predetermined repair information that is organized by vehicle information. To determine the potential repair information the computing device can perform a data lookup keyed to the vehicle information. For instance given a vehicle identifier of a particular vehicle type the computing device can retrieve from the vehicle repair database a list of predetermined repair information for the particular vehicle type. By way of example the predetermined repair information may identify the top repaired components for the particular vehicle type e.g. the top ten repaired components the top five repaired components etc. .

In other examples additionally or alternatively the computing device can determine other types of repair order items related to the vehicle type. For instance using the vehicle information the computing device can determine at least two of the top reported DTCs related to the vehicle type. By way of example given a plurality of repair orders corresponding to the vehicle type the computing device can identify any DTCs reported in each repair order. The computing device can then determine from among the identified repair orders the top reported DTCs. In another implementation the vehicle repair database may store predetermined repair information that is organized by vehicle information and includes the most frequently reported DTCs for each vehicle type. In this scenario given the vehicle identifier the computing device can retrieve from the vehicle repair database a list of the top reported DTCs for the vehicle type.

As another example using the vehicle information the computing device can determine at least two of the top reported symptoms related to the vehicle type. By way of example given a plurality of repair orders corresponding to the vehicle type the computing device can identify any symptoms reported in each repair order. The computing device can then determine from among the identified repair orders the top reported symptoms. In another implementation the vehicle repair database may store predetermined repair information that is organized by vehicle information and includes the top reported symptoms for each vehicle type. In this scenario given the vehicle identifier the computing device can retrieve from the vehicle repair database a list of the top reported symptoms for the vehicle type.

As another example using the vehicle information the computing device can determine any technical service bulletins TSBs related to the vehicle type. By way of example the vehicle repair database or a separate database may store TSBs organized by one or more vehicle identifiers that correspond to each TSB. Given a particular vehicle identifier the computing device can then query the vehicle repair database or other database to retrieve any TSBs related to the vehicle type.

At block the method includes providing by the computing device and for display a graphical representation of the at least two top repair order items in the first category of repair order items. By way of example the graphical representation may be any type of chart or graph. For instance the chart or graph may identify the number of times that each of the top repair order items occurs. Alternatively the chart or graph may identify a percentage of all of the repair order items related to the vehicle type that correspond to each particular repair order item or perhaps a percentage of all of the at least two top repair order items that correspond to each particular repair order item. For instance if the computing device provides a pie graph that is indicative of the five top repaired components each pie slice of the graph may correspond to a particular repaired component and the size of each pie slice may be proportional to the relative number of times each component is repaired. In other words if the computing device identified the top five repaired components and the top repaired component of the top five corresponds to twice as many repair orders as the second most frequently repaired component the pie slice corresponding to the top repaired component may be twice the size of the pie slice corresponding to the second most frequently repaired component.

In some examples the at least two top repair order items in the first category may be provided in an alternative manner was well. For instance the computing device may provide a list of the at least two top repair order items in the first category or multiple lists of at least two top repair order items in multiple respective categories.

In other examples instead of or in addition to providing a graphical representation of the at least two top repaired components the computing device can provide a list or graphical representation of the at least two top reported DTCs and or symptoms related to the vehicle type. For instance the computing device can provide a list of 3 4 5 10 or more of the top reported DTCs and or symptoms related to the vehicle type. Within the list the DTCs and or symptoms may be sorted by frequency of occurrence. Alternatively the list may be sorted alphabetically. Optionally the computing device can also provide a list of any TSBs related to the vehicle type.

In another example rather than providing a graphical representation of the at least two top repaired components the computing device can provide for display a list of the at least two top repaired components and provide for display a graphical representation of one or both of the at least two top reported DTCs and the at least two top reported symptoms.

In further examples the method can also include determining and providing a vehicle usage profile for a particular repaired component a particular DTC and or a particular symptom. For instance in response to receiving a selection of a particular repaired component DTC or symptom the computing device can determine a vehicle usage profile corresponding to the selection and provide the vehicle usage profile for display.

In one example the vehicle usage profile for the particular repaired component particular DTC and or particular symptom may be indicative of a distribution of a plurality of repair orders over a plurality of vehicle usage intervals. In particular the plurality of repair orders may correspond to the particular vehicle type as identified by the vehicle information and the particular repaired component particular DTC or particular symptom. For instance the vehicle usage profile may be a histogram or similar type of graphical representation of the distribution.

In line with the discussion above to determine the vehicle usage profile the computing device can identify vehicle usage data for the plurality of repair orders that correspond to the particular vehicle type and the particular repaired component particular DTC or particular symptom. For instance a vehicle usage profile for a Water Pump Remove and Replace may be determined by identifying all repair orders of the vehicle repair database that involved repairing the water pump on a particular vehicle type. The computing device can then sort the identified repair orders into vehicle usage intervals e.g. bins based on reported odometer readings and provide a graphical representation of the distribution of repair orders over the plurality of vehicle usage intervals.

In one instance the customer information and vehicle information may be input manually using an input interface of the client device. Alternatively the customer information and vehicle information may be retrieved from a database of customer information using a customer s name. As still another example the customer information and vehicle information can be retrieved by scanning a physical identifier e.g. a bar code or other identification code that is located on or within a vehicle or a vehicle s key.

As shown in in one example the interface may be a pattern failure traveler that provides potential repair information for a vehicle. In particular the pattern failure traveler may include a graphical representation of top repaired components a list of top reported DTCs and a list of top reported symptoms.

The graphical representation of top repaired components includes a donut graph of the top five repaired components related to a particular vehicle type. For instance the graphical representation identifies a brake caliper oxygen sensor anti lock brake wheel speed sensor ignition coil and water pump. In one example the relative size of each portion of the donut graph may be indicative of the relative number of repair orders that relate to the vehicle type and relate to a repaired component represented by the portion. In other words according to the example in the brake caliper may be the top repaired component while the water pump may be the fifth most frequently repaired component.

The list of top reported DTCs includes a list of the five top reported DTCs related to the particular vehicle. In one example the list may be ordered based on frequency of occurrence. Thus P0100 may be the DTC that was reported the most number of times within all of the repair orders related to the particular vehicle type.

The list of top reported symptoms includes a list of the five top reported symptoms related to the particular vehicle. In one example the list may be ordered based on frequency of occurrence. Thus Hear Rattle may be the symptom that was reported the most number of times within all of the repair orders related to the particular vehicle.

In one embodiment a service technician may use the interface to facilitate diagnosing a vehicle. For instance the service technician may view a vehicle usage profile that is indicative of when a particular component is often repaired for the particular vehicle type by clicking on hovering over or otherwise selecting the particular component. As shown in if a computing device receives data indicating a selection of the brake caliper component the computing device may provide a vehicle usage profile A for the brake caliper. By way of example the vehicle usage profile A includes a histogram having a plurality of bins corresponding to a plurality of mileage intervals. In the example of each mileage interval represents a range of 10 000 miles. For instance a first interval is 0 10 000 miles a second interval is 10 001 20 000 miles a third interval is 20 001 30 000 miles etc. Looking at the vehicle usage profile A may provide the service technician with an estimate of whether or not a brake caliper is likely to need repaired given the mileage of the particular vehicle the technician is diagnosing. For instance if the particular vehicle has over 60 000 miles in light of the vehicle usage profile A the service technician may wish to check whether the brake calipers need to be replaced.

Similarly a service technician may view a vehicle usage profile that is indicative of when a particular DTC is reported for the particular vehicle type by selecting a particular DTC. As shown in if a computing devices receives data indicating a selection of the P0100 Mass Air Flow Sensor DTC the computing device may provide a vehicle usage profile B for the particular DTC. By way of example the vehicle usage profile B includes a histogram having a plurality of bins corresponding to a plurality of mileage intervals. Looking at the vehicle usage profile B may provide the service technician with an estimate of when over the usage of a vehicle the particular DTC is reported for the particular vehicle type.

Likewise a service technician may view a vehicle usage profile that is indicative of when a particular symptom is reported for the particular vehicle type by selecting a particular symptom. As shown in if a computing devices receives data indicating a selection of the Hear Squeal symptom the computing device may provide a vehicle usage profile C for the particular symptom. By way of example the vehicle usage profile C includes a histogram having a plurality of bins corresponding to a plurality of mileage intervals. Looking at the vehicle usage profile C may provide the service technician with an estimate of when over the usage of a vehicle the particular symptom is reported for the particular vehicle type.

Additionally in line with the discussion above a service technician may use the interface to select one or more potential vehicle fixes for a vehicle. For example as shown in if the service technician verifies that one or multiple brake calipers need to be replaced e.g. by visually inspecting and testing the vehicle s braking systems the service technician may select a check box next to the brake caliper on the interface . In response to receiving a selection of the brake caliper the computing device can provide a list A of one or more potential vehicle fixes related to the brake caliper. The service technician may then select one or more vehicle fixes from the list A and the computing device can associate the selected vehicle fix es with the vehicle diagnostic record. For instance in response to selecting the Transfer button the computing device can associate the selected vehicle fix es with the vehicle diagnostic record. In another example the list A may be provided in a pop up window that overlays a portion of the pattern failure traveler not shown .

Similarly as shown in if the service technician verifies that a particular DTC is triggered for the particular vehicle the service technician may select a check box next to the particular DTC on the interface . In response to receiving a selection of the DTC the computing device can provide a list B of one or more potential vehicle fixes related to the DTC. The service technician may then select one or more vehicle fixes from the list B and the computing device can associate the selected vehicle fix es with the vehicle diagnostic record in response to a selection of the Transfer button . In another example the list B may be provided in a pop up window that overlays a portion of the pattern failure traveler not shown .

Likewise as shown in if the service technician verifies that a vehicle is exhibiting a particular symptom the service technician may select a check box next to the particular symptom on the interface . In response to receiving a selection of the symptom the computing device can provide a list C of one or more potential vehicle fixes related to the symptom. The service technician may then select one or more vehicle fixes from the list C and the computing device can associate the selected vehicle fix es with the vehicle diagnostic record in response to a selection of the Transfer button . In another example the list C may be provided in a pop up window that overlays a portion of the pattern failure traveler not shown .

Further in line with the discussion above a server or other computing device can determine estimate information related to at least one potential vehicle fix that is associated with a vehicle diagnostic record. For example as described above with respect to the computing device can determine a repair time for the potential vehicle fix by accessing a database of service labor time standards. And the computing device can determine a shop labor rate for a particular repair shop by accessing a user account for the particular repair shop. Further the computing device can determine a part cost for any parts associated with the potential vehicle fix by querying one or more EPCs. And to determine to determine a repair cost estimate the computing device can multiply the determined repair time by the determined shop labor rate to calculate a labor cost. The labor cost may then be combined with the part cost to determine the repair cost estimate.

After the repair cost estimate or repair time estimate have been determined the computing device can associate the repair cost estimate or the repair time estimate with the vehicle diagnostic record. For example the computing device may update the vehicle diagnostic record maintained by the server to include the repair cost estimate and the repair time estimate.

As shown in the interface includes a list of top repaired components a list of top repaired DTCs a list of top repaired symptoms and a list of top lookups . In one instance the list of top lookups may include a list of components that users e.g. service technicians most often search for a particular vehicle type.

Additionally depicts a search box . In some examples a user may use the search box to search for a particular symptom component or DTC that does not appear in the list of top repaired components list of top repaired DTCs list of top repaired symptoms and list of top lookups . In some instances a user may enter text into the search box and results of a search may be provided in a display window . For instance if a user enters a particular component the results may include a vehicle usage profile related to the particular component. Other examples are also possible.

Note that in the example interface of the search box is provided near a top of the interface . The example is not meant to be limiting. In other configurations the search box may be provided in other locations of the interface as well.

Referring now to are example flow diagrams for interacting with a vehicle diagnostic record. In particular illustrate example interactions between a first client device a server a second client device and a vehicle repair database . For purposes of example with respect to it is assumed the first client device is operated by a service writer and the second client device is operated by a service technician. In other examples one or more functions of the first client device and the second client device can be performed by a single client device. Alternatively in some instances one or more functions of the first client device and the second client device can be performed by one or more additional computing devices not shown .

As shown in at block the first client device can receive vehicle information. For instance the first client device may receive vehicle information that is input by a service writer or scanned from a vehicle. The first client device can then at block associate the vehicle information with a vehicle diagnostic record that is maintained by the server . For instance the first client device can use a web service or an application programming interface to create a vehicle diagnostic record. Alternatively the first client device can associate the vehicle information with a vehicle diagnostic record by generating a vehicle diagnostic record having the vehicle information not shown .

Subsequently at block the second client device can access the vehicle diagnostic record to determine vehicle information for a particular vehicle type that a service technician is diagnosing. After determining the vehicle information at block the second client device can query the vehicle repair database to determine repair information related to the particular vehicle type. In line with the discussion above the second client device can determine one or any combination of at least two of the top repaired components related to the vehicle type at least two of the top reported symptoms related to the vehicle type and at least two of the top reported DTCs related to the vehicle type. And at block the second client device can provide a graphical representation that is indicative of the repair information. For instance the graphical representation may be a graph or chart that is indicative of a portion of the repair information.

As shown in at block the second client device can receive a selection of a potential vehicle fix. At block the second client device can associate the vehicle fix with the vehicle diagnostic record. Further at block the server can query the vehicle repair database to determine estimate information related to the vehicle fix. In line with the discussion above the estimate information may include a repair cost estimate and or a repair time estimate. At block the server can then associate the determined estimate information with the vehicle diagnostic record.

Subsequently at blocks and the first client device can access the vehicle diagnostic record to determine the estimate information and display the estimate information. For instance a service writer can access the vehicle diagnostic record in order to prepare a quote for a customer. Thus the first client device and the second client device can access the vehicle diagnostic record when interacting with a customer and diagnosing a cause of a vehicle malfunction.
