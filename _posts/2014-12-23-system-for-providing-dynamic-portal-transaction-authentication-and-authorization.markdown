This application is a continuation of co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 298 015 entitled System and Method for Providing Dynamic Insurance Portal Transaction Authentication and Authorization filed Nov. 16 2011 the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.

In general the invention relates to systems and methods for computerized user self registration authentication and authorization for access to a number of computerized services offered by an insurance company.

Insurance companies provide a range of services to their customers. For example an insurance company may offer workers compensation insurance property insurance life insurance vehicle insurance and or business insurance services to their customers. Further insurance companies often offer related services for example mutual fund annuity college savings plan and or retirement plan services. Customers access and interact with these insurance services by accessing Internet websites and or other electronic network resources maintained by the insurance company. For example a user may change a level of coverage deposit or withdraw funds and or change beneficiary information for a given insurance service using a website maintained by the insurance company for that service.

An insurance company may maintain substantial network resources e.g. servers databases and information repositories to provide customers with electronic access to these insurance services. However the resources for different insurance services are typically located on different computing systems that may additionally operate on different information platforms. As a result there is typically little or no information exchange among the individual computerized insurance services offered by an insurance company. The fragmented and disparate structure of typical insurance networks creates many inconveniences for insurance companies and their customers.

Typically a customer s interactions with the insurance company are fragmented. For example a user s online preferences and settings e.g. with respect to a preferred mailing addresses mode of contact beneficiaries and or bank account information enacted through one computerized insurance service are not readily available when the user uses another computerized insurance service of the same insurance company. Similarly a user may be required to register separately for each insurance service and reenter his or her online preferences and settings for each service. The lack of a global profile management framework across all of the computerized insurance services offered by an insurance company inconveniences both the insurance company and its customers.

Further it is difficult for the insurance company to maintain security across all of its insurance services. For example actions that are indicative of fraud or trusted behavior with respect to a user s interactions with one computerized insurance service are not automatically shared with the other computerized insurance services offered by the company. For example a user may act to increase security with respect to one of the computerized insurance services e.g. by creating highly secure login credentials in a manner that is not recognized by the other computerized insurance services. Similarly activities that are indicative of fraud e.g. multiple failed login attempts or access from a suspect IP address that occur in relation to one computerized insurance service may not be recognized by the other computerized insurance services offered by the company. The lack of a global security framework for registration authentication and authorization across all of the computerized insurance services offered by an insurance company inconveniences both the insurance company and its customers.

Therefore there is a need for systems and methods to integrate the substantial networking and computing resources used by an insurance company to provide the range of insurance services described above. Specifically there is a need to integrate security information and user profile information so that pertinent data is shared between all the insurance services in an automated timely and minimally intrusive manner. Further there is a need to dynamically and globally update security information and user profile information based on user and non user interactions that occur with respect to individual insurance services. By integrating networking and computing resources for the range of insurance services an insurance company may provide more secure and accurate self registration of a user of an insurance system more secure and accurate authentication and authorization of user requested activities with the insurance system and a simpler and more flexible interface from which a user can select preferences and other settings for the user s interactions with the insurance system.

Accordingly systems and methods are disclosed herein for managing electronic access to a plurality of computerized insurance services. The system includes a processor a network interface and a memory. The network interface is configured to receive a user identity provided by a user remote to the system and an access request from the user to access a selected computerized insurance service from the plurality of computerized insurance services. The memory stores computer executable instructions which when executed by the processor cause the system to determine a set of access rights for the user based on the user identity and an insurance related role associated with the user identity as related to the selected computerized insurance service. The computer executable instructions when executed by the processor further cause the system to allow the user to access the selected computerized insurance service according to the access request only if the access requested is included in the determined set of access rights. At least two of the computerized insurance services are implemented on substantially different information platforms.

In some embodiments the network interface is further configured to receive a user request to change the insurance related role associated with the user identity from a first role to a second role. Further in some embodiments the first role and the second role are each selected from a personal role a claimant role a beneficiary role an agent role and a business role. In some embodiments a plurality of insurance related roles are associated with the user identity and the network interface is further configured to receive a first request from the user to select a document delivery preference for documents of the selected computerized insurance service that are associated with a first of the plurality of insurance related roles and a second request from the user to select a document delivery preference for documents of the selected computerized insurance service that are associated with a second of the plurality of insurance related roles. In some embodiments a document delivery preference is selected from e mail delivery paper delivery and fax delivery. Further in some embodiments the plurality of computerized insurance services comprises at least one non property insurance service selected from a 401 k retirement service and an annuity investment service.

In some embodiments the computer executable instructions when executed by the processor further cause the processor to include an access right in the set of access rights only if an authentication score associated with the user identity is greater than a threshold value. Additionally in some embodiments the set of access rights is determined based on the selected computerized insurance service. Further in some embodiments the set of access rights includes a right to withdraw funds associated with the selected computerized insurance service and a right to modify beneficiary information associated with the selected computerized insurance service.

In some embodiments the computer executable instructions when executed by the processor further cause the processor to determine the threshold value based on the selected computerized insurance service. Additionally in some embodiments the memory separately stores a threshold value for each of the plurality of computerized insurance services and retrieves the threshold value corresponding to the selected computerized insurance service. Further in some embodiments the threshold value is based on a device type from which the user identity was received and the device type is one of a stationary computing device located in a private location a stationary computing device located in a public area and a handheld wireless mobile device.

In some embodiments the computer executable instructions when executed by the processor further cause the processor to determine the authentication score by determining a base component and a dynamic component of the authentication score where the base component is retrieved from the memory and represents activities associated with the user identity prior to receiving the access request and the dynamic component represents activities associated with the user identity including and after receiving the access request. Still further in some embodiments the base component is determined based at least in part on one or more secure information items provided during a first time registration of the user identity. Further in some embodiments the base component is determined based at least in part on a history of successful or unsuccessful login attempts associated with the user identity. Additionally in some embodiments the dynamic component is determined based on a device type from which the access request was received. In some embodiments the dynamic component is automatically updated during a user activity session based on at least one non user action that occurs during the activity session.

In some embodiments the computer executable instructions when executed by the processor further cause the processor to prompt the user to provide information related to one or more previously established security credentials if the access requested is not included in the set of access rights. Further in some embodiments the computer executable instructions when executed by the processor further cause the processor to prompt the user to provide information for one or more secure information items if the access requested is not included in the set of access rights update the authentication score in response to the user provided one or more secure information items and update the set of access rights based at least in part on the updated authentication score. Additionally in some embodiments the computer executable instructions when executed by the processor further cause the processor to prior to prompting a user to provide information for one or more secure information items inform the user that the access requested is not allowed and prompt the user the select a security credential type from a plurality of security credentials types that can be used to increase the authentication score.

Further systems and methods are disclosed herein for managing user information related to a plurality of computerized insurance services. The system includes a processor a database a network interface and a memory. The database stores user information for the plurality of computerized insurance services. The information stored in the database includes a plurality of user identities and for each user identity in the plurality of user identities an indication of which of the plurality of computerized insurance services the user identity is registered for. The information stored in the database further includes for a user identity in the plurality of user identities and a computerized insurance service for which the user identity is registered a plurality of insurance related roles associated with the user identity in relation to the computerized insurance service. The network interface is configured to receive a user identity and a request related to a selected one of the computerized insurance services provided by a user remote to the system. The memory stores computer executable instructions which when executed by the processor cause the system to determine an insurance related role for the received user identity identify a storage location in the database corresponding to the received user identity the selected computerized information service and the determined insurance related role retrieve from the identified storage location a first authentication score calculate a second authentication score based at least in part on user activity with the selected computerized insurance service in relation to the received request and store in the identified storage location the second authentication score in place of the first authentication score.

In some embodiments the determined insurance related role is selected from a personal role a claimant role a beneficiary role an agent role and a business role. Further in some embodiments the information stored in the database further comprises a plurality of document delivery preferences for a corresponding plurality of insurance related roles for a given user identity wherein at least one of the document delivery preferences is selected from e mail delivery paper delivery and fax delivery. Additionally in some embodiments the computer executable instructions when executed by the processor further cause the processor to in response to the storing of the second authentication score in place of the first authentication score automatically store the second authentication score in another storage location of the database that corresponds to the received user identity the determined insurance related role and a computerized insurance service other than the selected computerized insurance service.

To provide an overall understanding of the invention certain illustrative embodiments will now be described including systems and methods for computerized user self registration authentication and authorization for access to a number of computerized services offered by an insurance company. However it will be understood by one of ordinary skill that the systems and methods described herein may be adapted and modified as is appropriate for the application being addressed and that the systems and methods described herein may be employed in other suitable applications and that such other additions and modifications will not depart from the scope thereof.

The disclosure that follows describes inter alia techniques for granting access to secure features of computerized insurance services based on a set of user access rights. In particular the disclosure relates to systems and methods for determining access rights for a user based on the user s previously established security credentials and temporary and permanent authentication step up procedures. The user s set of access rights may change over time due to user interactions with the computerized insurance services and due to non user events.

The front end computing system is an intermediary between customers of the insurance company and the computerized insurance services . The computerized insurance services represents a plurality of separately maintained electronic insurance services. At least some of the individual services of the computerized insurance services are maintained on separate computing systems e.g. servers databases and information repositories that operate on different and generally incompatible information platforms. Further the various computerized insurance services of the computerized insurance services may be located in the same information center e.g. data processing facility or may be spread out across multiple geographically separate information centers.

The computerized insurance services may include for example and without limitation some or all of health insurance fire insurance life insurance vehicle insurance business insurance mutual fund annuity college savings plan and retirement plan services. Despite the fragmented nature of the individual insurance services included in the computerized insurance services the integrated insurance system provides a single integrated experience to customers of the insurance company by logically treating the computerized insurance services as back end services and arbitrating access to the back end services using the front end computing system .

To do so the front end computing system allows customers of the insurance company to securely self register for a single global network account i.e. user identity . The front end computing system then monitors and governs the user s subsequent access to each of computerized insurance services for which the user has access rights. In some embodiments new customers are required to self register for this global user identity in place of creating specific accounts for the individual computerized insurance services . In some embodiments users having existing legacy accounts for some or all of the computerized insurance services are requested or required to merge those accounts into a new global account based on a global user identity. In some embodiments the computerized insurance services includes at least one insurance service that is implemented on a legacy information platform that is directly accessible by entering a corresponding Internet address into a web browser and at least one insurance service that is accessible only through a global portal available to those who have registered for a global user identity.

Once registered for a global account customers may manage security and profile preferences and settings through a single global user interface provided by the integrated insurance system . Changes made through the global interface are automatically effective for each of the other computerized insurance services of the computerized insurance services so that preferences and settings are uniform across all of the computerized insurance services used by a given customer.

Further the front end computing system manages self registration authentication and authorization functions across all of the computerized insurance services . The front end computing system also maintains global information on user profiles e.g. with respect to a preferred mailing addresses mode of contact beneficiaries and or bank account information and roles associated with the user profiles.

The front end computing system also monitors and detects actions that are indicative of fraud or trusted behavior that occur in relation to a user s identity with one of the computerized insurance services and applies this information globally to the other computerized insurance services. For example a user may take action to increase his security level with respective to one computerized insurance service e.g. by providing a biometric identifier or creating highly secure login credentials . As another example events may occur that are indicative of fraud e.g. repeated failed login attempts or access from a new IP address with respect to one of the computerized insurance services . In both cases the front end computing system collects this information and applies it globally to modify a temporary and or longer term trust level associated with the user identity i.e. in the form of an authentication score as will be described subsequently . The front end computing service may automatically query the individual computerized insurance services to collect this information. Additionally or alternatively the individual computerized insurance services may automatically without being queried send data to the front end computing system to provide this information.

To perform these and other functions the front end computing system includes a plurality of integrated system servers a network interface an insurance company database a processing unit and company terminals . The front end computing system is also communicatively coupled to an internal information repository . These computing devices are connected by the local area network .

The network interface is responsible for receiving user access requests related to the computerized insurance services and distributing the requests among the integrated system servers . The integrated system servers receive data from the network interface and manage the data to provide integrative functionality as described above. To do so the integrated system servers execute computer executable instructions for a user profile module a security module and a portal module using one or more processors as will be further described subsequently.

The insurance company database stores information related to registered users of the front end computing system . For each user identity registered with the front end computing system the database may store for example and without limitation security information including an authentication score for each of a plurality of roles associated with the user identity security credentials previously established for the user identity and historical interactions of the user identity with the front end computing system and the computerized insurance services . Further for each user identity registered with the front end computing system the database may store for example and without limitation user profile information including document delivery preferences contact preferences beneficiary information and policy information for the user identity. Further details on the implementation of the database in accordance with some embodiments are further discussed in relation to . In some embodiments the database is not located within the front end computing system but instead is communicatively connected to the front end computing system via the communications network . In this case appropriate security controls e.g. secure http connections are used to ensure that data stored in the database is not retrieved or otherwise obtained by unintended parties.

The processing unit executes computer executable instructions to support the user self registration authentication and authorization functions of the front end computing system . The processing unit includes one or more processors. For example the processing unit may include an authentication score processor for determining and updating an authentication score associated with a given user identity and role from data obtained from the database the integrated system servers and or from an internal information repository . The processing unit also includes an access rights processor that determines access rights e.g. read and write access rights for a user identity to a given one of the computerized insurance services based on among other things an authentication score . An exemplary implementation of a computing device for use in the front end computing system is discussed in greater detail in relation to .

The company terminals allow insurance company employees to interact with the integrated insurance system through various user interfaces displayed on the company terminals . The interfaces include for example and without limitation interfaces to review and manually adjust user profile data security data historical user transaction data and to retrieve data related to insurance policies. The interfaces may be integrated into one or more websites for managing the integrated insurance system or they may be integrated into thin or thick software clients or stand alone software. The company terminals can be any computing devices suitable for carrying out the processes described above including personal computers laptop computers tablet computers smartphones servers and other computing devices. In some embodiments different insurance company employees may be given different access privileges. For example marketing employees may only be able to retrieve information on insurance policies but not to make any changes to insurance policy data.

The front end computing system may obtain information from one or more public or private databases in order to perform self registration authentication authorization and other related functions. For example the front end computing system may compare data provided by a user during a self registration process to information available from public or private record databases e.g. driving records tax records criminal records and financial records . Similarly the front end computing system may connect to one or more public or private databases to generate challenge questions or access remotely generated security credentials such as RSA or Captcha credentials.

In the illustration of the front end computing system is connected to private database i.e. the internal information repository that is maintained by the insurance company. The internal information repository may store past insurance claim information for a user of the integrated insurance system and some of this information may be used to establish one or more security credentials for the user. As further illustrated in the front end computing system is also connected to external databases . The external databases generally include both public and private e.g. subscription based databases. The physical locations of the individual databases of the external databases may span a wide geographic area.

User computing devices and provide various user interfaces for customers to interact with the integrated insurance system over the communications network . Current and potential customers interact with the user computing devices and to access the features of the computerized insurance services . For example a user may use the user computing device to view and or modify information related to a life insurance policy register for new insurance services or merge existing legacy insurance accounts. A user may use user computing device to authenticate themselves to the integrated insurance system either on a temporary or permanent basis or to perform any other suitable insurance function as described in the disclosure herein.

The data exchange between the front end computing system and the other computing devices and systems in can occur using push and pull technologies where the integrated system servers of the integrated insurance system can act as both a server and client. In some embodiments the integrated system servers can request to receive periodic data feeds from the computerized insurance services company terminals the internal information repository and or user computing devices and . The communication between the integrated system servers and the other computing devices and system in can follow various known communication protocols such as TCP IP cellular protocols including GSM Wi Fi Wi Max or other wireless communications technologies or combination of wired or wireless channels.

In general data exchanges between the front end computing system and the individual computerized insurance services of the computerized insurance services may be initiated by either the front end computing system or the individual computerized insurance services. Further in cases where the front end computing system uses a different instruction set compared to the computerized insurance service to which it is communicating instructions may be translated by the transmitting party i.e. either of the front end computing system or the computerized insurance service into a format easily interpretable by the receiving party. For example instructions may be translated using an application programming interface API .

The computing device may be configured in a distributed architecture where databases and processors are housed in separate units or locations. The computing device may also be implemented as a server located either on site at an insurance company or external to the insurance company. Some such units perform primary processing functions and contain at a minimum a general controller or a processor and a system memory . In such an embodiment each of these units is attached via the network interface unit to a communications hub or port not shown that serves as a primary communication link with other servers client or user computers and other related devices. The communications hub or port may have minimal processing capability itself serving primarily as a communications router. A variety of communications protocols may be part of the system including but not limited to Ethernet SAP SAS ATP BLUETOOTH GSM and TCP IP.

The CPU comprises a processor such as one or more conventional microprocessors and one or more supplementary co processors such as math co processors for offloading workload from the CPU . The CPU is in communication with the network interface unit and the input output controller through which the CPU communicates with other devices such as other servers user terminals or devices. The network interface unit and or the input output controller may include multiple communication channels for simultaneous communication with for example other processors servers or client terminals. Devices in communication with each other need not be continually transmitting to each other. On the contrary such devices need only transmit to each other as necessary may actually refrain from exchanging data most of the time and may require several steps to be performed to establish a communication link between the devices.

The CPU is also in communication with the data storage device . The data storage device may comprise an appropriate combination of magnetic optical and or semiconductor memory and may include for example RAM ROM flash drive an optical disc such as a compact disc and or a hard disk or drive. The CPU and the data storage device each may be for example located entirely within a single computer or other computing device or connected to each other by a communication medium such as a USB port serial port cable a coaxial cable an Ethernet type cable a telephone line a radio frequency transceiver or other similar wireless or wired medium or combination of the foregoing. For example the CPU may be connected to the data storage device via the network interface unit .

The CPU may be configured to perform one or more particular processing functions. For example the computing device may be configured for calculating an authentication score associated with a user identity and role. The same computing device or another similar computing device may be configured for comparing an authentication score to a threshold authentication value. The same computing device or another similar computing device may be configured for self registering a user for a global user identity on the front end computing system .

The data storage device may store for example i an operating system for the computing device ii one or more applications e.g. computer program code and or a computer program product adapted to direct the CPU in accordance with the present invention and particularly in accordance with the processes described in detail with regard to the CPU and or iii database s adapted to store information that may be utilized to store information required by the program. The database s may include all or a subset of data stored in insurance company database as well as additional data such as formulas or manual adjustments.

The operating system and or applications may be stored for example in a compressed an uncompiled and or an encrypted format and may include computer program code. The instructions of the program may be read into a main memory of the processor from a computer readable medium other than the data storage device such as from the ROM or from the RAM . While execution of sequences of instructions in the program causes the CPU to perform the process steps described herein hard wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions for implementation of the processes of the present invention.

The term computer readable medium as used herein refers to any non transitory medium that provides or participates in providing instructions to the processor of the computing device or any other processor of a device described herein for execution. Such a medium may take many forms including but not limited to non volatile media and volatile media. Non volatile media include for example optical magnetic or opto magnetic disks or integrated circuit memory such as flash memory. Volatile media include dynamic random access memory DRAM which typically constitutes the main memory. Common forms of computer readable media include for example a floppy disk a flexible disk hard disk magnetic tape any other magnetic medium a CD ROM DVD any other optical medium punch cards paper tape any other physical medium with patterns of holes a RAM a PROM an EPROM or EEPROM electronically erasable programmable read only memory a FLASH EEPROM any other memory chip or cartridge or any other non transitory medium from which a computer can read.

Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to the CPU or any other processor of a device described herein for execution. For example the instructions may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer not shown . The remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over an Ethernet connection cable line or even telephone line using a modem. A communications device local to a computing device e.g. a server can receive the data on the respective communications line and place the data on a system bus for the processor. The system bus carries the data to main memory from which the processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory may optionally be stored in memory either before or after execution by the processor. In addition instructions may be received via a communication port as electrical electromagnetic or optical signals which are exemplary forms of wireless communications or data streams that carry various types of information.

In some embodiments a user must supply one or more previously established security credentials to access personal information from the graphical user interface . Specifically a user accesses the graphical user interface by entering a website address into address bar of a web browser to be presented with a generic version of the graphical user interface that includes box but not any personal information. A personalized version of the graphical user interface is displayed after the user provides a user identity and correctly supplies one or more security credentials.

In some embodiments a user enters a username and password to login as illustrated by dialog box of . In some embodiments a user may enter a user name and then be presented with the option to enter some or all of a set of previously established security credentials which may include a password to login. In some embodiments the front end computing system selects a subset of previously established security credentials and queries the user to enter information related to the selected security credentials. For example a user may login by entering a user identity and an access code obtained from a RSA dongle provided to the user by the insurance company per a previously completed self registration process. A user s subsequent access to particular features of the integrated insurance system may be limited or restricted based on the method used to login as well as on a stored authentication score of the user as will be explained in the subsequent disclosure.

The graphical user interface provides a single integrated insurance portal that a user may use to access any of the computerized insurance services . However in some embodiments a user may login directly to an individual one of the computerized insurance services e.g. through a legacy Internet address and be redirected either automatically or after agreement to the graphical user interface . Once redirected the user may be prompted to enter login credentials in box or convert existing login credentials for the individual one of the computerized insurance services into a global user identity. This would be the case if an insurance company is gradually transitioning from a network architecture in which users directly access each of the computerized insurance services to a system where access to computerized insurance service is arbitrated through a global portal module. A user may navigate to other websites using drop down menu . For example a user may connect directly to a website for one of the computerized insurance services by selecting the service from the drop down menu . In some embodiments once a user identity is accepted by the graphical user interface a user can access multiple computerized insurance services from the computerized insurance services without being required to login again.

In some embodiments an user s historical i.e. legacy accounts with some or all of the computerized insurance services are not fully compliant with a global user identity requirement and so existing users of the integrated insurance system are required to undergo a self registration process for a global user identity. A prospective or current customer who has not yet successfully registered for a global user identity for the integrated insurance system can initiate a first time self registration process by selecting link . A user who has forgotten their username or login credentials can select link to initiate a process to recover the missing information.

Display area provides a unified view of insurance products associated with a given customer. For example in the example of a customer Joel has an auto policy business policy and at least one wealth management account e.g. a mutual fund investment account a 401 k retirement account and or an annuity investment account with the Hartford insurance company and links to these services are provided in the display area . As will be explained further in this disclosure the services displayed in display area may depend not just on a user identity used to login but also on a currently active role for the user identity. For example the insurance services displayed in display area may vary depending on whether a user logs in a customer employee or beneficiary role. Although the display area is pre populated with only some insurance services a user may access a wider range of the computerized insurance services using menu . For example a user may access services from the computerized insurance services organized by home life business benefits and investments categories.

In addition to accessing individual computerized insurance services from graphical user interface a user may also access a My Profile portion of the graphical user interface by selecting link to display panel . From the display panel a user may modify contact preferences role information opt in or out of various services change language preferences and perform a variety of other tasks which are described elsewhere in this disclosure. A user may also edit security settings from the display panel . For example a user may perform procedures to temporarily or permanently step up an authentication score so as to increase access rights for additional features of some or all of the computerized insurance services . In some embodiments a user may set one or more security questions as depicted in the display panel .

In some embodiments a user may set contact preferences directly from the display panel . For example the display panel shows that contact information may be set for each of four different tabs. The four tabs may correspond to different roles that Joel uses to access the front end computing system . For example the tab labeled one may correspond to a customer role the tab labeled two may correspond to a business role the tab labeled three may correspond to a beneficiary role and the tab labeled four may correspond to a claimant role. Thus Joel enters default contact information for each of these roles using the corresponding tab in the display panel . In some embodiments the tabs index computerized insurances services rather than roles. Suppose Joel is registered for three computerized insurance services auto insurance business insurance and mutual funds as illustrated in . Then in some embodiments only three tabs are displayed in the Contact section of the display panel and Joel enters default contact information for each of these three computerized insurance services using the corresponding tab.

In some embodiments an access request to modify information via the My Profile utility is permitted only if an authentication score associated with a currently active user identity and role exceeds a threshold value retrieved from the security module. Similarly a user request to change the active role for a user identity may only be permitted if the authentication score associated with a currently active user identity and role exceeds a threshold value which may depend on the current and or desired role that is retrieved from the security module described in relation to . If these conditions are not satisfied the user may be prompted to permanently or temporarily increase the authentication score according to techniques described elsewhere in this disclosure.

The information provided in the graphical user interface may be obtained by querying the individual computerized insurance services . For example the front end computing service may automatically query the individual computerized insurance services to collect this information. Additionally or alternatively the individual computerized insurance services may send data to the front end computing system that provides this information without being queried. Further the individual computerized insurance services may send instructions to directly display information on the graphical user interface or the front end computing system may generate these instructions from more general data received from the computerized insurance services. Instructions may be translated between the individual computerized insurance services and the front end computing system using an API.

A user of the front end computing system selects a role from role selection panel to customize document delivery preferences for that role. In the illustrated example Joel has established personal beneficiary business and claimant roles with the front end computing system . Thus the role selection panel is pre populated with each of these roles. As illustrated Joel has selected to set and or modify document delivery preferences associated with his personal role and hence the radio button for this role is selected i.e. filled in in the role selection panel . Alternatively Joel s personal role may be preselected without direct input from Joel if this was Joel s active role when Joel last accessed the graphical user interface .

In the illustrative example of Joel s personal role is associated with four of the computerized insurance services i.e. an auto insurance service a retirement 401 k service a mutual fund service and an annuity investment service. The front end computing system automatically organizes the retirement 401 k service the mutual fund service and the annuity investment service under the title of wealth management in display area . Alternatively in some embodiments one of the computerized insurance services is a general wealth management service that includes a retirement 401 k service a mutual fund service and an annuity investment service as component services. In either case display area provides Auto Policy and Wealth Management headings based on the services associated with Joel s personal role. As illustrated Joel may set document delivery preferences based on a tree like selection structure where selecting expands document delivery preferences and selecting collapses document delivery preferences. As illustrated Joel has elected to set or modify document delivery preferences for a mutual fund computerized insurance service from the computerized insurance services . In the example Joel is able to set document delivery preferences for monthly statements quarterly statements year end yearly statements and prospectuses. As illustrated Joel has selected to receive yearly statements by paper delivery. However Joel also has the option to select to receive yearly statements by e mail or fax as well as by any other suitable document delivery method though these additional delivery methods are not explicitly shown in .

In general the document types monthly statements quarterly statements year end statements and prospectuses in and delivery options e mail paper delivery and fax in displayed in display area depend on the particular computerized insurance service and the role for which delivery preferences are being set. For example an auto insurance policy service may include document types of policy renewal documents and insurance claim status reports which are not typically documents associated with a mutual fund service. As another example a retirement 401 k policy may allow e mail and paper delivery but not fax delivery of some or all documents types based on security considerations. As another example a retirement 401 k service may allow delivery of prospectuses but not monthly or quarterly statements to users who access the retirement 401 k service through a beneficiary role. Thus options for monthly or quarterly statements would not appear in the display area for these users. On the other hand users who are affiliated with the retirement 401 k service through a personal role may be allowed to select delivery options for each of monthly statements quarterly statements and prospectuses.

The document types and delivery options may further depend on a security level e.g. an authentication score associated with a user of the graphical user interface . For example if a user s authentication score is sufficiently low e mail delivery of a particular document type may not be possible for the user. In some embodiments the user may be given the option to increase his or her security credentials e.g. the authentication score in order to select the delivery via the desired method.

For example padlock icon indicates that while Joel is not currently able to select e mail delivery of yearly statements in a mutual fund service Joel may use step up authentication procedures to increase his authentication score so that e mail delivery may be selected. In some embodiments Joel would select radio button and then be directed by the graphical user interface to provide secure information items and or security credentials to appropriately increase his authentication score and or related access rights. Further the increase in authentication score may be temporary valid for the current activity session or may permanently increase Joel s authentication score and or related access rights. Similarly Joel may be restricted from selecting document delivery preferences for certain roles without first performing authentication procedures to temporarily or permanently increase his authentication score and or related access rights as indicated by padlock icon . Temporary and permanent step up authentication procedures are described more fully in relation to of this disclosure.

As illustrated in the profile module security module and portal module are all communicatively coupled to each other and also to the computerized insurance services . Further each of these modules is communicatively coupled to the network interface . The portal module provides instructions for the display of graphical user interface to a user of the front end computing system . Additionally these instructions may be sent directly from one of the individual computerized insurance services . A user s selections on the graphical user interface are routed by the portal module to the computerized insurance services the profile module or the security module as appropriate.

Each global user identity registered with the integrated insurance system is associated with one or more roles. A role describes the nature of the user s interactions with the front end computing system in a certain capacity which may be personal or professional. As an illustrative example consider a customer of the insurance company named Joel Smith who owns a small business which is covered by a business insurance policy has a personal health insurance policy in which a claim was recently filed and is designated as the beneficiary on another party s life insurance policy with the insurance company. Suppose further that Joel is registered with the front end computing system using a global user identity of JoelSmith12345. The user identity JoelSmith12345 would be associated with at least the following roles 

Role information is used to customize presentation and security features of the front end computing system. For example when Joel logs in under his policy holder role a link to both a health insurance service and a business insurance service from the computerized insurance services will be displayed in the display area additionally information from the specific policies of these services that relate to Joel may be displayed in the graphical user interface . When Joel logs in under the claimant role a link to the current status of his personal health insurance claim may be displayed in the display area . Importantly as will be described further each user identity and role is associated with an authentication score. The authentication score is used to selectively grant access to certain features of the computerized insurance services .

The profile module stores or else maintains pointers to information for each user identity that is registered or that has attempted to be registered with the front end computing system . This information includes for each user identity and role if multiple roles are associated with a given user identity 

A non exhaustive list of roles associated with the front end computing system includes agent applicant assignee auditor beneficiary biller broker buyer carrier claim expert claimant claimee coinsurer contractor credit specialist customer employee insured legal advisor paying agent policy holder reinsurer requester retiree supplier investor and underwriter.

In some embodiments the agent role is used by an agent of the insurance company to access information related to customer accounts served by the agent on behalf of the insurance company. For example an agent of the insurance company may represent dozens or hundreds of customers of the insurance company. When the agent logs into the front end computing system under the agent role the agent may be able to access policy information for these customers e.g. in response to a customer request to do so . In some embodiments the agent s access under the agent role is restricted only to those types of policies and or services that the agent directly services e.g. if the agent works only in auto insurance sales and service then the agent would only have access to the auto insurance component of customer policies . In other embodiments the agent is granted access to information for the other computerized insurance services that agent s customers use. The agent may use this additional information to identify opportunities to add remove or otherwise modify the insurance services used by a customer. The agent may then recommend insurance coverage changes to the customer based on this additional information. In some embodiments an agent is only granted access to customer accounts after explicit approval is granted by the customer.

The profile module includes a profile utility which includes a number of support services including support services and as well as other support services not explicitly illustrated in . The support services interact with the other components of the integrated insurance system to provide a uniform experience to users. In some embodiments the services and include one or more of a data pre populate service a data verification service a merge and link service a role management service and a data update service.

The data pre populate service of profile utility can be called by one of the computerized insurance services as a request for information stored in connection with the portal module . For example one of the computerized insurance services may pre populate a new account form based on global contact information name address phone number and or e mail retrieved from the profile module . In another example web pages and forms presented to a user of one of the computerized insurance services may be pre populated based on a default language preference e.g. English associated with a current user identity and role that is obtained by calling the role management service of the profile utility .

The data verification service of profile utility can be called by one of the computerized insurance services as a request for authentication information past transaction history or other information related to verifying a user identity or an authentication score associated with a user identity. As an illustrative example a user may attempt to access a restricted service such as a beneficiary designation form while using a wealth management service included as one of the computerized insurance services . In this case the wealth management service investment service may make a request to the data verification service of profile utility in two ways. First when a user first attempts to login to the wealth management service the wealth management service sends a query to the data verification service of profile utility to determine whether an authentication score of the user under the role is greater than a first threshold value. Second when a user attempts to use the wealth management service to change the beneficiary form the wealth management service sends another query to data verification service of profile utility to determine whether the authentication score of the user also under the current role is greater than a second greater threshold value.

The data update service of profile utility can be called by one of the computerized insurance services by security module by portal module or by other components of the integrated insurance system to provide updates to stored user profile information including updates to a transaction history associated with a user identity. As an illustrative example a user may change a phone number on a beneficiary form in one of the computerized insurance services e.g. to be different than pre populated information . In this case the computerized insurance service would send a data update request to the profile utility to update the phone number so that the updated number is available globally throughout the computerized insurance services . Before doing so a user may be prompted to indicate whether they want the change to apply globally or just within the active computerized insurance service.

The merge and link service of profile utility can be called by one of the computerized insurance services by security module by portal module or by other components of the integrated insurance system . The merge and link service is responsible for merging and linking legacy accounts i.e. accounts previously created for individual ones of the computerized insurance services . In some embodiments a user s legacy accounts are identified by profile utility merged if the legacy accounts are substantially compatible or linked if the legacy accounts are not substantially compatible . In some embodiments the merging and or linking is performed upon initial self registration and the merged and or linked accounts are then used to create a single global user identity for use with the integrated insurance system . During the merging process a user may be prompted to resolve conflicting data from the to be merged accounts e.g. conflicting address information .

The role management service of profile utility can be called by one of the computerized insurance services by security module by portal module or by other components of the integrated insurance system . The service permits a user to add and remove roles associated with a given user identity.

The profile module includes a My Profile utility . The My Profile utility is responsible for handling updates and modifications to user profile information when a user directly changes profile information via link on graphical user interface .

The profile module includes a profile administrative applications utility . The profile administrative applications utility allows an external user to call applications to view modify and or export stored profile information. For example an employee of the insurance company may invoke the profile administrative applications utility using one of the company terminals . Similarly manual adjustments to the information stored through the profile module can be made by executing the applications of the profile administrative applications utility .

The security module includes a security utility which includes a number of support services including support services and as well as other support services not explicitly illustrated in . The support services interact with the other components of the integrated insurance system to globally manage security aspects of user self registration authentication and authorization. In some embodiments the services and include one or more of an information collection service a data verification service an authentication score management service a credential service and an authentication service.

The information collection service of the security utility can be called by one of the computerized insurance services the portal module the profile module or some other component of the integrated insurance system . The information collection service obtains information about a user identity necessary to make a decision as to whether to issue one or more security credentials to the user. This information may be obtained by calling the profile module by generating queries to a user for information or by accessing information from the external databases or the internal information repository and prompting the user for some of the accessed information. The information can also be obtained from other sources such as information provided by a user to a representative of the insurance company information mailed to the insurance company by the user or information submitted to the insurance company by a third party provider based on an in person visit of the user to the third party provider e.g. results of drug and substance tests .

The data verification service of the security utility can be called by one of the computerized insurance services the portal module the profile module or other component of the integrated insurance system . The data verification service compares information received from the user using the information collection service to objective measures of performance and or to data received from trusted sources. As an illustrative example a substance and drug test result submitted by a user via the information collection service may be compared to predefined tables to determine whether the test is a pass by the standards of the insurance company. Non binary measures may also be used to assess the performance of the test. As another example financial record information provided by a user may be compared to public records available in one of the external databases to corroborate the provided information. In some embodiments the data verification service provides a verification score which indicates the degree to which the user has been verified. The verification score may be a number e.g. between 1 and 100 and may depend both on the amount of information requested by the information collection service and the results of the data verification process.

The credential service of the security utility establishes one or more security credentials for a user based on the verification score. In some embodiments no credentials are issued unless the verification score is above a threshold. The one or more security credentials may be issued by the insurance company e.g. a secure RSA token code supplied by the user e.g. a password or a combination thereof. In some embodiments the user may select from different types of possible security credentials and establish the selected types of security credentials. Once established the one or more credentials are recorded by the security module for future reference.

The authentication score management service of the security utility establishes and updates an authentication score for each user identity and role registered with front end computing system . The authentication score management service first determines an initial authentication score based on the verification score. In some embodiments the initial authentication score is equal to the data verification score. Further the authentication score management service updates the score based on user activity for example failed and successful login attempts and provides the authentication score to requesting services. Further the authentication score management services initiates activities that allow a user to temporarily or permanently increase the authentication score associated with a user identity and or role.

As an illustrative example a user may request to access a feature of a given one of the computerized insurance services for which the user does not have a high enough authentication score. In this case the computerized insurance service may call the authentication score management service of the security module . Alternatively the security module may monitor user interactions with the computerized insurance service and initiate a call of the authentication score management service on its own. In either case the authentication score management service may proceed by retrieving the relevant authentication score from the profile module based on a currently active user identity and role comparing it to a required authentication score threshold and providing a value of a required increase in the authentication score to the information collection service of the security module . The information collection service the data verification service and the credential service may execute as described above in order to establish an authentication score for the user that will be sufficient for the user to access the desired feature.

The authentication service of the security utility authenticates a user by prompting the user for one or more previously established security credentials and authenticating the user if correct or sufficiently correct responses are supplied in response to the prompts.

The security module includes a My Security utility . The My Security utility is responsible for handling security related updates and modifications that may be requested directly by a user via the graphical user interface . A user may access the My Security utility from the display panel described in . In some embodiments not explicitly shown in a separate My Security link is presented on graphical user interface and a user may click on the link to display a panel similar in design to the display panel but displaying primarily security related options.

The security module includes a security administrative applications utility . The security administrative applications utility allows an external user to call applications to view modify and or export stored registration and authentication information. For example an employee of the insurance company may invoke the security administrative applications utility using one of the company terminals . Similarly manual adjustments to the information stored through the security module can be made.

As illustrated in the security utility includes registration logic and authentication logic . The registration logic includes specialized software and or hardware components configured to allow users to self register for a global account for use with the front end computing system . Similarly the authentication logic includes specialized software and or hardware components configured to authenticate and grant access rights to users of the front end computing system . The registration logic and authentication logic are each used to invoke appropriate support services of the security module. In some embodiments the registration logic executes some or all of the self registration computing steps described in relation to while the authentication logic is used to execute some or all of the authentication and authorization computing steps described in relation to .

The front end computing system receives a request for self registration of a user identity step . The self registration request may be initiated directly by a user who selects the self registration link of the graphical user interface . In this case the self registration request is sent from the portal module to the security utility . Additionally the self registration request may be initiated automatically by one of the computerized insurance services after a user logs in directly to one of the individual computerized insurance services e.g. during a period in which an insurance company is transitioning existing user accounts for the individual computerized insurance services into a single global account for the front end computing system . In this case the self registration request is sent from the individual computerized insurance service to the security utility . Upon receiving the self registration request the security utility invokes registration logic to execute one or more of the support services of the security module to perform self registration.

The security utility invokes the information collection service of the security module to collect one or more secure information items associated with the user identity step . The security module uses the collected secure information items to verify that a user is who he she claims to be at the time that self registration is requested. To collect the secure information items the information collection service queries the user for identifying information. To do so the information collection service may generate queries by pooling information from the internal information repository the external databases the information stored by the user profile module and or information obtained in connection with legacy accounts registered with the computerized insurance services . Additionally the information collection service may request information from a user that requires the user to provide identification and verification information e.g. biometric information to a representative of the insurance company over the telephone by visiting a local branch of the insurance company or a third party site and or by mailing materials to the insurance company.

The security utility invokes the data verification service to verify data and determine a verification score step . The data verification is determined by comparing user supplied answers from step with expected answers where applicable and or predefined response ranges where applicable . In some embodiments each user answer is assigned a numerical value and the user s verification score is equal to the sum value of the numerical values associated with the user s answers. The security utility also invokes the data verification service to compare the verification score with a threshold value needed to self register the requested user identity.

If the verification score exceeds the threshold value determined at step the user identity is registered step . A method for registering a user is explained in greater detail in relation to . On the other hand if the verification score does not exceed the threshold value determined at step the front end computing system declines to register the user identity. In certain embodiments the registration logic returns to collect additional information about the user at step . In certain embodiments the declination places a block on registry of the user identity until further action is taken e.g. a customer calls the insurance company . Even if a user identity is declined for registration at step information about the user identity is stored in the profile module . For example the specific user interactions that resulted in declining registration are stored.

The security utility invokes the credential service of the security module to set or establish one or more security credentials for the user step . The security credentials may include biometric identifiers passwords RSA tokens security images and other credentials. In some embodiments the user can choose certain security credentials from a plurality of possible security credentials. Further some of the set security credentials step may correspond to information provided during data collection step . For example a user may have supplied a fingerprint identifier during an in person visit to a local branch of the insurance company step and this fingerprint identifier may be set as a security credential step . In addition to setting security credentials step the credential service also supplies the user with the information needed to provide the security credentials in subsequent sessions with the front end computing system . For example instructions may be sent to mail to the user an RSA key generator and or a fingerprint scanner. Information on established credentials may also be presented to the user on a screen.

In some embodiments one or more security credentials may be set or established at step by importing security credentials previously established by the user with respect to other trusted services maintained by the insurance company. For example in some embodiments security credentials previously established with respect to individual ones of the computerized insurance services are imported at step and this saves the user the time and inconvenience of having to establish some or all of the security credentials normally required during registration with the front end computing system at step . In some embodiments security credentials are imported from trusted third party services i.e. that are not maintained or owned by the insurance company. Examples of trusted third party services may include a third party verification service a third party identity management service or a trusted affiliated business. For example a user may have already completed similar security procedures with respect to an independently owned and operated third party brokerage website. In this case the insurance company may have an agreement with the third party brokerage website to allow the importation of the user s previously established security credentials during the user s registration with the front end computing system at step . In some embodiments the trusted third party service is an identification or verification service run by a state or federal government or a service that that collects and provides state or federal government records e.g. Department of Motor Vehicle DMV records and or passport related records .

The profile utility invokes the merge and link service to merge and or link legacy user accounts step . Specifically the merge and link service queries some or all of the computerized insurance services to determine if legacy accounts have been created corresponding to the user identity. The user may also be prompted to provide information on possible legacy accounts to the merge and link service which then verifies this information. Once the legacy accounts have been identified they are either merged and or linked to the newly registered global user identity. In some embodiments legacy login information is rendered inactive once the legacy account is merged with the newly registered global user identity and the user is forced to use the global user identity in future interactions with the integrated insurance system . For some legacy accounts the legacy account is linked rather than merged to the newly registered global user identity. Linking of the user account to the global user identity enables much of the same functionality as account merging but leaves the linked legacy account active so that a user can still use the old account information to directly log in to the corresponding computerized insurance service.

In some embodiments the information platform running a linked legacy account proactively generates most or all of the calls to the user profile module and the security module i.e. rather than relying on queries initiated by these modules to the information platform to provide similar or identical integrative functionality to profile and security services as available for merged legacy accounts. For example when user logs in directly to a legacy linked account the legacy linked account may proactively generate one or more calls to the security module so that login authentication can be performed using the information established from the user s global user identity. Instructions between the legacy account and the security module may be translated using an API or any other technique or system. This translation may be performed by the information platform running the legacy account by the security module or by another intermediary computing device or resource.

The profile utility invokes the role management service to automatically create roles for the newly registered user identity step . The automatic creation of roles is context sensitive. For example roles may be created for some or all of the merged legacy accounts determined at step based on a type of the legacy account. A merged business insurance legacy account may result in the automatic creation of a business owner role and the population of the user profile information of the newly created user identity with information from the business account. Similarly a merged health insurance account that includes a recently filed claim may result in the creation of two roles a policy holder role reflecting the personal health insurance policy in general and a claimant role reflecting a recently submitted health insurance claim submitting for the policy.

The profile utility invokes the role management service to add or remove roles from those automatically created step . In addition a user may add or change default preferences associated with each role. For example a user may select a preferred contact method e.g. among phone mail or e mail and default display options for the graphical user interface associated with each role.

The security utility invokes the authentication score management service of the security module to determine an initial authentication score for each role of the user identity step . The initial authentication score may be set based on the verification score determined at step . Additionally or alternatively the initial authentication score may be based on an access device used by the user an IP address of a user device used to access the self registration process the one or more secure information items supplied by the user step the security credentials set and or provided to the user step as well as other information. In some embodiments the authentication score is a positive valued integer with higher values indicating higher degrees of trust that a user identity corresponds to the registered customer.

The profile utility and security utility create a user profile and security profile respectively for the user identity step . The user profile and security profile store information provided and inferred about the user identity in the steps illustrated in . For example the user profile stores the user identity roles associated with the user identity preferences associated with the roles the initial authentication score for each role and logs some or all of the user interactions with the front end computer system during the self registration process. The security profile stores information related to the one or more security credentials supplied to the user that will later be used by the user to authenticate himself or herself to the front end computing system in subsequent activity sessions.

The integrated insurance system receives a user login request to one of the computerized insurance services step . The login request includes a user identity and one or more previously established security credentials associated with the user identity. The login request is received from a user interacting with one of the user computing devices and .

Before the user is permitted to access the requested computerized insurance service the security module determines an authentication score associated with the user identity the supplied security credentials and a role step . In some embodiments the authentication score consists of a base component retrieved from storage of the integrated insurance system and a dynamic component based on activities that occur during the user s current activity session. The component parts of the authentication score will be further described in the subsequent disclosure.

The security module determines a set of access rights that will govern the user s interactions with the computerized insurance service step . Examples of access rights will be provided in the subsequent disclosure. However a basic access right is entry. If the entry access right is included the user will be permitted baseline access to the selected computerized insurance service in which at least some basic features are available to the user.

The integrated insurance system receives a request to access a feature of the computerized insurance service that is not included in the set of access rights step . For example a user may request to change beneficiary information associated with an annuity investment service after logging in to the service but may have only been granted basic read or view access step to the annuity investment service when the user initially logged in which does not include a right to change potentially sensitive beneficiary information e.g. the name of a beneficiary and or an allocation of the account among several beneficiaries . As another example a user may request to change the amount of coverage for her husband within a life insurance computerized service but may have only been granted basic read access step to the life insurance service when she initially logged in.

The integrated insurance system determines whether one or more additional previously established security credentials exist and if so whether the user s supply of the security credentials would sufficiently raise the user s authentication score so as to grant the requested access right. If such credentials are available the user is prompted to supply information on some or all of the credentials step . Otherwise the user is queried to determine if the user wishes to take additional authentication actions to increase the set of access rights to the required level to gain the desired access right step .

The authentication score management service of the security module determines possible combinations of the remaining one or more security credentials that if properly answered would allow the requested access right step . The system then prompts the user to enter one of these combinations. In some embodiments the authentication score management service of the security module allows the user to choose a valid combination of the one or more additional security credentials and then prompts the user for the selected credential information. Based on the user s supplied information the authentication score management service of the security module updates the authentication score and updates the set of access rights.

For example a user may have previously e.g. at an earlier date established three additional security credentials that were not provided when the user initially logged in step . For example the user may have logged in using a standard eight to ten digital password at step but may have also previously established the following three security credentials answers to a set of security questions related to the user s personal life e.g. a name of a middle school attended name of a grandparent and name of a favorite athlete a customized pin code for an RSA code generation tool in the user s possession and a fingerprint scan created a biometric scanner in the user s possession. In this case the authentication score management service of the security module may determine that if the user were to correctly provide at least two of the three unused security credentials i.e. the set of security answers the RSA code and the fingerprint that the user s authentication score would be sufficiently increased so that the requested access right would be included in an updated set of access rights. The security module may then generate instructions for displaying a prompt to the user to select any two of the three previously established security credentials and enter the corresponding information.

The authentication service of the security module determines if the requested access right is in the updated set of access rights step this may not be the case if the user improperly supplies some of the additional security credentials . If so the user is allowed to access the requested feature of the computerized insurance service step . If not the user is queried to determine if the user wishes to take additional authentication actions to increase the set of access rights step . Alternatively the integrated insurance system may simply deny access to the requested feature step .

If the user elects to increase the set of access rights at step the user is prompted for one or more additional secure information items associated with the user identity step . Specifically the security utility invokes the information collection service of the security module to collect one or more additional secure information items associated with the user identity. The security module uses the collected secure information items to verify that a user is who they claim to be. To collect the secure information items the information collection service queries the user for identifying information. For example the information collection service may query the user using technique similar or identical to those described in relation to step .

To do so the information collection service may generate queries by pooling information from the internal information repository the external databases the information stored by the user profile module and or information obtained in connection with legacy accounts registered with the computerized insurance services . Additionally the information collection service may request information from a user that requires the user to provide information to a representative of the insurance company over the telephone visit a local branch of the insurance company or a third party site to provide identification and verification information e.g. biometric information or mail additional information to the insurance company. The authentication score management service of the security module updates the user authentication score and updates the set of access rights associated with the updated authentication score.

The authentication service of the security module determines if the requested access right is in the updated set of access rights step . If so the user is allowed to access the requested feature of the computerized insurance service step . If not the integrated insurance system may simply deny access to the requested feature step .

The method is executed when the integrated insurance system receives a user identity as a first part of an attempted user login step . Upon receiving a user identity and before corresponding login security credentials are supplied the security module calls the profile module to retrieve a base authentication score for the user identity step . The base authentication score is typically a number value that represents a previously existing and stored component of an overall authentication score for the user identity. In certain embodiments the base authentication score is set based on the number and nature of the security credentials previously established for the user identity i.e. during initial self registration and any subsequent step up authentication procedures as well as based on a past history of user interactions with the integrated insurance system .

The base authentication score further depends on roles associated with the user identity. Specifically if a default role is assigned to the user identity then the base authentication score that is retrieved is the base authentication score for the default role. Otherwise if no default role has been set then the base authentication score is assigned to the lowest base authentication score for any of the roles associated with the user identity. Further the base authentication score is modified lowered after retrieval if invalid login credentials were supplied e.g. if a predetermined number of invalid login attempts are detected .

After receiving valid login credentials the security module sets a dynamic authentication score for the user identity and role step . The dynamic authentication score represents a temporary adjustment to the base authentication score effective only for the current user activity session based on user activities and external events. The dynamic authentication score may depend on a type of user device used to access the integrated insurance system . A less secure device e.g. a mobile phone results in a lower dynamic authentication score than a more secure device e.g. a desktop computer . The dynamic authentication depends on the particular credentials supplied by the user from among the potentially larger number of credentials established by the user to login during the current activity session. Further the dynamic authentication score may depend on an IP address used to access the integrated insurance system relative to a history of IP address use. In some embodiments the overall user authentication score during an activity session is represented as the sum of the base authentication score and the dynamic authentication score i.e. authentication score base authentication score dynamic authentication score. Next the security module waits step for one of a number of predetermined events to occur.

Upon receiving a user request to increase a set of access rights for a given computerized insurance service step the security module modifies either the base or the dynamic authentication score. In particular the security module determines if the request for access rights is for a temporary increase in the access rights step . If so the security module modifies the dynamic authentication score step . Otherwise the secure module modifies the base authentication score step . The security module then returns to the wait state for one of the predetermined number of events to again occur i.e. at steps and during the current activity session.

Upon receiving a user request to change access settings via the My Security utility step the security module modifies the base authentication score. For example a user may wish to permanently establish additional security credentials using the My Security utility . If the additional security credentials are properly established the security module would increase the base authentication score accordingly. On the other hand if the attempt to establish additional security credentials fails e.g. a user fails to follow through with a visit to a third party testing facility for identity verification the security module would decrease the base authentication score. The security module then returns to the wait state for one of the predetermined number of events to again occur i.e. at steps and during the current activity session.

Upon receiving a user request to change settings via the My Profile utility step the security module modifies the base authentication score. For example a user may elect to change account delivery preferences from e mail to traditional paper delivery. In certain embodiments the security module would lower a base authentication score in response since paper is typically less secure and results in an increased chance of account exposure to unwanted third parties compared to e mail delivery. The security module then returns to the wait state for one of the predetermined number of events to again occur i.e. at steps and during the current activity session.

Upon detecting a predetermined non user action step the security module modifies either the base or the dynamic authentication score. As an illustrative example after a user has logged in to the integrated insurance system the integrated insurance system may additionally detect another attempt to login using the user identity e.g. from an unfamiliar IP address . In this case the security module would significantly reduce the base authentication score associated with the user identity. Security module is also capable of modifying the dynamic authentication score associated upon detecting one of a predetermined number of non user actions. For example if the security module detects a user IP address dynamically changing to a new IP address for example due to the user roaming on a mobile device the security module may increase the dynamic authentication score. The security module then returns to the wait state for one of the predetermined number of events to again occur i.e. at steps and during the current activity session.

Upon waiting a predetermined amount of time since a user activity step the security module modifies the dynamic authentication score. For example the predetermined amount of time may correspond to 10 minutes. Thus whenever 10 minutes elapses without user activity the dynamic authentication score is decreased. The security module then returns to the wait state for one of the predetermined number of events to again occur i.e. at steps and during the current activity session.

An administrator of the integrated insurance system may makes changes directly or indirectly to the user authentication score when the user is offline. Upon receiving user administrative changes step the security module modifies the base authentication score. As an example a customer of the insurance company may call to inform the insurance company that his home was recently burglarized or that he was a victim of identity theft in some other non insurance context an employee of the insurance company may manually adjust the base authentication score to reflect this fact. Administrative changes may be entered using company terminals . In some embodiments the company terminals execute computer software that allows an administrator to directly adjust an authentication score for a user identity and corresponding role s . In other embodiments the administrator specifies a set of access rights or a desired modification of the set of access rights and the integrated insurance system automatically determines a suitable adjustment to the authentication score for the user identity and the corresponding role s .

The security module may automatically make off line changes directly or indirectly to the user authentication score step . For example the integrated insurance system may automatically detect that the user identity of a family member of a given user has been compromised through the means described above. In this case the security module may lower the base authentication score for all user identities belonging to individuals living in the same household.

In some embodiments rather than use a variable authentication score the threshold authentication score values described in this disclosure are variable with respect to events that occur after a user activity session begins.

Although the base authentication score and dynamic authentication score are described throughout the disclosure primarily as positive integer values it would be understood by one of ordinary skill that the base authentication score and or the dynamic authentication score may be represented using other techniques. For example the base authentication score and dynamic authentication score may also be represented as percentage values e.g. between 0 and 100 percent by using a finite number of authentication levels i.e. where each level is a quantitative or qualitative value by any other discrete or continuous valued parameter as a tranche value e.g. the top 5 10 or 20 of authentication scores across all accounts registered with the front end computing system or by any suitable combination of these and other representations.

Data structure illustrates the storage of user identities and the corresponding computerized insurance services used by those user identities. In particular illustrates the storage of three user identities and variables indicating the registered insurance services for each of these user identities. As illustrated the user identity Joel Smith123 has access to denoted by the symbol x property business and annuity investment services but does not have access to denoted by the symbol life or vehicle insurance services. Similarly the user identity Adam Jones425 has access to life vehicle and business insurance services but does not have access to property or annuity investment services. Additionally the user identity Mary Molita322 has access to property business and annuity investment services but does not have access to life or vehicle insurance services. Further although not shown in the data structure stores information on whether the user identities of Joel Smith123 Adam Jones425 and Mary Molita322 are registered for additional insurance services denoted by the ellipses and stores information on additional user identities. In some embodiments the elements of the data structure i.e. denoted by x or are implemented as a binary valued variables. In some embodiments a user identity is considered to have access to a given insurance service if at least one role associated with the user identity has access to the computerized insurance service based on the base authentication score of that role.

Data structure illustrates the storage of profile security role and other information for a given user identity and a given computerized insurance service from the computerized insurance services . In particular data structure illustrates the storage of information related to Joel Smith123 s access to annuity investments. As illustrated in Joel Smith123 is affiliated with the annuity investment service through a personal role and a beneficiary role. Some of the information stored in connection with the personal role is displayed in row and some of the information stored in connection with the beneficiary role is displayed in row . For example row indicates the storage of in addition to the role a policy ID the base authentication score for the role and a minimum authentication score required to access a corresponding annuity investment service i.e. the annuity investment service .

Further row indicates the storage of an enhanced authentication score which indicates an authentication score required for access to one or more enhanced access rights within the annuity investment service. For example the enhanced authentication score may indicate a score required to withdraw funds from the annuity and to change beneficiary information associated with the annuity. As another example for a life insurance computerized insurance service the enhanced authentication score may indicate a score required to modify coverage amounts and file a claim online using the life insurance service. Further row indicates the storage of delivery preferences associated with the user identity Joel Smith123 with the annuity investment service in the role of personal and in connection with policy ID 1754364.

Although not explicitly illustrated in more than one policy ID may be associated with a given user identity and role. For example Joel Smith may be a beneficiary with respect to the annuity investment service on a second policy in addition to the policy having an ID of 1754364 which is depicted in data structure . Although not explicitly shown in data structure may store additional information related to a given user identity role and policy ID. For example sets of access rights associated with some or all of the base authentication score minimum authentication score and enhanced authentication score may be stored by the data structure .

In some embodiments the data structure depends from the data structure according to a nested implementation. For example a data structure of the form of the data structure may associated with and stored in connection to each element from the data structure . In some embodiments the data structures and are stored using a linked list hierarchical structure. In some implementations the data structures and are stored using a three dimensional matrix type implementation structure where a given entry of a two dimensional matrix representing the data structure stores the information corresponding to the data structure .

Global accounts for the front end computing system have been described in the disclosure herein primarily as follows. Each user of the front end computing system is assigned a unique user identity which may then be associated with one or more roles. However it will be understood by one of ordinary skill that the front end computing system may be implemented using a different structure for the assignment user identities and roles to users. In some embodiments a user of the front end computing system is assigned a different user identity for each role recognized by the front end computing system . For example a single user would have a different user identity for each of claimant personal and business roles with the front end computing system . Further the various user identities for a given user may be used with a single common set of established security credentials or a different set of established security credentials may be assigned to each user identity.

In some embodiments each user of the front end computing system is assigned a unique user identity and the security credentials e.g. a password provided during login determines which role is used when the user logs in to the front end computing system . For example a user Joel Smith may be assigned a user identity of Joel Smith123. Joel Smith may also be assigned two different passwords or more generally two different sets of security credentials corresponding to two different roles e.g. a claimant role and a business role . Joel Smith would then enter the password corresponding to the desired role when logging in to the front end computing system for a given activity session. In some embodiments the different roles for Joel Smith are linked. For example Joel Smith may login using the claimant role and may be able to select the business role via the graphical user interface . Alternatively the two roles may be distinct and Joel Smith may be required to login with the password corresponding to the claimant role to access the front end computing system according to this role.
