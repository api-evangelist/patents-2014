The present application is a continuation of and claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 645 874 entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR MAINTAINING TRANSPARENT END TO END CACHE REDIRECTION and filed Dec. 23 2009 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

The present application generally relates to data communication networks. In particular the present application relates to systems and methods for maintaining an internet protocol address of a server by an intermediary network device.

A corporate or enterprise may deploy a number of services across a network to enhance the quality of service provided by the enterprise to the clients accessing the services via servers of the enterprise. The servers of the enterprise may be optimized in a number of ways to meet the demand and load from the volume of clients requests. In some configurations the enterprise may further provide one or more intermediaries to manage the network traffic from the clients requesting access to one or more enterprise servers.

In some instances a client s request may identify an internet protocol IP address of the client machine. An intermediary device intercepting the request may check if the content requested by the client request has been cached. An intermediary network device such as an enterprise intermediary device or a cache server may handle the client request in accordance with a configuration or a policy. The destination server may receive the client request comprising a modified IP address.

The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for maintaining an internet protocol IP address of a client from a client request while performing cache redirection. The present disclosure may further relate to maintaining an original source IP address or an original destination IP address of a client request received by an intermediary device upon a cache miss by a cache server. In some configurations an intermediary device deployed between a client and a destination server may intercept a client request for a content at the destination server. In order to facilitate the client request faster the intermediary may send the client request to a cache server to check if the content requested is cached. In some instances when the content requested by the client request is not cached by the cache server the cache server may return the client request back to the intermediary while modifying the original source IP address into another source IP address. By preserving the original source IP address in a header of the client request intermediary device may maintain the original source IP address even if the cache server returns the client request back to the intermediary upon a cache miss. Therefore the original source IP address of the client request may be preserved by including the original source IP address of the client request into the request forwarded from the intermediary device to the cache server and the request returned by the cache server to the intermediary device.

In some instances the intermediary device may preserve both the original source IP address and the original destination IP address while forwarding the client request back and forth to the cache server by using data link layer properties for the intermediary device to the cache server communication. In some embodiments the intermediary may establish connections with the cache server and receive from the cache server returned client request by identifying data link layer properties of the cache server in the client request. By using the data link layer properties to identify the received request the original source IP address and the original destination IP address of the client request may be transparently preserved throughout the client request path from the client to the server.

In accordance with Moore s Law the number of transistors that may be placed on an integrated circuit may double approximately every two years. However CPU speed increases may reach plateaus for example CPU speed has been around 3.5 4 GHz range since 2005. In some cases CPU manufacturers may not rely on CPU speed increases to gain additional performance. Some CPU manufacturers may add additional cores to their processors to provide additional performance. Products such as those of software and networking vendors that rely on CPUs for performance gains may improve their performance by leveraging these multi core CPUs. The software designed and constructed for a single CPU may be redesigned and or rewritten to take advantage of a multi threaded parallel architecture or otherwise a multi core architecture.

A multi core architecture of the appliance referred to as nCore or multi core technology allows the appliance in some embodiments to break the single core performance barrier and to leverage the power of multi core CPUs. In the previous architecture described in connection with a single network or packet engine is run. The multiple cores of the nCore technology and architecture allow multiple packet engines to run concurrently and or in parallel. With a packet engine running on each core the appliance architecture leverages the processing capacity of additional cores. In some embodiments this provides up to a 7 increase in performance and scalability.

Illustrated in are some embodiments of work task load or network traffic distribution across one or more processor cores according to a type of parallelism or parallel computing scheme such as functional parallelism data parallelism or flow based data parallelism. In brief overview illustrates embodiments of a multi core system such as an appliance with n cores a total of cores numbers 1 through N. In one embodiment work load or network traffic can be distributed among a first core A a second core B a third core C a fourth core D a fifth core E a sixth core F a seventh core G and so on such that distribution is across all or two or more of the n cores N hereinafter referred to collectively as cores . There may be multiple VIPs each running on a respective core of the plurality of cores. There may be multiple packet engines each running on a respective core of the plurality of cores. Any of the approaches used may lead to different varying or similar work load or performance level across any of the cores. For a functional parallelism approach each core may run a different function of the functionalities provided by the packet engine a VIP or appliance . In a data parallelism approach data may be paralleled or distributed across the cores based on the Network Interface Card NIC or VIP receiving the data. In another data parallelism approach processing may be distributed across the cores by distributing data flows to each core.

In further detail to in some embodiments load work or network traffic can be distributed among cores according to functional parallelism . Functional parallelism may be based on each core performing one or more respective functions. In some embodiments a first core may perform a first function while a second core performs a second function. In functional parallelism approach the functions to be performed by the multi core system are divided and distributed to each core according to functionality. In some embodiments functional parallelism may be referred to as task parallelism and may be achieved when each processor or core executes a different process or function on the same or different data. The core or processor may execute the same or different code. In some cases different execution threads or code may communicate with one another as they work. Communication may take place to pass data from one thread to the next as part of a workflow.

In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to functional parallelism can comprise distributing network traffic according to a particular function such as network input output management NW I O A secure sockets layer SSL encryption and decryption B and transmission control protocol TCP functions C. This may lead to a work performance or computing load based on a volume or level of functionality being used. In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to data parallelism can comprise distributing an amount of work based on distributing data associated with a particular hardware or software component. In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to flow based data parallelism can comprise distributing data based on a context or flow such that the amount of work A N on each core may be similar substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed.

In the case of the functional parallelism approach each core may be configured to run one or more functionalities of the plurality of functionalities provided by the packet engine or VIP of the appliance. For example core 1 may perform network I O processing for the appliance while core 2 performs TCP connection management for the appliance. Likewise core 3 may perform SSL offloading while core 4 may perform layer 7 or application layer processing and traffic management. Each of the cores may perform the same function or different functions. Each of the cores may perform more than one function. Any of the cores may run any of the functionality or portions thereof identified and or described in conjunction with . In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of performance or load .

For example core 1 may perform network I O processing for the appliance while core 2 performs TCP connection management for the appliance.

In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of load or performance.

The functionality or tasks may be distributed in any arrangement and scheme. For example illustrates a first core Core 1 A processing applications and processes associated with network I O functionality A. Network traffic associated with network I O in some embodiments can be associated with a particular port number. Thus outgoing and incoming packets having a port destination associated with NW I O A will be directed towards Core 1 A which is dedicated to handling all network traffic associated with the NW I O port. Similarly Core 2 B is dedicated to handling functionality associated with SSL processing and Core 4 D may be dedicated handling all TCP level processing and functionality.

While illustrates functions such as network I O SSL and TCP other functions can be assigned to cores. These other functions can include any one or more of the functions or operations described herein. For example any of the functions described in conjunction with may be distributed across the cores on a functionality basis. In some cases a first VIP A may run on a first core while a second VIP B with a different configuration may run on a second core. In some embodiments each core can handle a particular functionality such that each core can handle the processing associated with that particular function. For example Core 2 B may handle SSL offloading while Core 4 D may handle application layer processing and traffic management.

In other embodiments work load or network traffic may be distributed among cores according to any type and form of data parallelism . In some embodiments data parallelism may be achieved in a multi core system by each core performing the same task or functionally on different pieces of distributed data. In some embodiments a single execution thread or code controls operations on all pieces of data. In other embodiments different threads or instructions control the operation but may execute the same code. In some embodiments data parallelism is achieved from the perspective of a packet engine vServers VIPs A C network interface cards NIC D E and or any other networking hardware or software included on or associated with an appliance . For example each core may run the same packet engine or VIP code or configuration but operate on different sets of distributed data. Each networking hardware or software construct can receive different varying or substantially the same amount of data and as a result may have varying different or relatively the same amount of load .

In the case of a data parallelism approach the work may be divided up and distributed based on VIPs NICs and or data flows of the VIPs or NICs. In one of these approaches the work of the multi core system may be divided or distributed among the VIPs by having each VIP work on a distributed set of data. For example each core may be configured to run one or more VIPs. Network traffic may be distributed to the core for each VIP handling that traffic. In another of these approaches the work of the appliance may be divided or distributed among the cores based on which NIC receives the network traffic. For example network traffic of a first NIC may be distributed to a first core while network traffic of a second NIC may be distributed to a second core. In some cases a core may process data from multiple NICs.

While illustrates a single vServer associated with a single core as is the case for VIP1 A VIP2 B and VIP3 C. In some embodiments a single vServer can be associated with one or more cores . In contrast one or more vServers can be associated with a single core . Associating a vServer with a core may include that core to process all functions associated with that particular vServer. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code and configuration. In other embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code but different configuration. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having different code and the same or different configuration.

Like vServers NICs can also be associated with particular cores . In many embodiments NICs can be connected to one or more cores such that when a NIC receives or transmits data packets a particular core handles the processing involved with receiving and transmitting the data packets. In one embodiment a single NIC can be associated with a single core as is the case with NIC1 D and NIC2 E. In other embodiments one or more NICs can be associated with a single core . In other embodiments a single NIC can be associated with one or more cores . In these embodiments load could be distributed amongst the one or more cores such that each core processes a substantially similar amount of load. A core associated with a NIC may process all functions and or data associated with that particular NIC.

While distributing work across cores based on data of VIPs or NICs may have a level of independency in some embodiments this may lead to unbalanced use of cores as illustrated by the varying loads of .

In some embodiments load work or network traffic can be distributed among cores based on any type and form of data flow. In another of these approaches the work may be divided or distributed among cores based on data flows. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approaches.

In flow based data parallelism distribution of data is related to any type of flow of data such as request response pairings transactions sessions connections or application communications. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. The distribution of data flow may be such that each core carries a substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed amount of load data or network traffic.

In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approached. In one embodiment data flow can be distributed based on a transaction or a series of transactions. This transaction in some embodiments can be between a client and a server and can be characterized by an IP address or other packet identifier. For example Core 1 A can be dedicated to transactions between a particular client and a particular server therefore the load A on Core 1 A may be comprised of the network traffic associated with the transactions between the particular client and server. Allocating the network traffic to Core 1 A can be accomplished by routing all data packets originating from either the particular client or server to Core 1 A.

While work or load can be distributed to the cores based in part on transactions in other embodiments load or work can be allocated on a per packet basis. In these embodiments the appliance can intercept data packets and allocate them to a core having the least amount of load. For example the appliance could allocate a first incoming data packet to Core 1 A because the load A on Core 1 is less than the load B N on the rest of the cores B N. Once the first data packet is allocated to Core 1 A the amount of load A on Core 1 A is increased proportional to the amount of processing resources needed to process the first data packet. When the appliance intercepts a second data packet the appliance will allocate the load to Core 4 D because Core 4 D has the second least amount of load. Allocating data packets to the core with the least amount of load can in some embodiments ensure that the load A N distributed to each core remains substantially equal.

In other embodiments load can be allocated on a per unit basis where a section of network traffic is allocated to a particular core . The above mentioned example illustrates load balancing on a per packet basis. In other embodiments load can be allocated based on a number of packets such that every 10 100 or 1000 packets are allocated to the core having the least amount of load. The number of packets allocated to a core can be a number determined by an application user or administrator and can be any number greater than zero. In still other embodiments load can be allocated based on a time metric such that packets are distributed to a particular core for a predetermined amount of time. In these embodiments packets can be distributed to a particular core for five milliseconds or for any period of time determined by a user program system administrator or otherwise. After the predetermined time period elapses data packets are transmitted to a different core for the predetermined period of time.

Flow based data parallelism methods for distributing work load or network traffic among the one or more cores can comprise any combination of the above mentioned embodiments. These methods can be carried out by any part of the appliance by an application or set of executable instructions executing on one of the cores such as the packet engine or by any application program or agent executing on a computing device in communication with the appliance .

The functional and data parallelism computing schemes illustrated in can be combined in any manner to generate a hybrid parallelism or distributed processing scheme that encompasses function parallelism data parallelism flow based data parallelism or any portions thereof. In some cases the multi core system may use any type and form of load balancing schemes to distribute load among the one or more cores . The load balancing scheme may be used in any combination with any of the functional and data parallelism schemes or combinations thereof.

The packet engine s A N can in some embodiments be associated with a particular server user client or network. When a packet engine becomes associated with a particular entity that packet engine can process data packets associated with that entity. For example should a packet engine be associated with a first user that packet engine will process and operate on packets generated by the first user or packets having a destination address associated with the first user. Similarly the packet engine may choose not to be associated with a particular entity such that the packet engine can process and otherwise operate on any data packets not generated by that entity or destined for that entity.

Each core A N in one embodiment can be associated with a particular packet engine such that load balancing can be carried out by the packet engine. Load balancing may in this embodiment require that each packet engine A N associated with a core communicate with the other packet engines associated with cores so that the packet engines A N can collectively determine where to distribute load. One embodiment of this process can include an arbiter that receives votes from each packet engine for load. The arbiter can distribute load to each packet engine A N based in part on the age of the engine s vote and in some cases a priority value associated with the current amount of load on an engine s associated core .

A core may have or use memory that is shared or assigned to multiple cores. The memory may be considered public or shared memory that is accessible by more than one core. A core may use any combination of private and public memory. With separate address spaces for each core some level of coordination is eliminated from the case of using the same address space. With a separate address space a core can perform work on information and data in the core s own address space without worrying about conflicts with other cores. Each packet engine may have a separate memory pool for TCP and or SSL connections.

Instead of the functionality of the cores being deployed in the form of a physical processor such functionality may be deployed in a virtualized environment on any computing device such as a client server or appliance . In other embodiments instead of the functionality of the cores being deployed in the form of an appliance or a single device the functionality may be deployed across multiple devices in any arrangement. For example one device may comprise two or more cores and another device may comprise two or more cores. For example a multi core system may include a cluster of computing devices a server farm or network of computing devices. In some embodiments instead of the functionality of the cores being deployed in the form of cores the functionality may be deployed on a plurality of processors such as a plurality of single core processors.

In one embodiment the cores may be any type and form of processor. In some embodiments a core can function substantially similar to any processor or central processing unit described herein.

In embodiments where the system comprises one or more flow distributors each flow distributor can be associated with a processor or a packet engine . The flow distributors can comprise an interface mechanism that allows each flow distributor to communicate with the other flow distributors executing within the system . In one instance the one or more flow distributors can determine how to balance load by communicating with each other. This process can operate substantially similarly to the process described above for submitting votes to an arbiter which then determines which flow distributor should receive the load. In other embodiments a first flow distributor can identify the load on an associated core and determine whether to forward a first data packet to the associated core based on any of the following criteria the load on the associated core is above a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is below a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is less than the load on the other cores or any other metric that can be used to determine where to forward data packets based in part on the amount of load on a processor.

In this embodiment each instance of the flow distributor can communicate with other instances of the flow distributor to forward packets back and forth across the cores . There exist situations where a response to a request packet may not be processed by the same core i.e. the first core processes the request while the second core processes the response. In these situations the instances of the flow distributor can intercept the packet and forward it to the desired or correct core i.e. a flow distributor instance can forward the response to the first core. Multiple instances of the flow distributor can execute on any number of cores and any combination of cores .

The flow distributor may operate responsive to any one or more rules or policies. The rules may identify a core or packet processing engine to receive a network packet data or data flow. The rules may identify any type and form of tuple information related to a network packet such as a 4 tuple of source and destination IP address and source and destination ports. Based on a received packet matching the tuple specified by the rule the flow distributor may forward the packet to a core or packet engine. In some embodiments the packet is forwarded to a core via shared memory and or core to core messaging.

Although illustrates the flow distributor as executing within the multi core system in some embodiments the flow distributor can execute on a computing device or appliance remotely located from the multi core system . In such an embodiment the flow distributor can communicate with the multi core system to take in data packets and distribute the packets across the one or more cores . The flow distributor can in one embodiment receive data packets destined for the appliance apply a distribution scheme to the received data packets and distribute the data packets to the one or more cores of the multi core system . In one embodiment the flow distributor can be included in a router or other appliance such that the router can target particular cores by altering meta data associated with each packet so that each packet is targeted towards a sub node of the multi core system . In such an embodiment CISCO s vn tag mechanism can be used to alter or tag each packet with the appropriate meta data.

Illustrated in is an embodiment of a multi core system comprising one or more processing cores A N. In brief overview one of the cores can be designated as a control core A and can be used as a control plane for the other cores . The other cores may be secondary cores which operate in a data plane while the control core provides the control plane. The cores A N may share a global cache . While the control core provides a control plane the other cores in the multi core system form or provide a data plane. These cores perform data processing functionality on network traffic while the control provides initialization configuration and control of the multi core system.

Further referring to and in more detail the cores A N as well as the control core A can be any processor described herein. Furthermore the cores A N and the control core A can be any processor able to function within the system described in . Still further the cores A N and the control core A can be any core or group of cores described herein. The control core may be a different type of core or processor than the other cores. In some embodiments the control may operate a different packet engine or have a packet engine configured differently than the packet engines of the other cores.

Any portion of the memory of each of the cores may be allocated to or used for a global cache that is shared by the cores. In brief overview a predetermined percentage or predetermined amount of each of the memory of each core may be used for the global cache. For example 50 of each memory of each code may be dedicated or allocated to the shared global cache. That is in the illustrated embodiment 2 GB of each core excluding the control plane core or core 1 may be used to form a 28 GB shared global cache. The configuration of the control plane such as via the configuration services may determine the amount of memory used for the shared global cache. In some embodiments each core may provide a different amount of memory for use by the global cache. In other embodiments any one core may not provide any memory or use the global cache. In some embodiments any of the cores may also have a local cache in memory not allocated to the global shared memory. Each of the cores may store any portion of network traffic to the global shared cache. Each of the cores may check the cache for any content to use in a request or response. Any of the cores may obtain content from the global shared cache to use in a data flow request or response.

The global cache can be any type and form of memory or storage element such as any memory or storage element described herein. In some embodiments the cores may have access to a predetermined amount of memory i.e. 32 GB or any other memory amount commensurate with the system . The global cache can be allocated from that predetermined amount of memory while the rest of the available memory can be allocated among the cores . In other embodiments each core can have a predetermined amount of memory. The global cache can comprise an amount of the memory allocated to each core . This memory amount can be measured in bytes or can be measured as a percentage of the memory allocated to each core . Thus the global cache can comprise 1 GB of memory from the memory associated with each core or can comprise 20 percent or one half of the memory associated with each core . In some embodiments only a portion of the cores provide memory to the global cache while in other embodiments the global cache can comprise memory not allocated to the cores .

Each core can use the global cache to store network traffic or cache data. In some embodiments the packet engines of the core use the global cache to cache and use data stored by the plurality of packet engines. For example the cache manager of and cache functionality of may use the global cache to share data for acceleration. For example each of the packet engines may store responses such as HTML data to the global cache. Any of the cache managers operating on a core may access the global cache to server caches responses to client requests.

In some embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store a port allocation table which can be used to determine data flow based in part on ports. In other embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store an address lookup table or any other table or list that can be used by the flow distributor to determine where to direct incoming and outgoing data packets. The cores can in some embodiments read from and write to cache while in other embodiments the cores can only read from or write to cache . The cores may use the global cache to perform core to core communications.

The global cache may be sectioned into individual memory sections where each section can be dedicated to a particular core . In one embodiment the control core A can receive a greater amount of available cache while the other cores can receiving varying amounts or access to the global cache .

In some embodiments the system can comprise a control core A. While illustrates core 1 A as the control core the control core can be any core within the appliance or multi core system. Further while only a single control core is depicted the system can comprise one or more control cores each having a level of control over the system. In some embodiments one or more control cores can each control a particular aspect of the system . For example one core can control deciding which distribution scheme to use while another core can determine the size of the global cache .

The control plane of the multi core system may be the designation and configuration of a core as the dedicated management core or as a master core. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of operation and functionality the plurality of cores in the multi core system. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of allocation and use of memory of the system among the plurality of cores in the multi core system including initialization and configuration of the same. In some embodiments the control plane includes the flow distributor for controlling the assignment of data flows to cores and the distribution of network packets to cores based on data flows. In some embodiments the control plane core runs a packet engine and in other embodiments the control plane core is dedicated to management and control of the other cores of the system.

The control core A can exercise a level of control over the other cores such as determining how much memory should be allocated to each core or determining which core should be assigned to handle a particular function or hardware software entity. The control core A in some embodiments can exercise control over those cores within the control plan . Thus there can exist processors outside of the control plane which are not controlled by the control core A. Determining the boundaries of the control plane can include maintaining by the control core A or agent executing within the system a list of those cores controlled by the control core A. The control core A can control any of the following initialization of a core determining when a core is unavailable re distributing load to other cores when one core fails determining which distribution scheme to implement determining which core should receive network traffic determining how much cache should be allocated to each core determining whether to assign a particular function or element to a particular core determining whether to permit cores to communicate with one another determining the size of the global cache and any other determination of a function configuration or operation of the cores within the system .

Referring now to an embodiment of steps of a method for maintaining a source IP address of a client request received from a cache server upon a cache miss by the cache server is illustrated. At step an intermediary network device receives from a client a request destined to server where the request identifies an IP address of the client as the source IP address. At step the intermediary determines that the client request is for content that may be cached by the cache server . At step the intermediary transmits to the cache server the client request as a cache request which is modified to include the IP address of the client in the header of cache request. At step the intermediary receives from the cache server a returned cache request in response to a cache miss by the cache server. The returned cache request includes the client IP address in the header and a source IP address that is modified by the cache server . At step the intermediary obtains the client IP address from the header of the cache request in response to a policy . At step the intermediary transmits to the destination server the client request that includes the IP address of the client as the source IP address of the client request.

At step an intermediary device receives from a client a client request destined for server and identifying the IP address of the client as the source IP address. The client request may be received via a transport layer connection between the client and intermediary device. The intermediary device may receive a plurality of requests from one or more clients. In some embodiments the intermediary receives the request via an established transport layer connection such as a TCP connection. In other embodiments the intermediary receives the request via an established session to a client or a session between a client and a server . The client request may request for a particular type and form of content or service provided by server . The client request may comprise a URL for a particular page which may further identify one or more objects to be received by the requesting client. In some embodiments the content requested by the client request includes any type and form of web content such as the HTTP HTML XML audio video graphics presentation data stream or any type and form of service or application content.

At step intermediary determines that the client request is for content that may be cached. In some embodiments intermediary parses the client request. The intermediary may identify via parsing that a portion of the request references a webpage a file a picture a video or audio stream a graphical feature a portion of text or a document. The intermediary may determine that a portion of the request such as the URL a portion of the text a document or an object identifies content that may be cached. Intermediary may determine that any portion of the client request identifies components which may be stored or cached at a cache server . The intermediary may make a determination using a compression history or history of the network traffic traversed. In some embodiments the intermediary maintains a communication with the cache server and receives information from the cache server to be used to identify the content that may be cached. In some embodiments the intermediary may determine that the client request may be for cacheable content based on one or more policies.

At step the cache redirector modifies the client request to include the IP address of the client from the source of the client request into the header of the client request and transmits the modified client request to the cache server as a cache request. Intermediary may transmit to cache server the client request via a connection established between intermediary and cache server . The cache redirector may transmit the modified client request as the cache request via a second transport layer connection between the intermediary and the cache server while the intermediary previous received the client request via a first transport layer connection between the intermediary and the client. In some embodiments the client request is modified and transmitted to the cache server as the cache request in response to the determination at step that the client request is for the content that may be cached.

The cache request may be the modified client request to include the IP address in the portion of the client request such as the header or the body. In some embodiments the cache request is a network packet that encloses or includes the client request. The cache redirector may store or write a source IP address and or a destination IP address from the original client request into the header of the cache request. In some embodiments cache redirector copies the IP address from the source of the client request and or from the destination of the client request into a portion of the client request prior to forwarding the request to the cache server as the cache request. In certain embodiments the client IP address is obtained from the source IP location of the client request and written in a portion of the header a portion of the body or a portion of the payload of the cache request. The client IP address may be stored in or written into a TCP header. In some embodiments the client IP address is stored or written into a header of an application layer protocol. For example the cache request may be modified to include the client IP address in an HTTP header. In some embodiments the client IP address is included in an X forward header or X real ip header of an HTTP request.

The client IP address may be entered into the cache request or the client request in the form of numbers characters string of characters or any other format. The client IP address may be included into a second request such as a cache request which may comprise the client request. In some embodiments cache redirector inserts or writes the IP address from the source of the client request into a header of the cache request which comprises or envelops the client request. The cache redirector may forward the cache request to the cache server .

At step the intermediary receives from the cache server a returned or a missed cache request. The intermediary device may determine the request is from the cache server based on the port that the request is received. For example a port number or range of numbers may be designed as a cache proxy port. In other embodiments the intermediary device may determine the request is from the cache based on any tuple information about the connection. The returned or the missed cache request may be received by the intermediary via a third transport layer connection between the cache server and the intermediary . The cache request may comprise the client request. In some embodiments the cache request is a client request modified to include the client IP address in a header of the client request. The returned or missed cache request may be the client request modified by the cache server . The modified client request may be modified by the cache server to include an IP address of the intermediary as the source IP address. The modified client request may further comprise the client IP address written in the header of the request or the body of the request. In some embodiments the returned or missed cache request is the cache request from the step which has been modified by the cache server to include the IP address of the intermediary as the source IP address. The cache request may further comprise the client IP address stored in the header of the cache server modified cache request. The client request may be returned from the cache server to the intermediary whenever the cache server upon receiving the request for content requested by the client request is not able to provide the content requested. The returned cache request may be returned to the intermediary in response to a cache miss by the cache server . The cache request may be not implemented or may be missed due to any number of reasons. In some embodiments the cache is missed because the content requested by the client request is not cached by the cache server . In some embodiments the cache is missed because the cache server determines that the content requested is expired outdated or invalid. In some embodiments the cache is missed because the content is damaged or corrupted. In further embodiments the cache is missed because the cache server is incapable of servicing the request. The cache server may maintain the client IP address in the same header as provided by the intermediary. In other embodiments the cache server may write or store the client IP address in a different header.

At step the intermediary obtains the client IP address stored in the cache request received from the cache server . In some embodiments a policy initiates an action by the cache redirector to obtain the client IP address from the received cache request in response to a policy . A rule of the policy such as an expression may be evaluated in order to identify parser or extract the client IP address from the request received from the cache.

The policy may further specify to replace the source IP address of the cache request with the client IP address to form a request to send to the destination server. The policy may initiate or specify other functions to modify the cache request to resemble the client request which was originally received from the client . The client IP address may be obtained in response to the policy in order to restore the client IP address the source IP address and thereby maintain the source IP address as originally received at step . In some embodiments upon obtaining the client IP address stored in the header of the cache request the cache redirector modifies the cache request to include the source IP address from the header of the cache request into the source of the cache server modified cache request. Similarly the cache redirector may modify the cache request received from the cache server to include the destination IP address stored in the header of the client request into the destination of the client request or the cache request. Intermediary may modify the cache request to resemble the client request as was received by the intermediary at step .

At step the intermediary transmits to the destination server the client request that includes the IP address of the client as the source IP address of the client request. The client request may include the cache request modified to include the client IP address stored in the header or the body of the cache request as the source IP address of the client request. The client request may include the cache request modified to include the destination IP address which was stored or written in the header of the body of the request as the destination IP address of the request. Intermediary may transmit the client request to the destination server upon ensuring that the source IP address and or the destination IP address are modified to reflect their original settings. The client request may be transmitted to the destination server via a transport layer connection between to the intermediary and server referred to as a fourth transport layer connection. The client IP address may be stored in or written into a TCP header of the request sent to the destination. In some embodiments the client IP address is stored or written into a header of an application layer protocol of the request sent to the destination. For example the cache request may be modified to include the client IP address in an HTTP header. In some embodiments the client IP address is included in an X forward header or X real ip header of an HTTP request sent to destination.

In one embodiment an intermediary network device receives from a client of a plurality of clients a client request. The intermediary device may receive the client request via a transport layer connection between the client and the intermediary network device. The client request may include a network packet that comprises an information identifying a particular content such as a URL an object a file name or file path a document name or any other type and form of content identifying information. The intermediary device may monitor or review or parse the requests such as the client request. Upon review monitoring or parsing of the client request the intermediary device may determine that the client request is requesting a content which may be stored on a cache server. The cache redirector may comprise configurations and or policies to modify the client request to include the source IP address of the client request into the header of the client request. The cache request may in response to the determination that the client request is for the content that may be cached forward the modified client request to the cache server.

The cache server may return the client request to the intermediary network device upon determining that the cache server is not able to provide the content requested by the client request. In some embodiments the cache server may modify change or replace the source IP address of the client request. Therefore the client request received by the intermediary device from the cache server may include a source IP address which was not the same source IP address that was received by the intermediary from the client. However since the original source IP address has been stored in the header of the client request by the cache redirector the original source IP address may still be preserved despite being modified by the cache server.

Referring now to an embodiment of a system for maintaining a transparent end to end cache redirection via an intermediary device is illustrated. In some embodiments relates to system for maintaining an internet protocol address of a destination server while performing cache redirection by an intermediary network device.
