title: Devices and methods for non-invasive capacitive electrical stimulation and their use for vagus nerve stimulation on the neck of a patient
abstract: A non-invasive electrical stimulator shapes an elongated electric field of effect that can be oriented parallel to a long nerve, such as a vagus nerve in a patient's neck, producing a desired physiological response in the patient. The stimulator comprises a source of electrical power, at least one electrode and a continuous electrically conducting medium in contact with the electrodes. The conducting medium is also in contact with an interface element that may conform to the contour of a target body surface of the patient when the interface element is applied to that surface. When the interface element is made of insulating (dielectric) material, and disclosed stimulation waveforms are used, the power source need not supply high voltage, in order to capacitively stimulate the target nerve. The stimulator is configured to produce a peak pulse that is sufficient to produce a physiologically effective electric field in the vicinity of a target nerve, but not to substantially stimulate other nerves and muscles that lie in the vicinity of the target nerve and patient's skin.

The present application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 13 183 765 filed 15 Jul. 2011 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 874 227 issued Oct. 28 2014 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 488 208 filed May 20 2011.

This application is also a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 075 746 filed Mar. 30 2011 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 874 205 issued Oct. 28 2014 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 451 259 filed 10 Mar. 2011. Each of the foregoing is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The field of the present invention relates to the delivery of energy impulses and or fields to bodily tissues for therapeutic purposes. It relates more specifically to the use of non invasive devices and methods particularly transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation devices that make use of capacitive electrical coupling as well as methods of treating patients using energy that is delivered by such devices. The disclosed methods and devices may be used to stimulate the vagus nerve of a patient to treat many conditions such as headaches including migraine and cluster headaches rhinitis and sinusitis depression and anxiety disorder post operative ileus dysfunction associated with TNF alpha in Alzheimer s disease postoperative cognitive dysfunction postoperative delirium rheumatoid arthritis asthmatic bronchoconstriction urinary incontinence and or overactive bladder and sphincter of Oddi dysfunction as well as neurodegenerative diseases more generally including Alzheimer s disease and its precursor mild cognitive impairment MCI Parkinson s disease including Parkinson s disease dementia and multiple sclerosis.

Treatments for various infirmities sometime require the destruction of otherwise healthy tissue in order to produce a beneficial effect. Malfunctioning tissue is identified and then lesioned or otherwise compromised in order to produce a beneficial outcome rather than attempting to repair the tissue to its normal functionality. A variety of techniques and mechanisms have been designed to produce focused lesions directly in target nerve tissue but collateral damage is inevitable.

Other treatments for malfunctioning tissue can be medicinal in nature but in many cases the patients become dependent upon artificially synthesized chemicals. In many cases these medicinal approaches have side effects that are either unknown or quite significant. Unfortunately the beneficial outcomes of surgery and medicines are often realized at the cost of function of other tissues or risks of side effects.

The use of electrical stimulation for treatment of medical conditions has been well known in the art for nearly two thousand years. It has been recognized that electrical stimulation of the brain and or the peripheral nervous system and or direct stimulation of the malfunctioning tissue holds significant promise for the treatment of many ailments because such stimulation is generally a wholly reversible and non destructive treatment.

Nerve stimulation is thought to be accomplished directly or indirectly by depolarizing a nerve membrane causing the discharge of an action potential or by hyperpolarization of a nerve membrane preventing the discharge of an action potential. Such stimulation may occur after electrical energy or also other forms of energy are transmitted to the vicinity of a nerve F. RATTAY. The basic mechanism for the electrical stimulation of the nervous system. Neuroscience 89 2 1999 335 346 Thomas HEIMBURG and Andrew D. Jackson. On soliton propagation in biomembranes and nerves. PNAS 102 28 2005 9790 9795 . Nerve stimulation may be measured directly as an increase decrease or modulation of the activity of nerve fibers or it may be inferred from the physiological effects that follow the transmission of energy to the nerve fibers.

One of the most successful applications of modern understanding of the electrophysiological relationship between muscle and nerves is the cardiac pacemaker. Although origins of the cardiac pacemaker extend back into the 1800 s it was not until 1950 that the first practical albeit external and bulky pacemaker was developed. The first truly functional wearable pacemaker appeared in 1957 and in 1960 the first fully implantable pacemaker was developed.

Around this time it was also found that electrical leads could be connected to the heart through veins which eliminated the need to open the chest cavity and attach the lead to the heart wall. In 1975 the introduction of the lithium iodide battery prolonged the battery life of a pacemaker from a few months to more than a decade. The modern pacemaker can treat a variety of different signaling pathologies in the cardiac muscle and can serve as a defibrillator as well see U.S. Pat. No. 6 738 667 to DENO et al. the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference .

Another application of electrical stimulation of nerves has been the treatment of radiating pain in the lower extremities by stimulating the sacral nerve roots at the bottom of the spinal cord see U.S. Pat. No. 6 871 099 to WHITEHURST et al. the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference .

Electrical stimulation of the brain with implanted electrodes has also been approved for use in the treatment of various conditions including movement disorders such as essential tremor and Parkinson s disease. The principle underlying these approaches involves disruption and modulation of hyperactive neuronal circuit transmission at specific sites in the brain. Unlike potentially dangerous lesioning procedures in which aberrant portions of the brain are physically destroyed electrical stimulation is achieved by implanting electrodes at these sites. The electrodes are used first to sense aberrant electrical signals and then to send electrical pulses to locally disrupt pathological neuronal transmission driving it back into the normal range of activity. These electrical stimulation procedures while invasive are generally conducted with the patient conscious and a participant in the surgery.

However brain stimulation and deep brain stimulation in particular is not without some drawbacks. The procedure requires penetrating the skull and inserting an electrode into brain matter using a catheter shaped lead or the like. While monitoring the patient s condition such as tremor activity etc. the position of the electrode is adjusted to achieve significant therapeutic potential. Next adjustments are made to the electrical stimulus signals such as frequency periodicity voltage current etc. again to achieve therapeutic results. The electrode is then permanently implanted and wires are directed from the electrode to the site of a surgically implanted pacemaker. The pacemaker provides the electrical stimulus signals to the electrode to maintain the therapeutic effect. While the therapeutic results of deep brain stimulation are promising significant complications may arise from the implantation procedure including stroke induced by damage to surrounding tissues and the neuro vasculature.

Most of the above mentioned applications of electrical stimulation involve the surgical implantation of electrodes within a patient. In contrast for embodiments of the present invention the disclosed devices and medical procedures stimulate nerves by transmitting energy to nerves and tissue non invasively. They may offer the patient an alternative that does not involve surgery. A medical procedure is defined as being non invasive when no break in the skin or other surface of the body such as a wound bed is created through use of the method and when there is no contact with an internal body cavity beyond a body orifice e.g beyond the mouth or beyond the external auditory meatus of the ear . Such non invasive procedures are distinguished from invasive procedures including minimally invasive procedures in that invasive procedures do involve inserting a substance or device into or through the skin or into an internal body cavity beyond a body orifice. For example transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation TENS is non invasive because it involves attaching electrodes to the surface of the skin or using a form fitting conductive garment without breaking the skin. In contrast percutaneous electrical stimulation of a nerve is minimally invasive because it involves the introduction of an electrode under the skin via needle puncture of the skin see commonly assigned co pending US Patent Application 2010 0241188 entitled Percutaneous Electrical Treatment of Tissue to ERRICO et al which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety .

Potential advantages of non invasive medical methods and devices relative to comparable invasive procedures are as follows. The patient may be more psychologically prepared to experience a procedure that is non invasive and may therefore be more cooperative resulting in a better outcome. Non invasive procedures may avoid damage of biological tissues such as that due to bleeding infection skin or internal organ injury blood vessel injury and vein or lung blood clotting. Non invasive procedures generally present fewer problems with biocompatibility. In cases involving the attachment of electrodes non invasive methods have less of a tendency for breakage of leads and the electrodes can be easily repositioned if necessary. Non invasive methods are sometimes painless or only minimally painful and may be performed without the need for even local anesthesia. Less training may be required for use of non invasive procedures by medical professionals. In view of the reduced risk ordinarily associated with non invasive procedures some such procedures may be suitable for use by the patient or family members at home or by first responders at home or at a workplace and the cost of non invasive procedures may be reduced relative to comparable invasive procedures.

Electrodes that are applied non invasively to the surface of the body have a long history including electrodes that were used to stimulate underlying nerves L. A. GEDDES. Historical Evolution of Circuit Models for the Electrode Electrolyte Interface. Annals of Biomedical Engineering 25 1997 1 14 . However electrical stimulation of nerves in general fell into disfavor in middle of the twentieth century until the gate theory of pain was introduced by Melzack and Wall in 1965. This theory along with advances in electronics reawakened interest in the use of implanted electrodes to stimulate nerves initially to control pain. Screening procedures were then developed to determine suitable candidates for electrode implantation which involved first determining whether the patient responded when stimulated with electrodes applied to the surface of the body in the vicinity of the possible implant. It was subsequently found that the surface stimulation often controlled pain so well that there was no need to implant a stimulating electrode Charles Burton and Donald D. Maurer. Pain Suppression by Transcutaneous Electronic Stimulation. IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering BME 21 2 1974 81 88 . Such non invasive transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation TENS was then developed for treating different types of pain including pain in a joint or lower back cancer pain post operative pain post traumatic pain and pain associated with labor and delivery Steven E.

As TENS was being developed to treat pain non invasive electrical stimulation using surface electrodes was simultaneously developed for additional therapeutic or diagnostic purposes which are known collectively as electrotherapy. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation NMES stimulates normally innervated muscle in an effort to augment strength and endurance of normal e.g. athletic or damaged e.g. spastic muscle. Functional electrical stimulation FES is used to activate nerves innervating muscle affected by paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury head injury stroke and other neurological disorders or muscle affected by foot drop and gait disorders. FES is also used to stimulate muscle as an orthotic substitute e.g. replace a brace or support in scoliosis management. Another application of surface electrical stimulation is chest to back stimulation of tissue such as emergency defibrillation and cardiac pacing. Surface electrical stimulation has also been used to repair tissue by increasing circulation through vasodilation by controlling edema by healing wounds and by inducing bone growth. Surface electrical stimulation is also used for iontophoresis in which electrical currents drive electrically charged drugs or other ions into the skin usually to treat inflammation and pain arthritis wounds or scars. Stimulation with surface electrodes is also used to evoke a response for diagnostic purposes for example in peripheral nerve stimulation PNS that evaluates the ability of motor and sensory nerves to conduct and produce reflexes. Surface electrical stimulation is also used in electroconvulsive therapy to treat psychiatric disorders electroanesthesia for example to prevent pain from dental procedures and electrotactile speech processing to convert sound into tactile sensation for the hearing impaired. All of the above mentioned applications of surface electrode stimulation are intended not to damage the patient but if higher currents are used with special electrodes electrosurgery may be performed as a means to cut coagulate desiccate or fulgurate tissue Mark R.

Despite its attractiveness non invasive electrical stimulation of a nerve is not always possible or practical. This is primarily because the current state of the art may not be able to stimulate a deep nerve selectively or without producing excessive pain since the stimulation may unintentionally stimulate nerves other than the nerve of interest including nerves that cause pain. For this reason forms of electrical stimulation other than TENS may be best suited for the treatment of particular types of pain Paul F. WHITE Shitong Li and Jen W. Chiu.

For some other electrotherapeutic applications it has also been difficult to perform non invasive stimulation of a nerve in lieu of stimulating that nerve invasively. The therapies most relevant to the present invention involve electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve in the neck in order to treat epilepsy depression and other medical conditions. For these therapies the left vagus nerve is ordinarily stimulated at a location within the neck by first surgically implanting an electrode there then connecting the electrode to an electrical stimulator U.S. Pat.

When it is desired to avoid the surgical implantation of an electrode vagal nerve stimulation VNS may be performed less invasively by positioning one or more electrodes in the esophagus trachea or jugular vein but with one electrode positioned on the surface of the body U.S. Pat. No. 7 340 299 entitled Methods of indirectly stimulating the vagus nerve to achieve controlled asystole to PUSKAS and U.S. Pat. No. 7 869 884 entitled Non surgical device and methods for trans esophageal vagus nerve stimulation to SCOTT et al . Despite their advantage as being non surgical such methods nevertheless exhibit other disadvantages associated with invasive procedures.

In other patents non invasive VNS is disclosed but at a location other than in the neck e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 865 048 entitled Method and apparatus for drug free neurostimulation to ECKERSON U.S. Pat. No. 6 609 025 entitled Treatment of obesity by bilateral sub diaphragmatic nerve stimulation to BARRETT et al U.S. Pat. No. 5 458 625 entitled Transcutaneous nerve stimulation device and method for using same to KENDALL U.S. Pat. No. 7 386 347 entitled Electric stimulator for alpha wave derivation to Chung et al. U.S. Pat. No. 7 797 042 entitled Device for applying a transcutaneous stimulus or for transcutaneous measuring of a parameter to Dietrich et al. patent application US2010 0057154 entitled Device and Method for the Transdermal Stimulation of a Nerve of the Human Body to Dietrich et al US2006 0122675 entitled Stimulator for auricular branch of vagus nerve to Libbus et al US2008 0288016 entitled Systems and Methods for Stimulating Neural Targets to Amurthur et al . However because such non invasive VNS occurs at a location other than the neck it is not directly comparable to invasive VNS in the neck for which therapeutic results are well documented. Among other patents and patent applications non invasive VNS is sometimes mentioned along with invasive VNS methods but without addressing the problem of unintentional stimulation of nerves other than the vagus nerve particularly nerves that cause pain e.g. US20080208266 entitled System and Method for Treating Nausea and Vomiting by Vagus Nerve Stimulation to LESSER et al . Other patents are vague as to how non invasive electrical stimulation in the vicinity of the vagus nerve in the neck is to be accomplished e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 7 499 747 entitled External baroreflex activation to KIEVAL et al .

In view of the foregoing background there is a long felt but unsolved need to stimulate the vagus nerve electrically in the neck totally non invasively selectively and essentially without producing pain. As compared with what would have been experienced by a patient undergoing non invasive stimulation with conventional TENS methods the vagal nerve stimulator should produce relatively little pain for a given depth of stimulus penetration. Or conversely for a given amount of pain or discomfort on the part of the patient e.g. the threshold at which such discomfort or pain begins an objective of the present invention is to achieve a greater depth of penetration of the stimulus under the skin. Furthermore an objective is not to stimulate other nerves and muscle that lie near the vagus nerve in the neck but to nevertheless to stimulate the vagus nerve to achieve therapeutic results.

Non invasive capacitive stimulating electrodes which contact the patient s skin with a dielectric material are thought to produce more uniform current densities than electrodes made of electrically conducting material. Their use may therefore be advantageous as a method to avoid potential pain when a patient is electrically stimulated. However previous capacitive stimulating electrodes have required the use of a high voltage power supply which is accompanied by the inherent danger of high voltage breakdowns of the electrode s dielectric material L. A. GEDDES M. Hinds and K. S. Foster. Stimulation with capacitor electrodes. Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing 25 1987 359 360 Thierry KELLER and Andreas Kuhn. Electrodes for transcutaneous surface electrical stimulation. Journal of Automatic Control University of Belgrade 18 2 2008 35 45 U.S. Pat. No. 3 077 884 entitled Electro physiotherapy apparatus to BARTROW et al and U.S. Pat. No. 4 144 893 entitled Neuromuscular therapy device to HICKEY . Therefore it is yet a further objective of the present invention to have a capacitive stimulating device that does not require the use of a high voltage power supply.

In one aspect of the invention devices and methods are described to produce therapeutic effects in a patient by utilizing an energy source that transmits energy non invasively to nervous tissue. In particular the disclosed devices can transmit energy to or in close proximity to a vagus nerve in the neck of the patient in order to temporarily stimulate block and or modulate electrophysiological signals in that nerve. The methods that are disclosed herein comprise stimulating the vagus nerve with particular stimulation waveform parameters preferably using the nerve stimulator devices that are also described herein.

A novel stimulator device is used to modulate electrical activity of a vagus nerve or other nerves or tissue. The stimulator comprises a source of electrical power and two or more remote electrodes that are configured to stimulate a deep nerve relative to the nerve axis. The device also comprises continuous electrically conducting media with which the electrodes are in contact. The conducting medium is also in contact with an interface element that makes physical contact with the patient s skin. The interface element may be electrically insulating dielectric material such as a sheet of Mylar in which case electrical coupling of the device to the patient is capacitive. In other embodiments the interface element is electrically conducting material such as an electrically conducting or permeable membrane in which case electrical coupling of the device to the patient is ohmic. The interface element may have a shape that conforms to the contour of a target body surface of a patient when the medium is applied to the target body surface.

For the present medical applications the device is ordinarily applied to the patient s neck. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the stimulator comprises two electrodes that lie side by side within separate stimulator heads wherein the electrodes are separated by electrically insulating material. Each electrode is in continuous contact with an electrically conducting medium that extends from the interface element of the stimulator to the electrode. The interface element also contacts the patient s skin when the device is in operation. The conducting media for different electrodes are also separated by electrically insulating material.

The source of power supplies a pulse of electric charge to the electrodes such that the electrodes produce an electric current and or an electric field within the patient. The stimulator is configured to induce a peak pulse voltage sufficient to produce an electric field in the vicinity of a nerve such as a vagus nerve to cause the nerve to depolarize and reach a threshold for action potential propagation. By way of example the threshold electric field for stimulation of the nerve may be about 8 V m at 1000 Hz. For example the device may produce an electric field within the patient of about 10 to 600 V m and an electrical field gradient of greater than 2 V m mm.

Current passing through an electrode may be about 0 to 40 mA with voltage across the electrodes of 0 to 30 volts. The current is passed through the electrodes in bursts of pulses. There may be 1 to 20 pulses per burst preferably five pulses. Each pulse within a burst has a duration of 20 to 1000 microseconds preferably 200 microseconds. A burst followed by a silent inter burst interval repeats at 1 to 5000 bursts per second bps preferably at 15 50 bps. The preferred shape of each pulse is a full sinusoidal wave. The preferred stimulator shapes an elongated electric field of effect that can be oriented parallel to a long nerve such as a vagus nerve in the patient s neck. By selecting a suitable waveform to stimulate the nerve along with suitable parameters such as current voltage pulse width pulses per burst inter burst interval etc. the stimulator produces a correspondingly selective physiological response in an individual patient. Such a suitable waveform and parameters are simultaneously selected to avoid substantially stimulating nerves and tissue other than the target nerve particularly avoiding the stimulation of nerves that produce pain.

Teachings of the present invention demonstrate how the disclosed non invasive stimulators may be positioned and used against body surfaces particularly at a location on the patient s neck under which a vagus nerve is situated. Those teachings also describe the production of certain beneficial therapeutic effects in a patient. However it should be understood that application of the methods and devices is not limited to the examples that are given.

The novel systems devices and methods for treating conditions using the disclosed stimulator or other non invasive stimulation devices are more completely described in the following detailed description of the invention with reference to the drawings provided herewith and in claims appended hereto. Other aspects features advantages etc. will become apparent to one skilled in the art when the description of the invention herein is taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Hereby all issued patents published patent applications and non patent publications that are mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes to the same extent as if each individual issued patent published patent application or non patent publication were specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.

In the present invention energy is transmitted non invasively to a patient. The invention is particularly useful for producing applied electrical impulses that interact with the signals of one or more nerves to achieve a therapeutic result. In particular the present disclosure describes devices and methods to stimulate a vagus nerve non invasively at a location on the patient s neck.

There is a long felt but unsolved need to stimulate the vagus nerve electrically in the neck totally non invasively selectively and essentially without producing pain. As described below this is evidenced by the failure of others to solve the problem that is solved by the present invention such that investigators abandoned the attempt to non invasively stimulate electrically in the neck in favor of stimulating the vagus nerve at other anatomical locations or in favor of stimulating the vagus nerve non electrically. Japanese patent application JP2009233024A with a filing date of Mar. 26 2008 entitled Vagus Nerve Stimulation System to Fukui YOSHIHITO is concerned with stimulation of the vagus nerve on the surface of the neck to control heart rate rather than epilepsy depression or other infirmities that vagal nerve stimulation VNS is ordinarily intended to treat. Nevertheless the approach that is taken by Yoshihito illustrates the difficulties encountered with non invasive electrical stimulation the vagus nerve. Yoshihito notes that because electrical stimulation on the surface of the neck may co stimulate the phrenic nerve that is involved with the control of respiration the patient hiccups and does not breathe normally resulting in a patient sense of incongruity and displeasure. Yoshihito s proposed solution to the problem is to modulate the timing and intensity of the electrical stimulation at the neck as a function of the respiratory phase in such a way that the undesirable respiratory effects are minimized. Thus Yoshihito s approach is to compensate for non selective nerve stimulation rather than find a way to stimulate the vagus nerve selectively. However such compensatory modulation might also prevent the stimulation from achieving a beneficial effect in treating epilepsy depression and other infirmities that are ordinarily treated with VNS. Furthermore Yoshihito does not address the problem of pain in the vicinity of the stimulation electrodes. Similar issues could conceivably arise in connection with possible co stimulation of the carotid sinus nerve Ingrid J. M. Scheffers Abraham A. Kroon Peter W. de Leeuw. Carotid Baroreflex Activation Past Present and Future. Curr Hypertens Rep 12 2010 61 66 . Side effects due to co activation of muscle that is controlled by the vagus nerve itself may also occur which exemplify another type of non selective stimulation M Tosato K Yoshida E Toft and J J Struijk. Quasi trapezoidal pulses to selectively block the activation of intrinsic laryngeal muscles during vagal nerve stimulation. J. Neural Eng. 4 2007 205 212 .

One circumvention of the problem that the present invention solves is to non invasively stimulate the vagus nerve at an anatomical location other than the neck where the nerve lies closer to the skin. A preferred alternate location is in or around the ear tragus meatus and or concha although other locations have been proposed Manuel L. KARELL. TENS in the Treatment of Heroin Dependency.

No. 12 859 568 entitled Non invasive Treatment of Bronchial Constriction to SIMON . However it is not certain that stimulation in this minor branch of the vagus nerve will have the same effect as stimulation of a main vagus nerve in the neck where VNS electrodes are ordinarily implanted and for which VNS therapeutic procedures produce well documented results.

Another circumvention of the problem is to substitute electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve in the neck with some other form of stimulation. For example mechanical stimulation of the vagus nerve on the neck has been proposed as an alternative to electrical stimulation Jared M.

No. 12 859 568 entitled Non invasive Treatment of Bronchial Constriction to SIMON . However such mechanical VNS has only been performed in animal models and there is no evidence that such mechanical VNS would be functionally equivalent to electrical VNS.

Another circumvention of the problem is to use magnetic rather than purely electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve in the neck Q. AZIZ et al.

However magnetic stimulation has the disadvantage that it ordinarily requires complex and expensive equipment and the duration of stimulation may be limited by overheating of the magnetic stimulator.

Transcutaneous electrical stimulation as well as magnetic stimulation can be unpleasant or painful in the experience of patients that undergo such procedures. The quality of sensation caused by stimulation depends strongly on current and frequency such that currents barely greater than the perception threshold generally cause painless sensations described as tingle itch vibration buzz touch pressure or pinch but higher currents can cause sharp or burning pain. As the depth of penetration of the stimulus under the skin is increased e.g. to deeper nerves such as the vagus nerve any pain will generally begin or increase. Strategies to reduce the pain include use of anesthetics placed on or injected into the skin near the stimulation and placement of foam pads on the skin at the site of stimulation Jeffrey J.

Additional considerations related to pain resulting from the stimulation are as follows. When stimulation is repeated over the course of multiple sessions patients may adapt to the pain and exhibit progressively less discomfort. Patients may be heterogeneous with respect to their threshold for pain caused by stimulation including heterogeneity related to gender and age. Electrical properties of an individual s skin vary from day to day and may be affected by cleaning abrasion and the application of various electrode gels and pastes. Skin properties may also be affected by the stimulation itself as a function of the duration of stimulation the recovery time between stimulation sessions the transdermal voltage the current density and the power density. The application of multiple electrical pulses can result in different perception or pain thresholds and levels of sensation depending on the spacing and rate at which pulses are applied. The separation distance between two electrodes determines whether sensations from the electrodes are separate overlap or merge. The limit for tolerable sensation is sometimes said to correspond to a current density of 0.5 mA cm but in reality the functional relationship between pain and current density is very complicated. Maximum local current density may be more important in producing pain than average current density and local current density generally varies under an electrode e.g. with greater current densities along edges of the electrode or at hot spots. Furthermore pain thresholds can have a thermal and or electrochemical component as well as a current density component. Pulse frequency plays a significant role in the perception of pain with muscle contraction being involved at some frequencies and not others and with the spatial extent of the pain sensation also being a function of frequency. The sensation is also a function of the waveform square wave sinusoidal trapezoidal etc. especially if pulses are less than a millisecond in duration Mark R. PRAUSNITZ.

Considering that there are so many variables that may influence the likelihood of pain during non invasive electrical stimulation detailed stimulus waveform frequency current density electrode type and geometry skin preparation etc. considering that these same variables must be simultaneously selected in order to independently produce a desired therapeutic outcome by vagal nerve stimulation and considering that one also wishes to selectively stimulate the vagus nerve e.g avoid stimulating the phrenic nerve it is understandable that prior to the present disclosure no one has described devices and methods for stimulating the vagus nerve electrically in the neck totally non invasively selectively and without causing substantial pain.

Applicant discovered the disclosed devices and methods in the course of experimentation with a magnetic stimulation device that was disclosed in Applicant s commonly assigned co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 964 050 entitled Magnetic Stimulation Devices and Methods of Therapy to SIMON et al. Thus combined elements in the invention do not merely perform the function that the elements perform separately viz. perform therapeutic VNS minimize stimulation pain or stimulate the vagus nerve selectively and one of ordinary skill in the art would not have combined the claimed elements by known methods because the archetypal magnetic stimulator was known only to Applicant. That stimulator used a magnetic coil embedded in a safe and practical conducting medium that was in direct contact with arbitrarily oriented patient skin which had not been described in its closest art Rafael CARBUNARU and Dominique M. Durand. Toroidal coil models for transcutaneous magnetic stimulation of nerves. IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering 48 4 2001 434 441 Rafael Carbunaru FAIERSTEIN Coil Designs for Localized and Efficient Magnetic Stimulation of the Nervous System. Ph.D. Dissertation Department of Biomedical Engineering Case Western Reserve May 1999. UMI Microform Number 9940153 UMI Company Ann Arbor Mich. . Such a design which is adapted herein for use with surface electrodes makes it possible to shape the electric field that is used to selectively stimulate a deep nerve such as a vagus nerve in the neck. Furthermore the design produces significantly less pain or discomfort if any to a patient than stimulator devices that are currently known in the art. Conversely for a given amount of pain or discomfort on the part of the patient e.g. the threshold at which such discomfort or pain begins the design achieves a greater depth of penetration of the stimulus under the skin.

Although a pair of electrodes is shown in in practice the electrodes may also comprise three or more distinct electrode elements each of which is connected in series or in parallel to the impulse generator . Thus the electrodes that are shown in represent all electrodes of the device collectively.

The item labeled in as is a volume contiguous with an electrode that is filled with electrically conducting medium. As described below in connection with embodiments of the invention conducting medium in which the electrode is embedded need not completely surround an electrode. As also described below in connection with a preferred embodiment the volume is electrically connected to the patient at a target skin surface in order to shape the current density passed through an electrode that is needed to accomplish stimulation of the patient s nerve or tissue. The electrical connection to the patient s skin surface is through an interface . In a preferred embodiment the interface is made of an electrically insulating dielectric material such as a thin sheet of Mylar. In that case electrical coupling of the stimulator to the patient is capacitive. In other embodiments the interface comprises electrically conducting material such as the electrically conducting medium itself or an electrically conducting or permeable membrane. In that case electrical coupling of the stimulator to the patient is ohmic. As shown the interface may be deformable such that it is form fitting when applied to the surface of the body. Thus the sinuousness or curvature shown at the outer surface of the interface corresponds also to sinuousness or curvature on the surface of the body against which the interface is applied so as to make the interface and body surface contiguous.

The control unit controls the impulse generator to generate a signal for each of the device s electrodes. The signals are selected to be suitable for amelioration of a particular medical condition when the signals are applied non invasively to a target nerve or tissue via the electrodes . It is noted that nerve stimulating modulating device may be referred to by its function as a pulse generator. Patent application publications US2005 0075701 and US2005 0075702 both to SHAFER both of which are incorporated herein by reference relating to stimulation of neurons of the sympathetic nervous system to attenuate an immune response contain descriptions of pulse generators that may be applicable to the present invention. By way of example a pulse generator is also commercially available such as Agilent 33522A Function Arbitrary Waveform Generator Agilent Technologies Inc. 5301 Stevens Creek Blvd Santa Clara Calif. 95051.

The control unit may also comprise a general purpose computer comprising one or more CPU computer memories for the storage of executable computer programs including the system s operating system and the storage and retrieval of data disk storage devices communication devices such as serial and USB ports for accepting external signals from the system s keyboard and computer mouse as well as any externally supplied physiological signals analog to digital converters for digitizing externally supplied analog signals communication devices for the transmission and receipt of data to and from external devices such as printers and modems that comprise part of the system hardware for generating the display of information on monitors that comprise part of the system and busses to interconnect the above mentioned components. Thus the user may operate the system by typing instructions for the control unit at a device such as a keyboard and view the results on a device such as the system s computer monitor or direct the results to a printer modem and or storage disk. Control of the system may be based upon feedback measured from externally supplied physiological or environmental signals. Alternatively the control unit may have a compact and simple structure for example wherein the user may operate the system using only an on off switch and power control wheel or knob.

Parameters for the nerve or tissue stimulation include power level frequency and train duration or pulse number . The stimulation characteristics of each pulse such as depth of penetration strength and selectivity depend on the rise time and peak electrical energy transferred to the electrodes as well as the spatial distribution of the electric field that is produced by the electrodes. The rise time and peak energy are governed by the electrical characteristics of the stimulator and electrodes as well as by the anatomy of the region of current flow within the patient. In one embodiment of the invention pulse parameters are set in such as way as to account for the detailed anatomy surrounding the nerve that is being stimulated Bartosz SAWICKI Robert Szmuro Przemysaw Ponecki Jacek Starzy ski Stanisaw Wincenciak Andrzej Rysz. Mathematical Modelling of Vagus Nerve Stimulation. pp. 92 97 in Krawczyk A. Electromagnetic Field Health and Environment Proceedings of EHE 07. Amsterdam IOS Press 2008 . Pulses may be monophasic biphasic or polyphasic. Embodiments of the invention include those that are fixed frequency where each pulse in a train has the same inter stimulus interval and those that have modulated frequency where the intervals between each pulse in a train can be varied.

In addition or as an alternative to the devices to implement the modulation unit for producing the electrical voltage current profile of the stimulating blocking and or modulating impulse to the electrodes the device disclosed in patent publication No. US2005 0216062 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference may be employed. That patent publication discloses a multifunctional electrical stimulation ES system adapted to yield output signals for effecting electromagnetic or other forms of electrical stimulation for a broad spectrum of different biological and biomedical applications which produce an electric field pulse in order to non invasively stimulate nerves. The system includes an ES signal stage having a selector coupled to a plurality of different signal generators each producing a signal having a distinct shape such as a sine wave a square or a saw tooth wave or simple or complex pulse the parameters of which are adjustable in regard to amplitude duration repetition rate and other variables. Examples of the signals that may be generated by such a system are described in a publication by LIBOFF A. R. LIBOFF. Signal shapes in electromagnetic therapies a primer. pp. 17 37 in Bioelectromagnetic Medicine Paul J. Rosch and Marko S. Markov eds. . New York Marcel Dekker 2004 . The signal from the selected generator in the ES stage is fed to at least one output stage where it is processed to produce a high or low voltage or current output of a desired polarity whereby the output stage is capable of yielding an electrical stimulation signal appropriate for its intended application. Also included in the system is a measuring stage which measures and displays the electrical stimulation signal operating on the substance being treated as well as the outputs of various sensors which sense conditions prevailing in this substance whereby the user of the system can manually adjust it or have it automatically adjusted by feedback to provide an electrical stimulation signal of whatever type the user wishes who can then observe the effect of this signal on a substance being treated.

The stimulating blocking and or modulating impulse signal preferably has a frequency an amplitude a duty cycle a pulse width a pulse shape etc. selected to influence the therapeutic result namely stimulating blocking and or modulating some or all of the transmission of the selected nerve. For example the frequency may be about 1 Hz or greater such as between about 15 Hz to 50 Hz more preferably around 25 Hz. The modulation signal may have a pulse width selected to influence the therapeutic result such as about 20 microseconds or greater such as about 20 microseconds to about 1000 microseconds. For example the electric field induced by the device within tissue in the vicinity of a nerve is 10 to 600 V m preferably around 300 V m. The gradient of the electric field may be greater than 2 V m mm. More generally the stimulation device produces an electric field in the vicinity of the nerve that is sufficient to cause the nerve to depolarize and reach a threshold for action potential propagation which is approximately 8 V m at 1000 Hz.

An objective of the disclosed stimulator is to provide both nerve fiber selectivity and spatial selectivity. Spatial selectivity may be achieved in part through the design of the electrode configuration and nerve fiber selectivity may be achieved in part through the design of the stimulus waveform but designs for the two types of selectivity are intertwined. This is because for example a waveform may selectively stimulate only one of two nerves whether they lie close to one another or not obviating the need to focus the stimulating signal onto only one of the nerves GRILL W and Mortimer J T. Stimulus waveforms for selective neural stimulation. IEEE Eng. Med. Biol. 14 1995 375 385 . These methods complement or overlap others that are used to achieve selective nerve stimulation such as the use of local anesthetic application of pressure inducement of ischemia cooling use of ultrasound graded increases in stimulus intensity exploiting the absolute refractory period of axons and the application of stimulus blocks John E. SWETT and Charles M. Bourassa. Electrical stimulation of peripheral nerve. In Electrical Stimulation Research Techniques Michael M. Patterson and Raymond P. Kesner eds. Academic Press. New York 1981 pp. 243 295 .

To date the selection of stimulation waveform parameters for vagal nerve stimulation VNS has been highly empirical in which the parameters are varied about some initially successful set of parameters in an effort to find an improved set of parameters for each patient. A more efficient approach to selecting stimulation parameters might be to select a stimulation waveform that mimics electrical activity in the regions of the brain that one is attempting stimulate indirectly in an effort to entrain the naturally occurring electrical waveform as suggested in U.S. Pat. No. 6 234 953 entitled Electrotherapy device using low frequency magnetic pulses to THOMAS et al. and application number US20090299435 entitled Systems and methods for enhancing or affecting neural stimulation efficiency and or efficacy to GLINER et al. One may also vary stimulation parameters iteratively in search of an optimal setting U.S. Pat. No. 7 869 885 entitled Threshold optimization for tissue stimulation therapy to Begnaud et al . However some VNS stimulation waveforms such as those described herein are discovered by trial and error and then deliberately improved upon.

Invasive vagal nerve stimulation typically uses square wave pulse signals. The typical waveform parameter values for VNS therapy for epilepsy and depression are a current between 1 and 2 mA a frequency of between 20 and 30 Hz a pulse width of 250 500 microseconds and a duty cycle of 10 signal ON time of 30 s and a signal OFF time to 5 min . Output current is gradually increased from 0.25 mA to the maximum tolerable level maximum 3.5 mA with typical therapeutic settings ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 mA. Greater output current is associated with increased side effects including voice alteration cough a feeling of throat tightening and dyspnea. Frequency is typically 20 Hz in depression and 30 Hz in epilepsy. The therapy is adjusted in a gradual systematic fashion to individualize therapy for each patient. To treat migraine headaches typical VNS parameters are a current of 0.25 to 1 mA a frequency of 30 Hz a pulse width of 500 microseconds and an ON time of 30 s every 5 min. To treat migrane plus epilepsy typical parameters are 1.75 mA a frequency of 20 Hz a pulse width of 250 microseconds and ON time of 7 s followed by an OFF time of 12 s. To treat mild to moderate Alzheimer s disease typical VNS waveform parameters are a current of 0.25 to 0.5 mA a frequency of 20 Hz a pulse width of 500 microseconds and an ON time of 30 s every 5 min.

Applicant also found that stimulation waveforms consisting of bursts of square pulses are not ideal for non invasive VNS stimulation M. I. JOHNSON C. H. Ashton D. R. Bousfield and J. W. Thompson. Analgesic effects of different pulse patterns of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on cold induced pain in normal subjects. Journal of Psychosomatic Research 35 2 3 1991 313 321 U.S. Pat. No. 7 734 340 entitled Stimulation design for neuromodulation to De Ridder . However bursts of sinusoidal pulses are a preferred stimulation waveform as shown in . As seen there individual sinusoidal pulses have a period of and a burst consists of N such pulses. This is followed by a period with no signal the inter burst period . The pattern of a burst plus followed by silent inter burst period repeats itself with a period of T. For example the sinusoidal period may be 200 microseconds the number of pulses per burst may be N 5 and the whole pattern of burst followed by silent inter burst period may have a period of T 40000 microseconds a much smaller value of T is shown in to make the bursts discernable . When these exemplary values are used for T and the waveform contains significant Fourier components at higher frequencies 1 200 microseconds 5000 sec as compared with those contained in transcutaneous nerve stimulation waveforms as currently practiced. Applicant is unaware of such a waveform having been used with vagus nerve stimulation but a similar waveform has been used to stimulate muscle as a means of increasing muscle strength in elite athletes. However for the muscle strengthening application the currents used 200 mA may be very painful and two orders of magnitude larger than what is disclosed herein for VNS. Furthermore the signal used for muscle strengthening may be other than sinusoidal e.g. triangular and the parameters N and T may also be dissimilar from the values exemplified above A. DELITTO M.

By way of example the electric field shown in may have an Evalue of 17 V m which is sufficient to stimulate the vagus nerve but is significantly lower than the threshold needed to stimulate surrounding muscle.

In order to compare the stimulator that is disclosed herein with existing electrodes and stimulators used for non invasive electrical stimulation it is useful to first summarize the relevant physics of electric fields and currents that are produced by the electrodes. According to Maxwell s equation Ampere s law with Maxwell correction B J E t where B is the magnetic field J is the electrical current density E is the electric field is the permittivity and t is time Richard P. FEYNMAN Robert B. Leighton and Matthew Sands. The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Volume II. Addison Wesley Publ. Co. Reading Mass. 1964 page 15 15 .

According to Faraday s law E B t. However for present purposes changes in the magnetic field B may be ignored so E 0 and E may therefore be obtained from the gradient of a scalar potential E . In general the scalar potential and the electric field E are functions of position r and time t .

The electrical current density J is also a function of position r and time t and it is determined by the electric field and conductivity as follows where the conductivity is generally a tensor and a function of position r J E .

If the current flows in material that is essentially unpolarizable i.e. is presumed not to be a dielectric so that 0 substitution of the expression for J into the above expression for Ampere s law gives 0 which is a form of Laplace s equation. If the conductivity of material in the device or patient is itself a function of the electric field or potential then the equation becomes non linear which could exhibit multiple solutions frequency multiplication and other such non linear behavior. The equation has been solved analytically for special electrode configurations but for more general electrode configurations it must be solved numerically Petrus J. CILLIERS.

If capacitive effects cannot be ignored an additional term involving the time derivative of the gradient of the potential appears in the more general expression as obtained by substituting the expressions for J and E into the divergence of Ampere s law with Maxwell s correction 0

The permittivity is a function of position r and is generally a tensor. It may result from properties of the body and may also be a property of the electrode design L. A. GEDDES M. Hinds and K. S. Foster. Stimulation with capacitor electrodes. Med. and Biol. Eng. and Comput. 25 1987 359 360 . As a consequence of such a term the waveform of the electrical potential at points within the body will generally be altered relative to the waveform of the voltage signal s applied to the electrode s . Furthermore if the permittivity of a material in the device itself or patient is a function of the electric field or potential then the equation becomes non linear which could exhibit multiple solutions frequency multiplication and other such non linear behavior. This time dependent equation has been solved numerically KUHN A Keller T. A 3D transient model for transcutaneous functional electrical stimulation.

In any case Dirichlet D boundary conditions define voltage sources and Neumann N boundary conditions describe the behavior of the electric field at the crossover boundary from skin to air as follows and 

where n denotes the outward pointing normal vector i.e. the vector orthogonal to the boundary curve and V t denotes the voltage applied to an electrode. Thus no conduction current can flow across an air conductor interface so according to the interfacial boundary conditions the component of any current normal to the an air conductor interface must be zero. In constructing the above differential equation for as a function of time the divergence of J is taken which satisfies the continuity equation J t where is the charge density. Conservation of charge requires that sides of this equation equal zero everywhere except at the surface of the electrode where charge is impressed upon the system injected or received .

It is an objective of the present invention to shape an elongated electric field of effect that can be oriented parallel to a long nerve such as the vagus nerve in the neck. The term shape an electric field as used herein means to create an electric field or its gradient that is generally not radially symmetric at a given depth of stimulation in the patient especially a field that is characterized as being elongated or finger like and especially also a field in which the magnitude of the field in some direction may exhibit more than one spatial maximum i.e. may be bimodal or multimodal such that the tissue between the maxima may contain an area across which current flow is restricted. Shaping of the electric field refers both to the circumscribing of regions within which there is a significant electric field and to configuring the directions of the electric field within those regions. Our invention does so by configuring elements that are present within the equations that were summarized above comprising but not limited to the following exemplary configurations that may be used alone or in combination.

First different contours or shapes of the electrodes affect J. For example charge is impressed upon the system injected or received differently if an electode is curved versus flat or if there are more than two electrodes in the system.

Second values of the voltage V t in the above boundary condition is manipulated to shape the electric field. For example if the device contains two pairs of electrodes that are perpendicular or at a variable angle with respect to one another the waveform of the voltage across one pair of electrodes may be different than the waveform of the voltage across the second pair so that the superimposed electric fields that they produce may exhibit beat frequencies as has been attempted with electrode based stimulators U.S. Pat. No. 5 512 057 entitled Interferential stimulator for applying localized stimulation to REISS et al. and acoustic stimulators U.S. Pat. No. 5 903 516 entitled Acoustic force generator for detection imaging and information transmission using the beat signal of multiple intersecting sonic beams to GREENLEAF et al .

Third the scalar potential in the above equation n r may be manipulated to shape the electric field. For example this is accomplished by changing the boundaries of conductor air or non conductor interfaces thereby creating different boundary conditions. For example the conducting material may pass through conducting apertures in an insulated mesh before contacting the patient s skin creating thereby an array of electric field maxima. As another example an electrode may be disposed at the end of a long tube that is filled with conducting material or the electrode may be situated at the bottom of a curved cup that is filled with conducting material. In those cases the dimensions of the tube or cup would affect the resulting electric fields and currents.

Fourth the conductivity in the equation J E may be varied spatially within the device by using two or more different conducting materials that are in contact with one another for given boundary conditions. The conductivity may also be varied by constructing some conducting material from a semiconductor which allows for adjustment of the conductivity in space and in time by exposure of the semiconductor to agents to which they are sensitive such as electric fields light at particular wavelengths temperature or some other environmental variable over which the user of the device has control. For the special case in which the semiconductor s conductivity may be made to approach zero that would approximate the imposition of an interfacial boundary condition as described in the previous paragraph.

Fifth a dielectric material having a high permittivity such as Mylar neoprene titanium dioxide or strontium titanate may be used in the device for example in order to permit capacitative electrical coupling to the patient s skin. Changing the permittivity in conjunction along with changing the waveform V t would especially affect operation of the device because the permittivity appears in a term that is a function of the time derivative of the electric potential .

In configurations of the present invention an electrode is situated in a container that is filled with conducting material. In one embodiment the container contains holes so that the conducting material e.g. a conducting gel can make physical contact with the patient s skin through the holes. For example the conducting medium in may comprise a chamber surrounding the electrode filled with a conductive gel that has the approximate viscosity and mechanical consistency of gel deodorant e.g. Right Guard Clear Gel from Dial Corporation 15501 N.

The gel which is less viscous than conventional electrode gel is maintained in the chamber with a mesh of openings at the end where the device is to contact the patient s skin. The gel does not leak out and it can be dispensed with a simple screw driven piston.

In another embodiment the container itself is made of a conducting elastomer e.g. dry carbon filled silicone elastomer and electrical contact with the patient is through the elastomer itself possibly through an additional outside coating of conducting material. In some embodiments of the invention the conducting medium may be a balloon filled with a conducting gel or conducting powders or the balloon may be constructed extensively from deformable conducting elastomers. The balloon conforms to the skin surface removing any air thus allowing for high impedance matching and conduction of large electric fields in to the tissue.

Agar can also be used as part of the conducting medium but it is not preferred because agar degrades in time is not ideal to use against skin and presents difficulties with cleaning the patient. Rather than using agar as the conducting medium an electrode can instead be in contact with in a conducting solution such as 1 10 NaCl that also contacts an electrically conducting interface to the human tissue. Such an interface is useful as it allows current to flow from the electrode into the tissue and supports the conducting medium wherein the device can be completely sealed. Thus the interface is material interposed between the conducting medium and patient s skin that allows the conducting medium e.g. saline solution to slowly leak through it allowing current to flow to the skin. Several interfaces in are disclosed as follows.

One interface comprises conducting material that is hydrophilic such as Tecophlic from The Lubrizol Corporation 29400 Lakeland Boulevard Wickliffe Ohio 44092. It absorbs from 10 100 of its weight in water making it highly electrically conductive while allowing only minimal bulk fluid flow.

Another material that may be used as an interface is a hydrogel such as that used on standard EEG EKG and TENS electrodes Rylie A GREEN Sungchul Baek Laura A Poole Warren and Penny J Martens. Conducting polymer hydrogels for medical electrode applications. Sci. Technol. Adv. Mater. 11 2010 014107 13 pp . For example it may be the following hypoallergenic bacteriostatic electrode gel SIGNAGEL Electrode Gel from Parker Laboratories Inc. 286 Eldridge Rd. Fairfield N.J. 07004. Another example is the KM10T hydrogel from Katecho Inc. 4020 Gannett Ave. Des Moines Iowa 50321.

A third type of interface may be made from a very thin material with a high dielectric constant such as those used to make capacitors. For example Mylar can be made in submicron thicknesses and has a dielectric constant of about 3. Thus at stimulation frequencies of several kilohertz or greater the Mylar will capacitively couple the signal through it because it will have an impedance comparable to that of the skin itself. Thus it will isolate the electrode and conducting solution in from the tissue yet allow current to pass.

The stimulator in shows two equivalent electrodes side by side wherein electrical current would pass through the two electrodes in opposite directions. Thus the current will flow from one electrode through the tissue and back through the other electrode completing the circuit within the electrodes conducting media that are separated from one another. An advantage of using two equivalent electrodes in this configuration is that this design will increase the magnitude of the electric field gradient between them which is crucial for exciting long straight axons such as the vagus nerve in the neck and other deep peripheral nerves.

A preferred embodiment of the stimulator is shown in . A cross sectional view of the stimulator along its long axis is shown in . As shown the stimulator comprises two heads and a body that joins them. Each head contains a stimulating electrode. The body of the stimulator contains the electronic components and battery not shown that are used to generate the signals that drive the electrodes which are located behind the insulating board that is shown in . However in other embodiments of the invention the electronic components that generate the signals that are applied to the electrodes may be separate but connected to the electrode head using wires. Furthermore other embodiments of the invention may contain a single such head or more than two heads.

Heads of the stimulator are applied to a surface of the patient s body during which time the stimulator may be held in place by straps or frames not shown or the stimulator may be held against the patient s body by hand. In either case the level of stimulation power may be adjusted with a wheel that also serves as an on off switch. A light is illuminated when power is being supplied to the stimulator. A cap is provided to cover each of the stimulator heads to protect the device when not in use to avoid accidental stimulation and to prevent material within the head from leaking or drying. Thus in this embodiment of the invention mechanical and electronic components of the stimulator impulse generator control unit and power source are compact portable and simple to operate.

Construction of the stimulator head is shown in more detail in . In the embodiment shown in the stimulator head contains an aperture screen but in the embodiment shown in there is no aperture screen. Referring now to the exploded view shown in the electrode head is assembled from a snap on cap that serves as a tambour for a dielectric or conducting membrane an aperture screen the head cup the electrode which is also a screw and a lead mounting screw that is inserted into the electrode . The electrode seen in each stimulator head has the shape of a screw that is flattened on its tip. Pointing of the tip would make the electrode more of a point source such that the above mentioned equations for the electrical potential may have a solution corresponding more closely to a far field approximation. Rounding of the electrode surface or making the surface with another shape will likewise affect the boundary conditions. Completed assembly of the stimulator head is shown in which also shows how the head is attached to the body of the stimulator .

The membrane serves as the interface shown as in . For example the membrane may be made of a dielectric non conducting material such as a thin sheet of Mylar. In other embodiments it may be made of conducting material such as a sheet of Tecophlic material from Lubrizol Corporation 29400 Lakeland Boulevard Wickliffe Ohio 44092. The apertures may be open or they may be plugged with conducting material for example KM10T hydrogel from Katecho Inc. 4020 Gannett Ave. Des Moines Iowa 50321. If the apertures are so plugged and the membrane is made of conducting material the membrane becomes optional and the plug serves as the interface shown in . The head cup is filled with conducting material for example SIGNAGEL Electrode Gel from Parker Laboratories Inc. 286 Eldridge Rd. Fairfield N.J. 07004. The snap on cap aperture screen head cup and body of the stimulator are made of a non conducting material such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. The depth of the head cup from its top surface to the electrode may be between one and six centimeters. The head cup may have a different curvature than what is shown in or it may be tubular or conical or have some other inner surface geomety that will affect the Neumann boundary conditions.

The alternate embodiment of the stimulator head that is shown in also contains a snap on cap membrane that is made of a dielectric or a conducting material the head cup the electrode which is also a screw and a lead mounting screw that is inserted into the electrode . This alternate embodiment differs from the embodiment shown in in regard to the mechanical support that is provided to the membrane . Whereas the aperture screen had provided mechanical support to the membrane in the other embodiment in the alternate embodiment a reinforcing ring is provided to the membrane. That reinforcement ring rests on non conducting struts that are placed in the head cup and a non conducting strut ring is placed within notches in the struts to hold the struts in place. An advantage of the alternate embodiment is that without apertures current flow may be less restricted through the membrane especially if the membrane is made of a conducting material. Furthermore although the struts and strut ring are made of non conducting material in this alternate embodiment the design may be adapted to position additional electrode or other conducting elements within the head cup for other more specialized configurations of the stimulator head the inclusion of which will influence the electric fields that are generated by the device. Completed assembly of the alternate stimulator head is shown in without showing attachment to the body of the stimulator and without showing the insertion of the lead mounting screw . In fact it is also possible to insert a lead under the head of the electrode and many other methods of attaching the electrode to the signal generating electronics of the stimulator are known in the art.

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the interface in or in is made from a very thin material with a high dielectric constant such as material used to make capacitors. For example it may be Mylar having a submicron thickness preferably in the range 0.5 to 1.5 microns having a dielectric constant of about 3. Thus at stimulation Fourier frequencies of several kilohertz or greater the dielectric interface will capacitively couple the signal through itself because it will have an impedance comparable to that of the skin. Thus the dielectric interface will isolate the stimulator s electrode from the tissue yet allow current to pass. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention non invasive electrical stimulation of a nerve is accomplished essentially substantially capacitively which reduces the amount of ohmic stimulation thereby reducing the sensation the patient feels on the tissue surface. This would correspond to a situation for example in which at least 30 preferably at least 50 of the energy stimulating the nerve comes from capacitive coupling through the stimulator interface rather than from ohmic coupling. In other words a substantial portion e.g. 50 of the voltage drop is across the dielectric interface while the remaining portion is through the tissue.

In certain exemplary embodiments the dielectric interface comprises a material that will also provide a substantial or complete seal of the interior of the device. This inhibits any leakage of conducting material such as gel from the interior of the device and also inhibits any fluids from entering the device. In addition this feature allows the user to easily clean the surface of the dielectric material e.g. with alcohol or similar disinfectant avoiding potential contamination during subsequent uses of the device. One such material is a thin sheet of Mylar as described above.

The selection of the material for the dielectric constant involves at least two important variables 1 the thickness of the interface and 2 the dielectric constant of the material. The thinner the interface and or the higher the dielectric constant of the material the lower the voltage drop across the dielectric interface and thus the lower the driving voltage required . For example with Mylar the thickness could be about 0.5 to 5 microns preferably about 1 micron with a dielectric constant of about 3. For a piezoelectric material like barium titanate or PZT lead zirconate titanate the thickness could be about 100 400 microns preferably about 200 microns or 0.2 mm because the dielectric constant is 1000.

In another embodiment the interface comprises a fluid permeable material that allows for passage of current through the permeable portions of the material. In this embodiment a conductive medium such as a gel is preferably situated between the electrode s and the permeable interface. The conductive medium provides a conductive pathway for electrons to pass through the permeable interface to the outer surface of the interface and to the patient s skin.

One of the novelties of the disclosed stimulating non invasive capacitive stimulator hereinafter referred to more generally as a capacitive electrode arises in that it uses a low voltage generally less than 100 volt power source which is made possible by the use of a suitable stimulation waveform such as the waveform that is disclosed herein . In addition the capacitive electrode allows for the use of an interface that provides a more adequate seal of the interior of the device. The capacitive electrode may be used by applying a small amount of conductive material e.g. conductive gel as described above to its outer surface. In some embodiments it may also be used by contacting dry skin thereby avoiding the inconvenience of applying an electrode gel paste or other electrolytic material to the patient s skin and avoiding the problems associated with the drying of electrode pastes and gels. Such a dry electrode would be particularly suitable for use with a patient who exhibits dermatitis after the electrode gel is placed in contact with the skin Ralph J. COSKEY. Contact dermatitis caused by ECG electrode jelly. Arch Dermatol 113 1977 839 840 . The capacitive electrode may also be used to contact skin that has been wetted e.g. with tap water or a more conventional electrolyte material to make the electrode skin contact here the dielectric constant more uniform A L ALEXELONESCU G Barbero F C M Freire and R Merletti.

As described below capacitive biomedical electrodes are known in the art but when used to stimulate a nerve noninvasively a high voltage power supply is currently used to perform the stimulation. Otherwise prior use of capacitive biomedical electrodes has been limited to invasive implanted applications to non invasive applications that involve monitoring or recording of a signal but not stimulation of tissue to non invasive applications that involve the stimulation of something other than a nerve e.g. tumor or as the dispersive electrode in electrosurgery.

Evidence of a long felt but unsolved need and evidence of failure of others to solve the problem that is solved by the invention low voltage non invasive capacitive stimulation of a nerve is provided by KELLER and Kuhn who review the previous high voltage capacitive stimulating electrode of GEDDES et al and write that Capacitive stimulation would be a preferred way of activating muscle nerves and fibers when the inherent danger of high voltage breakdowns of the dielectric material can be eliminated. Goal of future research could be the development of improved and ultra thin dielectric foils such that the high stimulation voltage can be lowered. L. A. GEDDES M. Hinds and K. S. Foster. Stimulation with capacitor electrodes. Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing 25 1987 359 360 Thierry KELLER and Andreas Kuhn. Electrodes for transcutaneous surface electrical stimulation. Journal of Automatic Control University of Belgrade 18 2 2008 35 45 on page 39 . It is understood that in the United States according to the 2005 National Electrical Code high voltage is any voltage over 600 V. U.S. Pat. No. 3 077 884 entitled Electro physiotherapy apparatus to BARTROW et al and U.S. Pat. No. 4 144 893 entitled Neuromuscular therapy device to HICKEY also describe high voltage capacitive stimulation electrodes. U.S. Pat. No. 7 904 180 entitled Capacitive medical electrode to JUOLA et al describes a capacitive electrode that includes transcutaneous nerve stimulation as one intended application but that patent does not describe stimulation voltages or stimulation waveforms and frequencies that are to be used for the transcutaneous stimulation.

No. 7 805 201 entitled Treating a tumor or the like with an electric field to PALTI also describe capacitive stimulation electrodes but they are intended for the treatment of tumors do not disclose uses involving nerves and teach stimulation frequencies in the range of 50 kHz to about 500 kHz.

The present invention uses a different method to lower the high stimulation voltage than developing ultra thin dielectric foils namely to use a suitable stimulation waveform such as the waveform that is disclosed herein . That waveform has significant Fourier components at higher frequencies than waveforms used for transcutaneous nerve stimulation as currently practiced. Thus one of ordinary skill in the art would not have combined the claimed elements because transcutaneous nerve stimulation is performed with waveforms having significant Fourier components only at lower frequencies and noninvasive capacitive nerve stimulation is performed at higher voltages. In fact the elements in combination do not merely perform the function that each element performs separately. The dielectric material alone may be placed in contact with the skin in order to perform pasteless or dry stimulation with a more uniform current density than is associated with ohmic stimulation albeit with high stimulation voltages L. A. GEDDES M. Hinds and K. S. Foster. Stimulation with capacitor electrodes. Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing 25 1987 359 360 Yongmin KIM H. Gunter Zieber and Frank A. Yang. Uniformity of current density under stimulating electrodes. Critical Reviews in Biomedical Engineering 17 1990 6 585 619 . With regard to the waveform element a waveform that has significant Fourier components at higher frequencies than waveforms currently used for transcutaneous nerve stimulation may be used to selectively stimulate a deep nerve and avoid stimulating other nerves as disclosed herein for both noncapacitive and capacitive electrodes. But it is the combination of the two elements dielectric interface and waveform that makes it possible to stimulate a nerve capacitively without using the high stimulation voltage as is currently practiced.

The use of high dielectric constant material to cover a metal biomedical electrode was apparently first disclosed by PATZOLD et al in 1940 for diathermy applications U.S. Pat. No. 2 220 269 entitled Electrode means to PATZOLD et al . In the 1960s and early 1970s disclosures of capacitive electrodes were motivated by the fact that other noncapacitive ohmic electrodes used invasively as prosthesis implants exhibit undesirable electrochemical polarization. If the electrode is made of a noble metal then the polarization wastes stimulation energy which is a problem when the electrode is used as a battery powered implant e.g. cardiac pacemeker . If the electrode is made of a non noble metal electrolytic corrosion reactions also occur at the surface of the electrode such that the electrode may be destroyed and potentially toxic substances may be deposited within the patient s body. Furthermore for polarizable electrodes the nature of the electrode electrolyte interaction is such that undesirable electronic nonlinearities arise. Use of a nonpolarizable Ag AgCl electrode to stimulate invasively is not a solution to these problems because of the toxicity of silver Wilson GREATBATCH Bernard Piersma Frederick D. Shannon and Stephen W. Calhoun Jr. Polarization phenomena relating to physiological electrodes. Annals New York Academy of Science 167 1969 2 722 44 .

In view of the above considerations several investigators described capacitive electrodes that would not generate toxic products where their implantation would contact bodily fluids. Such toxic electrolytic products are avoided with capacitive electrodes because the metal of the electrode is surrounded by insulating dielectric material. MAURO described a capacitive electrode wherein an insulated wire is surrounded by a saline solution which is in turn in direct communication with electrolyte that contacts a nerve or tissue. The electrolytic solution s communication was provided by plastic tubing or a single conduit hole for the fluid. In 1971 SCHALDACH described an implanted cardiac pacing electrode wherein a thin dielectric layer of tantalum oxide covers the surface of a metallic electrode tip. In 1973 and 1974 GUYTON and Hambrecht considered using other dielectric materials to coat an implanted stimulating electrode including barium titanate and related ceramic dielectrics organic dielectric materials such as Teflon Parylene and Mylar and Parylene C.

Theory and design of capacitor electrodes for chronic stimulation. Medical and Biological Engineering 12 1974 5 613 620 . However use of such implanted capacitive electrodes has been limited as they may offer little improvement over some non capacitive implanted electrodes in regards to corrosion and the generation of toxic products. This is because for noble metal electrodes particularly those made of platinum and platinum iridium alloys faradaic reactions are confined to a surface monolayer such that these electrodes are often described as pseudocapacitive despite the fact that electron transfer occurs across the noble metal electrode interface Stuart F. Cogan. Neural Stimulation and Recording Electrodes. Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 10 2008 275 309 .

During the early 1970s as implanted capacitive electrodes were being developed for stimulation non invasive capacitive electrodes were simultaneously developed for monitoring or recording purposes with the objective of avoiding the use of electrode paste or jelly. Such pasteless electrodes would be desired for situations involving the long term monitoring or recording of physiological signals from ambulatory patients critical care patients pilots or astronauts. LOPEZ and Richardson 1969 described a capacitive electrode for recording an ECG. POTTER 1970 described a capacitive electrode with a pyre varnish dielectric for recording an EMG. POTTER and Portnoy 1972 described a capacitive electrode with an integrated impendence transformer. MATSUO et al 1973 described a capacitive electrode for measuring an EEG.

It is understood that although non invasive capacitive electrodes can be used as dry pasteless electrodes they may also be used to contact skin that has been wetted e.g. with tap water or a more conventional electrolytic material to make the electrode skin contact here the dielectric constant more uniform. In fact perspiration from the skin will provide some moisture to the boundary between electrode and skin interface.

Disadvantages of the above mentioned non invasive capacitive electrodes include susceptibility to motion artifact a high inherent noise level and susceptibility to change with the presence of perspiration which in practice have tended to outweigh their advantages of being pasteless or dry and exhibition of uniform current density. However in recent years such electrodes have been improved with the objective of being used even without contacting the skin wherein they may record an individual s ECG or EEG when the electrode is placed within clothing head and chest bands chairs beds and the like Yu Mike CHI Tzyy Ping Jung and Gert Cauwenberghs.

For contact capacitive electrodes the issue of perspiration may be addressed by placing indented channels in the skin side surface of the dielectric material parallel to the electrode surface placing absorbent material around the periphery of the electrode then wicking the sweat through the channels into the absorbent material.

Capacitive electrodes have also been used to stimulate tissue other than nerves. They are used as the dispersive electrode in electrosurgery U.S. Pat.

Critical Reviews in Biomedical Engineering 17 1990 6 585 619 . Capacitive electrodes have also been used invasively to treat tumors by implanting a pair of insulated wires in the vicinity of the tumor Eilon D. Kirson Zoya Gurvich Rosa Schneiderman Erez Dekel Aviran Itzhaki Yoram Wasserman Rachel Schatzberger and Yoram Palti. Disruption of cancer cell replication by alternating electric fields. Cancer Research 64 2004 3288 3295 . Similarly they have also been used to treat tumors non invasively U.S. Pat. No. 7 715 921 entitled Electrodes for applying an electric field in vivo over an extended period of time to PALTI U.S. Pat. No. 7 805 201 entitled Treating a tumor or the like with an electric field to PALTI . However none of these applications that involve stimulating tissue other than nerves and none of the other non invasive recording applications and none of the invasive applications disclose methods or devices that would demonstrate how to use capacitive electrodes to stimulate nerves noninvasively using a low voltage stimulator.

Another embodiment of the disclosed stimulator is shown in showing a device in which electrically conducting material is dispensed from the device to the patient s skin. In this embodiment the interface in is the conducting material itself. respectively provide top and bottom views of the outer surface of the electrical stimulator . provides a bottom view of the stimulator after sectioning along its long axis to reveal the inside of the stimulator.

Individual wires not shown connect the impulse generator in to the stimulator s electrodes . The two electrodes are shown here to be elliptical metal discs situated between the head compartment and rear compartment of the stimulator . A partition separates each of the two head compartments from one another and from the single rear compartment . Each partition also holds its corresponding electrode in place. However each electrode may be removed to add electrically conducting gel in to each head compartment . Each partition may also slide towards the head of the device in order to dispense conducting gel through the mesh apertures . The position of each partition therefore determines the distance between its electrode and mesh openings which is variable in order to obtain the optimally uniform current density through the mesh openings . The outside housing of the stimulator as well as each head compartment housing and its partition are made of electrically insulating material such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene so that the two head compartments are electrically insulated from one another.

Although the embodiment in is shown to be a non capacitive stimulator it is understood that it may be converted into a capacitive stimulator by replacing the mesh openings with a dielectric material such as a sheet of Mylar or by covering the mesh openings with a sheet of such dielectric material.

In the preferred embodiments electrodes are made of a metal such as stainless steel platinum or a platinum iridium alloy.

No. 4 215 696 entitled Biomedical electrode with pressurized skin contact to Bremer et al and U.S. Pat. No. 4 166 457 entitled Fluid self sealing bioelectrode to Jacobsen et al. The stimulator designs shown in are also self contained units housing the electrodes signal electronics and power supply. Portable stimulators are also known in the art for example U.S. Pat. No. 7 171 266 entitled Electro acupuncture device with stimulation electrode assembly to Gruzdowich . One of the novelties of the designs shown in is that the stimulator along with a correspondingly suitable stimulation waveform shapes the electric field producing a selective physiological response by stimulating that nerve but avoiding substantial stimulation of nerves and tissue other than the target nerve particularly avoiding the stimulation of nerves that produce pain.

Examples in the remaining disclosure will be directed to methods for using the disclosed electrical stimulation devices for treating a patient. These applications involve stimulating the patient in and around the patient s neck. However it will be appreciated that the systems and methods of the present invention might be applied equally well to other nerves of the body including but not limited to parasympathetic nerves sympathetic nerves and spinal or cranial nerves. As examples the disclosed devices may used to treat particular medical conditions by substituting the devices disclosed herein for the stimulators disclosed in the following patent applications.

Selected nerve fibers are stimulated in different embodiments of methods that make use of the disclosed electrical stimulation devices including stimulation of the vagus nerve at a location in the patient s neck. At that location the vagus nerve is situated within the carotid sheath near the carotid artery and the interior jugular vein. The carotid sheath is located at the lateral boundary of the retopharyngeal space on each side of the neck and deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The left vagus nerve is sometimes selected for stimulation because stimulation of the right vagus nerve may produce undesired effects on the heart but depending on the application the right vagus nerve or both right and left vagus nerves may be stimulated instead.

The three major structures within the carotid sheath are the common carotid artery the internal jugular vein and the vagus nerve. The carotid artery lies medial to the internal jugular vein and the vagus nerve is situated posteriorly between the two vessels. Typically the location of the carotid sheath or interior jugular vein in a patient and therefore the location of the vagus nerve will be ascertained in any manner known in the art e.g. by feel or ultrasound imaging. Proceeding from the skin of the neck above the sternocleidomastoid muscle to the vagus nerve a line may pass successively through the sternocleidomastoid muscle the carotid sheath and the internal jugular vein unless the position on the skin is immediately to either side of the external jugular vein. In the latter case the line may pass successively through only the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the carotid sheath before encountering the vagus nerve missing the interior jugular vein. Accordingly a point on the neck adjacent to the external jugular vein might be preferred for non invasive stimulation of the vagus nerve. The magnetic stimulator coil may be centered on such a point at the level of about the fifth to sixth cervical vertebra.

If it is desired to maintain a constant intensity of stimulation in the vicinity of the vagus nerve or any other nerve or tissue that is being stimulated methods may also be employed to modulate the power of the stimulator in order to compensate for patient motion or other mechanisms that would otherwise give rise to variability in the intensity of stimulation. In the case of stimulation of the vagus nerve such variability may be attributable to the patient s breathing which may involve contraction and associated change in geometry of the sternocleidomastoid muscle that is situated close to the vagus nerve identified as in . Methods for compensating for motion and other confounding factors were disclosed by the present applicant in commonly assigned co pending application U.S. Ser. No. 12 859 568 entitled Non Invasive Treatment of Bronchial Constriction to SIMON which is hereby incorporated by reference.

Methods of treating a patient comprise stimulating the vagus nerve as indicated in using the electrical stimulation devices that are disclosed herein. The position and angular orientation of the device are adjusted about that location until the patient perceives stimulation when current is passed through the stimulator electrodes. The applied current is increased gradually first to a level wherein the patient feels sensation from the stimulation. The power is then increased but is set to a level that is less than one at which the patient first indicates any discomfort. Straps harnesses or frames are used to maintain the stimulator in position not shown in or . The stimulator signal may have a frequency and other parameters that are selected to produce a therapeutic result in the patient. Stimulation parameters for each patient are adjusted on an individualized basis. Ordinarily the amplitude of the stimulation signal is set to the maximum that is comfortable for the patient and then the other stimulation parameters are adjusted.

In other embodiments of the invention pairing of vagus nerve stimulation may be with a time varying sensory stimulation. The paired sensory stimulation may be bright light sound tactile stimulation or electrical stimulation of the tongue to simulate odor taste e.g. pulsating with the same frequency as the vagus nerve electrical stimulation. The rationale for paired sensory stimulation is the same as simultaneous paired stimulation of both left and right vagus nerves namely that the pair of signals interacting with one another in the brain may result in the formation of larger and more coherent neural ensembles than the neural ensembles associated with the individual signals thereby enhancing the therapeutic effect. For example the hypothalamus is well known to be responsive to the presence of bright light so exposing the patient to bright light that is fluctuating with the same stimulation frequency as the vagus nerve or a multiple of that frequency may be performed in an attempt to enhance the role of the hypothalamus in producing the desired therapeutic effect. Such paired stimulation does not rely upon neuronal plasticity and is in that sense different from other reports of paired stimulation Navzer D. ENGINEER Jonathan R. Riley Jonathan D. Seale Will A.
