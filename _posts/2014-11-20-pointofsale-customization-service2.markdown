According to some statistics about sixty percent of all transactions for goods and services are completed using non cash sources of funds. For a majority of retailers who complete these transactions these non cash payments may be accepted using point of sale systems. The point of sale systems may support credit card transactions electronic fund transfer debit card transactions and the like.

During completion of these transactions purchasers may interact with a point of sale system or terminal to complete the transaction. These point of sale systems can provide instructions to a purchaser to guide the purchaser through the payment process and or tailor the customer experience based upon feedback from the purchaser. For example some point of sale devices or terminals may provide language choices an option to withdraw cash from a debit card account used to pay for the goods and services digital signature fields combinations thereof or the like.

Some point of sale devices however may be programmed by a manufacturer or a retailer. As such there is not necessarily consistency among point of sale devices across retailers. In fact some retail locations may have more than one type of point of sale device. Because of the various available point of sale systems and the diversity among programmers who design the customer experience associated with these point of sale devices the purchasing experience at different point of sale devices may be different from a purchasing experience at another type of point of sale device. As such purchasers may make mistakes when completing transactions and or may be unhappy with their experiences during the purchase process.

The point of sale application executed by the computing device can be configured to control operations of the point of sale module to control interactions with a user device such as the user device to control interactions with the point of sale customization service combinations thereof or the like. With regard to controlling communications with devices such as the user device the point of sale application can be configured obtain data from the user device via the point of sale module . According to various embodiments the point of sale application can obtain via the point of sale module one or more of the identifiers described above. The identifiers can be used to identify the user device or other device a user an account or the like.

According to various embodiments the point of sale application also can obtain via the point of sale module other information from the user device such as for example payment information settings and preferences account information or the like as explained above. According to various embodiments of the concepts and technologies described herein however the point of sale application can be configured to obtain via the point of sale module one or more identifiers as illustrated and described herein and to use the identifier to obtain one or more point of sale preferences hereinafter referred to as preferences associated with the user device .

According to various embodiments the user device can be configured to interact with the point of sale customization service to generate the preferences via providing to the point of sale customization service the user data . Thus while illustrates the user data being provided to the point of sale customization service by the computing device it should be understood that this example is illustrative of one contemplated embodiment. According to various other embodiments the user device can provide the user data to the point of sale customization service and the point of sale customization service can be configured to generate based upon the user data the preferences .

As shown in the point of sale customization service can be configured to store the preferences in a data storage device such as a data store . The functionality of the data store can be provided by one or more databases server computers desktop computers mobile telephones laptop computers other computing systems combinations thereof and the like. In the illustrated embodiments the functionality of the data store is illustrated as being provided by a server computer that hosts or stores the preferences . It should be understood that this example is illustrative and therefore should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

As shown in the preferences can include various types of preferences that can be applied to one or more point of sale devices or systems for use before during or after transactions. The preferences can be created updated deleted and or otherwise modified by users or other entities. In some embodiments for example a user or other entity can create or modify the preferences by providing or modifying user data . The user data can be analyzed by the point of sale customization service and the preferences can be created or modified based upon the information included in the user data . The preferences can include but are not limited to data that represents one or more identifiers such as the identifiers data that represents one or more payment methods data that represents one or more language settings data that represents one or more security settings data that represents one or more receipt settings data that represents one or more automation settings data that represents one or more privacy settings data that represents one or more accounts data that represents one or more users data that represents other information combinations thereof or the like. These and other types of preferences will be described in further detail below.

The identifiers can include data that identifies a user account device or the like. Thus the identifiers shown as part of the preferences can include the identifiers and or other types of identifiers information or other data that can identify users accounts devices or the like. In some embodiments the identifiers included in the preferences can be associated with and or can be referenced by the identifiers identified by the computing device or other devices. Thus according to various embodiments of the concepts and technologies described herein the point of sale customization service can obtain an identifier from the computing device the user device the point of sale module or another entity and obtain by searching the preferences using the identifier one or more preferences . It should be understood that this example is illustrative and therefore should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

The payment method preferences can include data that describes or represents one or more payment accounts such as for example one or more bank accounts one or more credit card accounts one or more other accounts e.g. a wireless account other payment accounts or methods combinations thereof or the like as well as preferences for using the one or more payment accounts. The payment method preferences can be stored using various types of encryption to prevent or reduce the risk of malicious activity such as identity theft. Thus the payment method preferences can be used to represent various payment methods as well as preferences for using or applying the various payment methods. In some embodiments the payment method preferences can define dollar amounts locations or other thresholds that can be used to modify which payment method is used for a particular transaction based upon amount location user merchant combinations thereof or the like.

The language preferences can include data that can specify one or more languages for transactions preferences for what languages are used and or where the languages are used combinations thereof or the like. The language preferences can be provided to and or used by the point of sale application to configure output at the point of sale module or elsewhere during a transaction. Thus for example if a user specifies a language preference as English the point of sale application can modify a user interface presented at the point of sale module to present instructions or other information in English or to use English without the user or other entity affirmatively choosing English from a list of available language options. Additionally users can specify various languages and or preferences for various reasons. For example a user may decide to use a foreign language to increase privacy or security or for other reasons. The preferences can be used to specify when such languages may or may not be used. Because languages other than English are possible and are contemplated it should be understood that the above example is illustrative and therefore should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

The security preferences can specify various security settings for use during transactions. The security preferences can include for example data specifying encryption preferences and or technologies supplemental authentication settings e.g. personal identification numbers PINs or other passcodes secondary authentication settings or the like use of out of band authentication technologies combinations thereof or the like. The receipt preferences can include data that can specify a preference for printing receipts for emailing or otherwise transmitting receipts or combinations thereof. Thus the receipt preferences can specify if printed receipts or electronically delivered receipts or both are desired by a particular user. Or course the receipt preferences also can specify different preferences for different types of transactions times locations or the like. It should be understood that this example is illustrative and therefore should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

The automation preferences can be used to specify how application of the preferences or settings to the functionality of the point of sale customization service can be automated. Thus for example the user device can be configured via an application executed by the user device or other functionality to periodically search for a point of sale module that is enabled or supported by a point of sale application such as the point of sale application . As such the automation preferences can be used to support customization of the point of sale module as illustrated and described herein in an automated fashion without requiring user input at the point of sale. Thus for example the automation preferences can specify whether or not the user device is discoverable whether preferences should be loaded to the point of sale module without user input combinations thereof or the like. Because the automation preferences can include settings or preferences for automating other aspects of point of sale customization it should be understood that these examples are illustrative and therefore should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

The privacy preferences can specify various privacy settings that can be applied to transactions. The privacy preferences can indicate for example what information can or cannot be shared with a merchant during completion of the transaction. In some embodiments for example the privacy preferences can specify what information other than transaction particulars may or may not be shared with the point of sale module and or the computing device to which the point of sale module is connected. As such a user or other entity can specify via the privacy settings whether transactions are to be completed anonymously whether personal information can be shared with merchants if email addresses can be shared what protocols are allowed for data communications combinations thereof or the like. Because the privacy preferences can specify other aspects of transactions that may or may not be shared it should be understood that these examples are illustrative and therefore should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

The accounts information can specify one or more user accounts associated with the point of sale customization service . In some embodiments a device such as the user device may be used by multiple users and therefore may be associated with multiple accounts or users. Thus the account information can specify one or more accounts associated with the user device and or identifiers associated with the user device . Similarly the user information can specify one or more users associated with the user device and or the point of sale customization service . These and other data can be used to allow association of multiple accounts and users with a particular device identifier payment method or the like.

The other data can specify any other preferences or settings associated with the point of sale customization service . For example the other data can be used to define transaction amount limits location thresholds goods and services limits or the like. As such the other data can be used to limit what types of transactions can or cannot be completed by specific users or devices and or can specify additional actions e.g. entry of a secondary or supplemental password to allow a particular transaction. The other data also can be used to specify what types of communication protocols are allowed limited or the like.

In some embodiments the other data also can include reminders. The reminders can be generated to remind a user or other entity to purchase a particular good or service when in the range of a particular point of sale module or point of sale application associated with an entity that sells the particular good or service. The other data also can define one or more profiles for the preferences . As used herein a profile can refer to a group or set of preferences for a user account device or the like. A user device account or the like can have multiple profiles in some embodiments. Thus a user may have a first profile for a first type of transaction a second profile for a second type of transaction or the like. The types of transactions can include dollar amounts associated with the profiles locations associated with the profiles times of day or the like. In some embodiments a user may have multiple profiles and may be given the opportunity to select a profile for use during a particular transaction without basing this selection on any particular consideration other than the user s choice.

In some other embodiments the profiles can be automatically selected based upon transaction details. In one example embodiment a user may have a first profile that specifies a first set of preferences for a transaction under a dollar threshold such as one hundred dollars two hundred dollars four hundred fifty dollars or the like and a second profile for transactions over the dollar threshold. Thus a user may apply certain security payment privacy or other preferences if over the dollar threshold and or other security payment privacy or other preferences if under the dollar threshold. Other types of thresholds can be specified if desired. Additionally as noted above users or other entities can be given the opportunity or ability to select a profile based upon any considerations with or without any thresholds.

The other data also can be used to define user interfaces. For example the other data can define button locations captions instructions and or user interface layouts for the user or other entity. Thus while some point of sale devices or systems may differ with respect to one another and therefore the locations and or captions of controls on a user interface associated with the point of sale systems may differ the concepts and technologies described herein can be used to define button or caption locations contents and or actions triggered by the buttons or controls associated with the captions. Thus for example a user may define particular buttons locations captions or the like to provide a relatively uniform payment process at various point of sale devices and or systems according to some embodiments. Because the other data can include other information as illustrated and described herein it should be understood that these examples are illustrative and therefore should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

In practice the point of sale customization service can obtain user data from one or more sources. According to various embodiments the point of sale customization service can obtain the user data via interactions with a user device for example via a web portal a web application a standalone application executed by the user device combinations thereof or the like. Thus a user or other entity can interact with the point of sale customization service to create the user data and or to provide the user data to the point of sale customization service .

In some other embodiments the point of sale customization service can obtain the user data from the computing device which as explained above can be associated with a particular point of sale or other location. According to some embodiments a user or other entity can interact with a point of sale module during a transaction and can specify via one or more interactions that the transaction settings should be stored for future use or application to future transactions. The point of sale application can capture the transaction information e.g. payment method language preference or the like as the user data and can provide the user data to the point of sale customization service . Thus the user data can be used to create preferences associated with a particular user account device or the like using embodiments of the concepts and technologies described herein.

Regardless of how the point of sale customization service receives the user data the point of sale customization service can analyze the user data and can extract from the user data one or more preferences such as payment preferences or the like. The user data also can include or can be transmitted with one or more identifiers which as explained above can be used to identify a particular device such as the user device . In some embodiments the identifier can be captured by the point of sale module for example via communication with an NFC device or the like. Thus the point of sale customization service can also extract from the user data or receive the identifier and can associate the one or more preferences extracted from the user data with the identifier .

As shown in the point of sale customization service can store point of sale preferences for various users devices and or accounts as the preferences and the preferences can include but are not limited to the various types of information shown in . A user or other entity can interact with the point of sale customization service to modify or supplement the preferences at almost any time. Some example user interfaces for modifying the preferences are illustrated and described herein with reference to .

At some time a device such as the user device can enter a proximity of the point of sale module . The point of sale module can identify the user device for example via communicating with the user device via a wired connection WiFi connections BLUETOOTH connections ZIGBEE connections NFC connections or other wired wireless optical short range and or long range communications. Upon recognizing the user device in the proximity of the point of sale module the point of sale module or the point of sale application can capture an identifier associated with the user device such as the identifier shown in . In various embodiments the identifier can be unique to a particular device user account or the like.

The computing device can via execution of the point of sale application transmit the identifier to the point of sale customization service . The point of sale customization service can search the preferences using the identifier to determine if preferences associated with the identifier are stored. The preferences associated with the identifier can be identified e.g. via a database query executed against the preferences by the point of sale customization service and provided to the point of sale application .

The point of sale application can apply the preferences to a transaction occurring via the point of sale application and or via a point of sale module associated with the point of sale application . Thus the point of sale application can apply to a transaction occurring via the point of sale application and or the point of sale module the preferences associated with a user device being used to conduct the transaction and or in proximity of the point of sale module during the transaction. Based upon the various types of preferences that can be stored by the point of sale customization service it can be appreciated that the point of sale application and or the point of sale module can apply various types of preferences to the transaction and or other activities occurring in association with the transaction e.g. actions before during or after the transaction . Thus the point of sale application and or the point of sale module can apply language preferences payment preferences security preferences receipt preferences automation preferences privacy preferences account information user information other information or the like to the transactions.
