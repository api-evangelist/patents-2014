Various embodiments provide an assist circuit that may be coupled to one or more components of a memory system to selectively lower a supply voltage that is delivered to the component. For example the assist circuit may be coupled to a plurality of bitcells e.g. register file bitcells . The assist circuit may selectively lower the supply voltage delivered to the plurality of bitcells during at least a portion of a write operation to provide a reduced write minimum voltage Vmin for the bitcells and or to allow passgate transistors with higher threshold voltages to be used in the bitcells. Additionally or alternatively the assist circuit may selectively lower the supply voltage during an inactive state of the bitcells to reduce a leakage current of the bitcells and or mitigate the impact of aging on the transistors of the bitcells.

In some embodiments the assist circuit may additionally or alternatively be coupled to a read circuit that is coupled to the bitcells and or to a read only memory ROM circuit. The assist circuit may selectively lower a supply voltage delivered to the read circuit during an inactive state of the read circuit.

In various embodiments the assist circuit may include one or more diodes e.g. diode connected transistors coupled between a main supply rail and a supply node of the component to which the assist circuit is coupled e.g. the bitcells and or read circuit . The assist circuit may further include a transistor coupled in parallel with the one or more diodes between the main supply rail and the supply node. The transistor may receive a control signal to turn the transistor on or off to selectively lower the voltage at the supply node of the component.

The assist circuit may include a diode coupled between the main supply rail and the supply node . The diode may be a diode connected transistor such as a diode connected n type metal oxide semiconductor NMOS . The assist circuit may further include a transistor coupled in parallel with the diode between the main supply rail and the supply node . In some embodiments the transistor may be a p type transistor such as a p type metal oxide semiconductor PMOS although other types of transistors may be used in other embodiments. The transistor may receive a control signal to turn the transistor on or off to selectively provide a conductive path between the main supply rail and the supply node via the transistor e.g. around the diode .

In various embodiments the assist circuit may be used to control a voltage CVcc at the supply node . For example when the transistor is turned off the voltage CVcc may settle to a voltage level that is lower than the main supply voltage Vcc for example a voltage level approximately equal to the main supply voltage Vcc less the voltage drop provided by the diode e.g. the threshold voltage Vt of the diode . When the transistor is turned on the voltage CVcc at the supply node may settle to a voltage level approximately equal to the main supply voltage Vcc. Accordingly the assist circuit may be used to selectively provide a voltage level at the supply node that is less than the main supply voltage Vcc as further discussed herein.

In some embodiments the assist circuit may include one or more additional diodes e.g. diode connected transistors coupled in series with the diode between the main supply rail and the supply node . For example illustrates an assist circuit including two diodes coupled in series between a main supply rail and a supply node . A transistor may be coupled in parallel with the diodes between the main supply rail and the supply node . Other embodiments of the assist circuit may include any suitable number of one or more diodes . The number of diodes may be selected based on a desired voltage drop for the voltage CVcc at the supply node compared with the main supply voltage Vcc at the main supply rail when the transistor is off.

Referring again to in some embodiments the bitcells may be register file bitcells of a register file array. For example the bitcells may be 8 T bitcells e.g. including 8 transistors as shown in . Other embodiments may include other types of bitcells. For example bitcells with a plurality of read ports and or write ports may be used in some embodiments.

As shown in the bitcells may include a pair of pull up transistors e.g. pull up transistor and pull up transistor and a pair of pull down transistors e.g. pull down transistor and pull down transistor arranged as cross coupled inverters. For example the drain terminal of the pull up transistor may be coupled to a drain terminal of the pull down transistor and the drain terminal of the pull up transistor may be coupled to the drain terminal of the pull down transistor . Additionally the gate terminals of the pull up transistor and the pull down transistor may be coupled to a bit node between the pull up transistor and the pull down transistor and the gate terminals of the pull up transistor and the pull down transistor may be coupled to a complementary bit bitx node between the pull up transistor and the pull down transistor . The source terminals of the pull up transistors and may be coupled to one another and to the supply node . The source terminals of the pull down transistors and may be coupled to a ground terminal . In some embodiments the pull up transistors and may be PMOS transistors and the pull down transistors and may be NMOS transistors.

The individual bitcells may store a value of a bit e.g. a logic 1 or a logic 0 based on a voltage level at the bit node between pull up transistor and pull down transistor . For example the bit node may have a first voltage level e.g. Vcc to indicate that the bit has a logic 1 or a second voltage level e.g. 0 volts or ground to indicate that the bit has a logic 0. Additionally the bitx node between pull up transistor and pull down transistor may store a complementary bit bitx having the opposite logical value from the logical value of the bit stored at the bit node . Accordingly the bitx node may have the second voltage level when the bit node has the first voltage level and may have the first voltage level when the bit node has the second voltage level.

A passgate transistor may be coupled between the bit node and a write bit line WBL . Additionally a passgate transistor may be coupled between the bitx node and a complementary write bit line WBLX . The gate terminals of the passgate transistors and may be coupled to a write word line WWL to receive a WWL signal. The WWL signal may turn on the passgate transistors and during a write operation of the bitcell and may turn off the passgate transistors and during an inactive state of the bitcell . During the write operation the bitcell may write a bit to the bit node based on a WBL signal received at the WBL . Additionally the bitcell may write a complementary bit to the bitx node based on a WBLX signal received at the WBLX .

In some embodiments the plurality of bitcells coupled to the assist circuit may be associated with a same block e.g. a column of a memory device. In some embodiments the plurality of bitcells coupled to the assist circuit may all receive the same WWL signal. The memory device may include a plurality of blocks of bitcells and separate assist circuits may be coupled to the respective blocks of bitcells.

In some embodiments the individual bitcells may further include a read port coupled to the bit node . The read port may include NMOS transistors and . A gate terminal of NMOS transistor may be coupled to the bit node . The NMOS transistor may be coupled between the NMOS transistor and a local read bit line LBL . The gate terminal of the NMOS transistor may be coupled to a read word line RWL to receive a RWL signal. The RWL signal may selectively activate a read operation of the bitcell .

In various embodiments the control signal may turn off the transistor of the assist circuit for at least a portion of the write operation of the bitcell . Turning off the transistor may cause the voltage level at the supply node to float. The supply node may settle at a voltage level that is less than the main supply voltage Vcc by the threshold voltage Vt of the diode e.g. CVcc Vcc Vt . The lower voltage during the write operation may provide a lower write Vmin for the bitcell . Alternatively the lower voltage during the write operation may allow the use of passgate transistors and with higher threshold voltages thereby providing lower leakage current for the bitcell .

In some embodiments the transistor may be turned off for a first portion of the write operation and then turned on for a second portion of the write operation. During the first portion of the write operation the lower voltage at the supply node provided by the assist circuit may reduce the drive strength of the pull up transistors and thereby reducing the contention provided by the pull up transistors and to the passgate transistors and respectively. The reduced contention may allow the value of the bit to be flipped e.g. from a 0 to a 1 or from a 1 to a 0 at lower values of the main supply voltage Vcc than for circuits that do not include the assist circuit . Accordingly the assist circuit may reduce the write Vmin which may correspond to a minimum value of the main supply voltage Vcc at which the bitcell can reliably write data across process voltage and temperature PVT corners.

When the transistor turns on during the second portion of the write operation the voltage level at the supply node may increase to be at or near the main supply voltage Vcc. This may cause the voltage level at the bit node to rise to Vcc if the bit being written is a logic 1 or it may cause the voltage level at the bitx node to rise to Vcc if the bit being written is a logic 0 thereby completing the transition.

For example illustrates sample waveforms that may be used by the memory circuit of for example during a write operation to write a logic 1 bit to the bitcell where the bitcell previously stored a logic 0 bit. shows a WWL signal that may be received at the WWL of bitcell a control signal that may be received at the gate terminal of the transistor of the assist circuit a CVcc voltage at the supply node a bit voltage at the bit node and a bitx voltage at the bitx node . The CVcc voltage bit voltage and bitx voltage are shown with respect to reference lines indicating the first voltage level Vcc and the second voltage level GND ground . The write operation may start at a time t and may end at a time t after the time t.

Prior to time t the control signal may be at a first logic level and the transistor may be on. Accordingly the CVcc voltage may be at Vcc and the diode may be off.

At time t the WWL signal may transition from a logic low voltage to a logic high voltage to initiate the write operation. Additionally the WBL signal not shown in may be a logic high voltage to write a logic 1 bit to the bit node of the bitcell and the WBLX signal not shown in may be a logic low voltage to write a logic 0 complementary bit bitx .

In some embodiments the control signal may turn the transistor off for a first time period of the write operation and may turn the transistor on for a second time period of the write operation that occurs later in time than the first time period . For example the control signal may transition from a logic low voltage to a logic high voltage at time t to turn off the transistor and then transition back to the logic low voltage at the end of the first time period to turn the transistor on.

When the transistor turns off at the beginning of the write operation the CVcc voltage at the supply node may decrease since the diode and the transistor may be off. The CVcc voltage may decrease until the diode turns on e.g. when the gate source voltage Vgs of the diode reaches the threshold voltage Vt of the diode . The CVcc voltage may settle at a voltage level approximately equal to Vcc Vt. Additionally the bit voltage may transition from ground to the CVcc voltage. As discussed above the lower CVcc voltage may reduce the drive strength of the pull up transistors and which may provide a lower Vmin for the bitcell .

When the transistor turns on during the second time period of the write operation the CVcc voltage may increase to Vcc. The increased CVcc voltage may cause the bit voltage to increase to Vcc also thereby completing the transition from the logic 0 bit to the logic 1 bit.

As discussed above the reduced CVcc voltage during the first time period may provide a lower write Vmin for the bitcell compared with prior memory circuits that do not include the assist circuit . Alternatively the reduced CVcc voltage during the first time period may allow the use of passgate transistors and with higher threshold voltages for a given write Vmin of the bitcell compared with prior memory circuits that do not include the assist circuit .

In various embodiments any suitable relative length of the first time period and or second time period may be used. In some embodiments a relative length of the first time period and or second time period may be selected to provide the decreased write Vmin and or allow for passgate transistors and with higher threshold voltages while also complying with a phase delay requirement for the bitcell . For example in some embodiments a length of the second time period may be about 0 to about 90 of a length of the write operation such as about 10 to about 40 of the length of the write operation. In other embodiments the transistor of the assist circuit may be off for the entire length of the write operation e.g. the length of the second time period may be 0 of the length of the write operation . The length of the write operation may correspond to a length of time that the WWL signal has the logic high voltage before transitioning back to the logic low voltage e.g. t t .

In various embodiments in addition to or instead of turning the transistor off for at least a portion of the write operation of the bitcell the assist circuit may turn the transistor off during an inactive state of the plurality of bitcells . During the inactive state new data may not be written to the bitcells . In some embodiments data may also not be read from the bitcells during the inactive state e.g. in embodiments in which the assist circuit is also coupled to a read circuit as further discussed below with respect to .

With the transistor off the supply node may be powered via the diode and the CVcc voltage may be lower than the Vcc voltage at the main supply rail . The steady state CVcc voltage during the inactive state may be based on the leakage current of the bitcells and the threshold voltage of the diode . The lower CVcc voltage provided by the assist circuit may reduce the aging impact on the transistors of the bitcells .

The transistors of the bitcells especially the PMOS pull up transistors and may degrade over time which may degrade the retention Vmin of the bitcells . The impact on aging may be mitigated by turning off the transistor of the assist circuit during the inactive state of the bitcells . Additionally the lower CVcc voltage provided by the assist circuit may significantly reduce the leakage current of the bitcells e.g. in the write port of the bitcells including the passgate transistors and . For example in simulations of one embodiment the reduced CVcc voltage provided by the assist circuit reduced the leakage current of the bitcell by about 45 . When passgate transistors and of higher threshold voltage were used in the bitcell the leakage savings increased to about 62 .

In some embodiments the assist circuit discussed herein may be coupled to other components of a memory system to selectively lower the supply voltage delivered to the components of the memory system.

During the active state a Vcc merge voltage at the supply node may be approximately equal to the Vcc voltage at the main supply rail . Accordingly data may be read using the read circuit without interference from the assist circuit .

During the inactive state the Vcc merge voltage may be lower than the Vcc voltage at the main supply rail . The lower Vcc merge voltage may provide lower leakage current and reduced aging degradation for the read circuit . The read circuit may be placed in the inactive state for example when the bitcells associated with the read circuit are not selected for reading of data.

In embodiments when the same assist circuit is coupled to the read circuit to provide the Vcc merge voltage and to the bitcells to provide the CVcc voltage the read circuit may be placed in the inactive state when the bitcells associated with the read circuit are not selected for reading or writing of data. In these embodiments when data is written to the bitcells the control signal may control the transistor of the assist circuit as described herein for the write operation.
