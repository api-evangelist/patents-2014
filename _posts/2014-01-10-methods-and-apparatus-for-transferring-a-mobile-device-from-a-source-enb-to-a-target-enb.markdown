This application is a continuation of co pending commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 949 616 entitled METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR TRANSFERRING A MOBILE DEVICE FROM A SOURCE eNB TO A TARGET eNB which was filed Dec. 3 2007 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60 868 488 entitled ENHANCED RLC STATUS REPORTING FOR LTE which was filed Dec. 4 2006. The entirety of the aforementioned applications are herein incorporated by reference.

The following description relates generally to wireless communications and more particularly to providing a mechanism for transferring a mobile device from a source enhanced node B eNB to a target eNB.

Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various types of communication content such as voice data and so on. These systems may be multiple access systems capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing the available system resources e.g. bandwidth and transmit power . Examples of such multiple access systems include code division multiple access CDMA systems time division multiple access TDMA systems frequency division multiple access FDMA systems 3GPP LTE systems and orthogonal frequency division multiple access OFDMA systems.

Generally a wireless multiple access communication system can simultaneously support communication for multiple wireless terminals. Each terminal communicates with one or more base stations via transmissions on the forward and reverse links. The forward link or downlink refers to the communication link from the base stations to the terminals and the reverse link or uplink refers to the communication link from the terminals to the base stations. This communication link may be established via a single in single out SISO multiple in signal out MISO or a multiple in multiple out MIMO system.

Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various types of communication content such as for example voice data and so on. Typical wireless communication systems may be multiple access systems capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources e.g. bandwidth transmit power . . . . Examples of such multiple access systems may include code division multiple access CDMA systems time division multiple access TDMA systems frequency division multiple access FDMA systems 3GPP LTE systems orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM localized frequency division multiplexing LFDM orthogonal frequency division multiple access OFDMA systems and the like.

In a wireless communication system a Node B or base station or enhanced Node B eNB may transmit data to a user equipment UE on the downlink and or receive data from the UE on the uplink. The downlink or forward link refers to the communication link from the eNB to the UE and the uplink or reverse link refers to the communication link from the UE to the Node B. The eNB may also send control information e.g. assignments of system resources to the UE. Similarly the UE may send control information to the eNB to support data transmission on the downlink and or for other purposes. As the mobile device is moved it is desirable to switch eNBs. For example the mobile device is in communication with a source eNB and then the device is approaching another eNB the target eNB and it is desirable to handover from the source to the target. This handover is also termed herein a re pointing.

In 3GPP LTE Long Term Evolution which is the name given to a project within the Third Generation Partnership Project to improve the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System UMTS mobile phone standard to cope with future requirements. In LTE it is currently agreed that during eNB re pointing the radio link control RLC Protocol Data Units PDU s will not be forwarded from the source eNB to the target eNB. Additionally the RLC can be reset at each eNB re pointing event. By reset it is meant that any RLC Service Data Units SDU s that were not completely delivered by RLC at the source eNB will need to be retransmitted at the target eNB.

Since RLC operation is not continuous at eNB re pointing special care need be taken to avoid wasting too much radio capacity and creating potential user plane interruption during the re pointing or transferring procedure.

The following presents a simplified summary of one or more embodiments in order to provide a basic understanding of such embodiments. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated embodiments and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all embodiments nor delineate the scope of any or all embodiments. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more embodiments in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

In accordance with one exemplary non limiting embodiment a method used in a wireless communication system including a plurality of cells the method includes transmitting to a mobile device from a source enhanced node B and sending a Packet Data Convergence Protocol PDCP status report to a target enhanced node B from the mobile device. Because the target enhanced node B receives the status report only the missing RLC SDUs PDCP packets need to be sent and this avoids transmitting duplicated RLC SDUs at the target eNB to the mobile device. In another exemplary non limiting embodiment a method includes transmitting to a mobile device from a source enhanced node B and sending a Packet Data Convergence Protocol PDCP status report to the source enhanced node B prior to a re pointing to a target enhanced node B.

The source enhanced node B can use a X2 logical network that connects the enhanced node Bs together to inform the target enhanced node B which PDCP packets to send. Accordingly a mobile device can be handed off from a source enhanced node B to a target enhanced node B with some of the RLC SDUs being sent to the mobile device from the source enhanced node B and some of the RLC SDUs being sent to the mobile device from the target enhanced node B. In one exemplary non limiting embodiment the source stops sending any RLC SDUs once the handoff begins. If the source enhanced node B receives the PDCP status report form the mobile device before re pointing the source enhanced node B does not need to forward the RLC SDUs that were already received by the mobile devices and this saves bandwidth of the X2 logical layer.

In accordance with an aspect apparatus includes a mobile device with a processor configured to send a Packet Data Convergence Protocol PDCP status report to a target enhanced node B after re pointing to the target enhanced node B. The processor is also configured to send at least one PDCP sequence number to the target enhanced node B. The processor is further configured to receive the RLC SDUs from a source enhanced node B and ignore the RLC SDUs from the source enhanced node B. The processor can be configured to send a handoff Confirm Message to the target enhanced node B.

The eNB transferring techniques from source to target described herein may be used for various wireless communication systems such as CDMA TDMA FDMA OFDMA and SC FDMA systems.

Cdma2000 covers IS 2000 IS 95 and IS 856 standards. A TDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Global System for Mobile Communications GSM . An OFDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Evolved UTRA E UTRA IEEE 802.11 IEEE 802.16 IEEE 802.20 Flash OFDM etc. These various radio technologies and standards are known in the art.

UTRA E UTRA and GSM are part of Universal Mobile Telecommunication System UMTS . Long Term Evolution LTE is an upcoming release of UMTS that uses E UTRA. UTRA E UTRA GSM UMTS and LTE are described in documents from an organization named 3rd Generation Partnership Project 3GPP . Cdma2000 is described in documents from an organization named 3rd Generation Partnership Project 16 3GPP2 . For clarity certain aspects of the techniques are described below for uplink transmission in LTE and 3GPP terminology is used in much of the description below.

LTE utilizes orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM on the downlink and single carrier frequency division multiplexing SC FDM on the uplink. OFDM and SC FDM partition the system bandwidth into multiple N orthogonal subcarriers which are also commonly referred to as tones bins etc. Each subcarrier may be modulated with data. In general modulation symbols are sent in the frequency domain with OFDM and in the time domain with SC FDM. For LTE the spacing between adjacent subcarriers may be fixed and the total number of subcarriers N may be dependent on the system bandwidth. In one design N 512 for a system bandwidth of 5 MHz N 1024 for a system bandwidth of 10 MHz and N 2048 for a system bandwidth of 20 MHz. In general N may be any integer value.

The system may support a frequency division duplex FDD mode and or a time division duplex TDD mode. In the FDD mode separate frequency channels may be used for the downlink and uplink and downlink transmissions and uplink transmissions may be sent concurrently on their separate frequency channels. In the TDD mode a common frequency channel may be used for both the downlink and uplink downlink transmissions may be sent in some time periods and uplink transmissions may be sent in other time periods. The LTE downlink transmission scheme is partitioned by radio frames e.g. 10 ms radio frame . Each frame comprises a pattern made of frequency e.g. sub carrier and time e.g. OFDM symbols . The 10 ms radio frame is divided into plurality of adjacent 0.5 ms sub frames also referred to as sub frames or timeslots and interchangeably used hereinafter . Each sub frame comprises plurality of resource blocks wherein each resource block made up of one or more sub carrier and one or more OFDM symbol. One or more resource blocks may be used for transmission of data control information pilot or any combination thereof.

A single frequency network or SFN is a broadcast network where several transmitters simultaneously send the same signal over the same frequency channel. Analog FM and AM radio broadcast networks as well as digital broadcast networks can operate in this manner. Analog television transmission has proven to be more difficult since the SFN results in ghosting due to echoes of the same signal.

In wideband digital broadcasting self interference cancellation is facilitated by the OFDM or COFDM modulation method. OFDM uses a large number of slow low bandwidth modulators instead of one fast wide band modulator. Each modulator has its own frequency sub channel and sub carrier frequency. Since each modulator is very slow we can afford to insert a guard interval between the symbols and thus eliminate the ISI. Although the fading is frequency selective over the whole frequency channel it can be considered as flat within the narrowband sub channel. Thus advanced equalization filters can be avoided. A forward error correction code FEC can counteract that a certain portion of the sub carriers are exposed to too much fading to be correctly demodulated.

OFDM is utilized in the terrestrial digital TV broadcasting systems such as DVB T and ISDB T. OFDM is also widely used in digital radio systems including DAB HD Radio and T DMB. Therefore these systems are well suited to SFN operation. The 8VSB modulation method used in North America for digital TV specified in ATSC standard A 110 may perhaps also allow the use of SFN transmission.

Through the use of virtual channel numbering a multi frequency network MFN can appear as an SFN to the viewer in ATSC. Alternatives to using OFDM modulation in SFN self interference cancellation would be CDMA Rake receivers. MIMO channels i.e. phased array antenna . Single carrier modulation in combination by guard intervals and frequency domain equalization. In a Single Frequency Network the transmitters and receivers are usually synchronized with the others using GPS or a signal from the main station or network as a reference clock. For example the use of a special marker can be employed the Mega frame Initialization Packet MIP that is inserted in the bit stream at a central distribution point and signals the SFN transmitters the absolute time as read from a GPS receiver at which this point in the data stream is to be broadcast.

Referring to a multiple access wireless communication system according to one embodiment is illustrated. An access point AP includes multiple antenna groups one including and another including and and an additional including and . In only two antennas are shown for each antenna group however more or fewer antennas may be utilized for each antenna group. Access terminal AT is in communication with antennas and where antennas and transmit information to access terminal over forward link and receive information from access terminal over reverse link . Access terminal is in communication with antennas and where antennas and transmit information to access terminal over forward link and receive information from access terminal over reverse link . Access terminals and can be UEs. In a FDD system communication links and may use different frequency for communication. For example forward link may use a different frequency than that used by reverse link .

Each group of antennas and or the area in which they are designed to communicate is often referred to as a sector of the access point. In the embodiment antenna groups each are designed to communicate to access terminals in a sector of the areas covered by access point .

In communication over forward links and the transmitting antennas of access point utilize beam forming in order to improve the signal to noise ratio of forward links for the different access terminals and . Also an access point using beam forming to transmit to access terminals scattered randomly through its coverage causes less interference to access terminals in neighboring cells than an access point transmitting through a single antenna to all its access terminals.

An access point may be a fixed station used for communicating with the terminals and may also be referred to as an access point a Node B an enhanced node B eNB or some other terminology. An access terminal may also be called an access terminal user equipment UE a wireless communication device terminal access terminal or some other terminology.

In an embodiment each data stream is transmitted over a respective transmit antenna. TX data processor formats codes and interleaves the traffic data for each data stream based on a particular coding scheme selected for that data stream to provide coded data.

The coded data for each data stream may be multiplexed with pilot data using FORM techniques. The pilot data is typically a known data pattern that is processed in a known manner and may be used at the receiver system to estimate the channel response. The multiplexed pilot and coded data for each data stream is then modulated i.e. symbol mapped based on a particular modulation scheme e.g. BASK ASK M PSF or M QAM selected for that data stream to provide modulation symbols. The data rate coding and modulation for each data stream may be determined by instructions performed by processor .

The modulation symbols for all data streams are then provided to a TX MIMO processor which may further process the modulation symbols e.g. for OFDM . TX MIMO processor then provides Nmodulation symbol streams to Ntransmitters TMTR through . In certain embodiments TX MIMO processor applies beam forming weights to the symbols of the data streams and to the antenna from which the symbol is being transmitted.

Each transmitter receives and processes a respective symbol stream to provide one or more analog signals and further conditions e.g. amplifies filters and up converts the analog signals to provide a modulated signal suitable for transmission over the MIMO channel. Nmodulated signals from transmitters through are then transmitted from Nantennas through respectively.

At receiver system the transmitted modulated signals are received by Nantennas through and the received signal from each antenna is provided to a respective receiver RCVR through . Each receiver conditions e.g. filters amplifies and down converts a respective received signal digitizes the conditioned signal to provide samples and further processes the samples to provide a corresponding received symbol stream.

An RX data processor then receives and processes the Nreceived symbol streams from Nreceivers based on a particular receiver processing technique to provide N detected symbol streams. The RX data processor then demodulates deinterleaves and decodes each detected symbol stream to recover the traffic data for the data stream. The processing by RX data processor is complementary to that performed by TX MIMO processor and TX data processor at transmitter system . A processor periodically determines which pre coding matrix to use. Processor formulates a reverse link message comprising a matrix index portion and a rank value portion.

The reverse link message may comprise various types of information regarding the communication link and or the received data stream. The reverse link message is then processed by a TX data processor which also receives traffic data for a number of data streams from a data source modulated by a modulator conditioned by transmitters through and transmitted back to transmitter system .

At transmitter system the modulated signals from receiver system are received by antennas conditioned by receivers demodulated by a demodulator and processed by a RX data processor to extract the reserve link message transmitted by the receiver system . Processor then determines which pre coding matrix to use for determining the beam forming weights then processes the extracted message.

In an aspect logical channels are classified into Control Channels and Traffic Channels. Logical Control Channels comprises Broadcast Control Channel BCCH that is DL channel for broadcasting system control information. Paging Control Channel PCCH which is DL channel that transfers paging information. Multicast Control Channel MCCH which is Point to multipoint DL channel used for transmitting Multimedia Broadcast and Multicast Service MBMS scheduling and control information for one or several MTCHs. Generally after establishing a Radio Resource Control RRC connection this channel is only used by UEs that receive MBMS Note old MCCH MSCH . Dedicated Control Channel DCCH is Point to point bi directional channel that transmits dedicated control information and used by UEs having an RRC connection. In aspect Logical Traffic Channels comprise a Dedicated Traffic Channel DTCH that is Point to point bi directional channel dedicated to one UE for the transfer of user information. Also a Multicast Traffic Channel MTCH for Point to multipoint DL channel for transmitting traffic data.

In an aspect Transport Channels are classified into DL and UL. DL Transport Channels comprises a Broadcast Channel BCH Downlink Shared Data Channel DL SDCH and a Paging Channel PCH the PCH for support of UE power saving DRX cycle is indicated by the network to the UE broadcasted over entire cell and mapped to PHY resources which can be used for other control traffic channels. The UL Transport Channels comprises a Random Access Channel RACH a Request Channel REQCH an Uplink Shared Data Channel UL SDCH and plurality of PHY channels. The PHY channels comprise a set of DL channels and UL channels.

In an aspect a channel structure is provided that preserves low signal peak to average PAR values and at any given time the channel is contiguous or uniformly spaced in frequency that is a desired property of a single carrier waveform.

The RLC PDU structure where the PDU sequence number carried by the RLC header is independent of the SDU sequence number i. e. PDCP sequence number is shown in where a dotted line indicates the occurrence of a segmentation. The segmentation end at a dotted line . Because the segmentation only occurs when needed and concatenation is done in sequence the content of an RLC PDU can generally be described by the following relations 

Referring now to an environment includes UEs synced at to a source eNB and a target eNB . In 1 the PDCP status report is sent right after the handover command HO before the UE has re pointed to the target eNB. This method is natural to perform in PDCP as the illustrations of allow all radio bearers to synchronize before the SDUs are forwarded from the source eNB to the target eNB. For this operation a regular PDCP status report containing RLC SDU information can be used.

One disadvantage of this method is that a UE re points to a new eNB when the existing radio link with the source eNB is fading away. Under these conditions it is sensible to trigger the re pointing procedure as soon as possible and avoid sending important signaling information over a fading link as it will waste radio resources and delay the procedure. One advantage of this method is that since the source eNB receives the status report before the re pointing it can avoid forwarding useless RLC SDUs to the target eNB and thus save X2 bandwidth.

In 2 the PDCP status report is sent to the target eNB after the UE has completed the re pointing procedure. The RLC PDU information carried in regular RLC status reports from the UE source eNB link is not relevant to the UE target eNB link and thus it cannot be reused directly. Instead the present disclosure proposes the PDCP status report to contain RLC SDU information that is relevant to both the source and target eNBs. An example of such information is the PDCP sequence number that is appended to RLC SDUs by PDCP and constant across eNBs.

One disadvantage of this method is since the source eNB is not aware of the latest status of the UE receiver it may forward useless RLC SDUs over the X2 interface to the target eNB. These useless SDUs will however not be forwarded over the air because the target eNB will receive the PDCP status report and synchronize it transmitter to the UE receiver.

One advantage of this method is the re pointing procedure is not delayed by the transmission of the PDCP status report on a fading link. The new status report is instead transmitted to the target eNB that is the new best current radio link.

While for purposes of simplicity of explanation the methodologies are shown and described as a series of acts it is to be understood and appreciated that the methodologies are not limited by the order of acts as some acts may in accordance with the claimed subject matter occur in different orders and or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein. For example those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events such as in a state diagram. Moreover not all illustrated acts may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with the claimed subject matter.

For a multiple access system e.g. FDMA OFDMA CDMA TDMA etc. multiple terminals can transmit concurrently on the uplink. For such a system the pilot subbands may be shared among different terminals. The channel estimation techniques may be used in cases where the pilot subbands for each terminal span the entire operating band possibly except for the band edges . Such a pilot subband structure would be desirable to obtain frequency diversity for each terminal. The techniques described herein may be implemented by various means. For example these techniques may be implemented in hardware software or a combination thereof. For a hardware implementation which may be digital analog or both digital and analog the processing units used for channel estimation may be implemented within one or more application specific integrated circuits ASICs digital signal processors DSPs digital signal processing devices DSPDs programmable logic devices PLDs field programmable gate arrays FPGAs processors controllers micro controllers microprocessors other electronic units designed to perform the functions described herein or a combination thereof. With software implementation can be through modules e.g. procedures functions and so on that perform the functions described herein. The software codes may be stored in memory unit and executed by the processors.

It is to be understood that the embodiments described herein may be implemented in hardware software firmware middleware microcode or any combination thereof. For a hardware implementation the processing units may be implemented within one or more application specific integrated circuits ASICs digital signal processors DSPs digital signal processing devices DSPDs programmable logic devices PLDs field programmable gate arrays FPGAs processors controllers micro controllers microprocessors other electronic units designed to perform the functions described herein or a combination thereof.

Terminals are typically dispersed throughout the system and each terminal may be fixed or mobile. A terminal may also be called a mobile station user equipment a user device or some other terminology. A terminal may be a wireless device a cellular phone a personal digital assistant PDA a wireless modem card and so on. Each terminal may communicate with zero one or multiple base stations on the downlink and uplink at any given moment. The downlink or forward link refers to the communication link from the base stations to the terminals and the uplink or reverse link refers to the communication link from the terminals to the base stations.

For a centralized architecture a system controller couples to base stations and provides coordination and control for base stations . For a distributed architecture base stations may communicate with one another as needed. Data transmission on the forward link occurs from one access point to one access terminal at or near the maximum data rate that can be supported by the forward link and or the communication system. Additional channels of the forward link e.g. control channel may be transmitted from multiple access points to one access terminal. Reverse link data communication may occur from one access terminal to one or more access points. One mobile device is leaving and approaching . So eNB is the source eNB and is the target eNB. The PDCP status report is sent to the target eNB after the UE has completed the re pointing procedure. Or the PDCP status report can be sent to the target eNB before the UE has completed the re pointing procedure. The RLC PDU information carried in regular status reports from the UE source eNB link is not relevant to the UE target eNB link and thus it cannot be reused directly. Instead the present disclosure proposes the PDCP status report to contain SDU information that is relevant to both the source and target eNBs. An example of such information is the PDCP sequence number that is appended to RLC SDUs by PDCP and constant across eNBs.

When the embodiments are implemented in software firmware middleware or microcode program code or code segments they may be stored in a machine readable medium such as a storage component. A code segment may represent a procedure a function a subprogram a program a routine a subroutine a module a software package a class or any combination of instructions data structures or program statements. A code segment may be coupled to another code segment or a hardware circuit by passing and or receiving information data arguments parameters or memory contents. Information arguments parameters data etc. may be passed forwarded or transmitted using any suitable means including memory sharing message passing token passing network transmission etc.

For a software implementation the techniques described herein may be implemented with modules e.g. procedures functions and so on that perform the functions described herein. The software codes may be stored in memory units and executed by processors. The memory unit may be implemented within the processor or external to the processor in which case it can be communicatively coupled to the processor via various means as is known in the art.

Because at least a portion of the communication between the device and the SFNs are wireless the security layer is provided in one exemplary generalized non limiting embodiment. The security layer can be used to cryptographically protect e.g. encrypt data as well as to digitally sign data to enhance security and unwanted unintentional or malicious disclosure. In operation the security component or layer can communicate data to from both the enhanced node Bs and and the mobile device .

An encryption component can be used to cryptographically protect data during transmission as well as while stored. The encryption component employs an encryption algorithm to encode data for security purposes. The algorithm is essentially a formula that is used to turn data into a secret code. Each algorithm uses a string of bits known as a key to perform the calculations. The larger the key e.g. the more bits in the key the greater the number of potential patterns can be created thus making it harder to break the code and descramble the contents of the data.

Most encryption algorithms use the block cipher method which code fixed blocks of input that are typically from 64 to 128 bits in length. A decryption component can be used to convert encrypted data back to its original form. In one aspect a public key can be used to encrypt data upon transmission to a storage device. Upon retrieval the data can be decrypted using a private key that corresponds to the public key used to encrypt.

A signature component can be used to digitally sign data and documents when transmitting and or retrieving from the device . It is to be understood that a digital signature or certificate guarantees that a file has not been altered similar to if it were carried in an electronically sealed envelope. The signature is an encrypted digest e.g. one way hash function used to confirm authenticity of data. Upon accessing the data the recipient can decrypt the digest and also re compute the digest from the received file or data. If the digests match the file is proven to be intact and tamper free. In operation digital certificates issued by a certification authority are most often used to ensure authenticity of a digital signature.

Still further the security layer can employ contextual awareness e.g. context awareness component to enhance security. For example the contextual awareness component can be employed to monitor and detect criteria associated with data transmitted to and requested from the device . In operation these contextual factors can be used to filter spam control retrieval e.g. access to highly sensitive data from a public network or the like. It will be understood that in aspects the contextual awareness component can employ logic that regulates transmission and or retrieval of data in accordance with external criteria and factors. The contextual awareness employment can be used in connection with an artificial intelligence AI layer .

The AI layer or component can be employed to facilitate inferring and or determining when where how to dynamically vary the level of security and or vary how PDCP information should be sent to the target eNB and or the source eNB and whether the PDCP information is to be sent before or after the UE has completed the re pointing procedure. Because there are tradeoffs regarding duplicate or wasted RLC SDUs being sent from the source eNB to the mobile device that will ignore them because the mobile device will receive the RLC SDUs from the new target eNB dependent on network resource factors it may be desirable to determine on the fly as to what information is sent to which eNB. Such inference results in the construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events and or stored event data whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity and whether the events and data come from one or several event s and data source s .

The AI component can also employ any of a variety of suitable AI based schemes in connection with facilitating various aspects of the herein described innovation. Classification can employ a probabilistic and or statistical based analysis e.g. factoring into the analysis utilities and costs to prognose or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed. The AI layer can be used in conjunction with the security layer to infer changes in the data being transferred and make recommendations to the security layer as to what level of security to apply.

For example a support vector machine SVM classifier can be employed. Other classification approaches include Bayesian networks decision trees and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence can be employed. Classification as used herein also is inclusive of statistical regression that is utilized to develop models of priority.

Additionally the sensor can be employed in conjunction with the security layer . Still further human authentication factors can be used to enhance security employing sensor . For instance biometrics e.g. fingerprints retinal patterns facial recognition DNA sequences handwriting analysis voice recognition can be employed to enhance authentication to control access of a storage vault. It will be understood that embodiments can employ multiple factor tests in authenticating identity of a user.

The sensor can also be used to provide the security layer with generalized non human metric data such as electromagnetic field condition data or predicted weather data etc. For example any conceivable condition can be sensed for and security levels can be adjusted or determined in response to the sensed condition.

It can also be appreciated that an object such as can be hosted on another computing device etc. or etc. Thus although the physical environment depicted can show the connected devices as computers such illustration is merely exemplary and the physical environment can alternatively be depicted or described comprising various digital devices such as PDAs televisions MP3 players etc. any of which can employ a variety of wired and wireless services software objects such as interfaces COM objects and the like.

There are a variety of systems components and network configurations that support distributed computing environments. For example computing systems can be connected together by wired or wireless systems by local networks or widely distributed networks. Currently many of the networks are coupled to the Internet which provides an infrastructure for widely distributed computing and encompasses many different networks. Any of the infrastructures can be used for exemplary communications made incident to optimization algorithms and processes according to the present innovation.

In home networking environments there are at least four disparate network transport media that can each support a unique protocol such as Power line data both wireless and wired voice e.g. telephone and entertainment media. Most home control devices such as light switches and appliances can use power lines for connectivity. Data Services can enter the home as broadband e.g. either DSL or Cable modem and are accessible within the home using either wireless e.g. HomeRF or 802.11A B G or wired e.g. Home PNA Cat 5 Ethernet even power line connectivity. Voice traffic can enter the home either as wired e.g. Cat 3 or wireless e.g. cell phones and can be distributed within the home using Cat 3 wiring. Entertainment media or other graphical data can enter the home either through satellite or cable and is typically distributed in the home using coaxial cable. IEEE 1394 and DVI are also digital interconnects for clusters of media devices. All of these network environments and others that can emerge or already have emerged as protocol standards can be interconnected to form a network such as an intranet that can be connected to the outside world by way of a wide area network such as the Internet. In short a variety of disparate sources exist for the storage and transmission of data and consequently any of the computing devices of the present innovation can share and communicate data in any existing manner and no one way described in the embodiments herein is intended to be limiting.

The Internet commonly refers to the collection of networks and gateways that utilize the Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP suite of protocols which are well known in the art of computer networking. The Internet can be described as a system of geographically distributed remote computer networks interconnected by computers executing networking protocols that allow users to interact and share information over network s . Because of such wide spread information sharing remote networks such as the Internet have thus far generally evolved into an open system with which developers can design software applications for performing specialized operations or services essentially without restriction.

Thus the network infrastructure enables a host of network topologies such as client server peer to peer or hybrid architectures. The client is a member of a class or group that uses the services of another class or group to which it is not related. Thus in computing a client is a process i.e. roughly a set of instructions or tasks that requests a service provided by another program. The client process utilizes the requested service without having to know any working details about the other program or the service itself. In a client server architecture particularly a networked system a client is usually a computer that accesses shared network resources provided by another computer e.g. a server. In the illustration of as an example computers etc. can be thought of as clients and computers etc. can be thought of as servers where servers etc. maintain the data that is then replicated to client computers etc. although any computer can be considered a client a server or both depending on the circumstances. Any of these computing devices can be processing data or requesting services or tasks that can implicate the optimization algorithms and processes in accordance with at least one generalized non limiting embodiment.

A server is typically a remote computer system accessible over a remote or local network such as the Internet or wireless network infrastructures. The client process can be active in a first computer system and the server process can be active in a second computer system communicating with one another over a communications medium thus providing distributed functionality and allowing multiple clients to take advantage of the information gathering capabilities of the server. Any software objects utilized pursuant to the optimization algorithms and processes of at least one generalized non limiting embodiment can be distributed across multiple computing devices or objects.

Client s and server s communicate with one another utilizing the functionality provided by protocol layer s . For example HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP is a common protocol that is used in conjunction with the World Wide Web WWW or the Web. Typically a computer network address such as an Internet Protocol IP address or other reference such as a Universal Resource Locator URL can be used to identify the server or client computers to each other. The network address can be referred to as a URL address. Communication can be provided over a communications medium e.g. client s and server s can be coupled to one another via TCP IP connection s for high capacity communication.

Thus illustrates an exemplary networked or distributed environment with server s in communication with client computer s via a network bus in which the present innovation can be employed. In more detail a number of servers etc. are interconnected via a communications network bus which can be a LAN WAN intranet GSM network the Internet etc. with a number of client or remote computing devices etc. such as a portable computer handheld computer thin client networked appliance or other device such as a VCR TV oven light heater and the like in accordance with the present innovation. It is thus contemplated that the present innovation can apply to any computing device in connection with which it is desirable to communicate data over a network.

In a network environment in which the communications network bus is the Internet for example the servers etc. can be Web servers with which the clients etc. communicate via any of a number of known protocols such as HTTP. Servers etc. can also serve as clients etc. as can be characteristic of a distributed computing environment.

As mentioned communications can be wired or wireless or a combination where appropriate. Client devices etc. can or cannot communicate via communications network bus and can have independent communications associated therewith. For example in the case of a TV or VCR there can or cannot be a networked aspect to the control thereof. Each client computer etc. and server computer etc. can be equipped with various application program modules or objects etc. and with connections or access to various types of storage elements or objects across which files or data streams can be stored or to which portion s of files or data streams can be downloaded transmitted or migrated. Any one or more of computers etc. can be responsible for the maintenance and updating of a database or other storage element such as a database or memory for storing data processed or saved according to at least one generalized non limiting embodiment. Thus the present innovation can be utilized in a computer network environment having client computers etc. that can access and interact with a computer network bus and server computers etc. that can interact with client computers etc. and other like devices and databases .

As mentioned the innovation applies to any device wherein it can be desirable to communicate data e.g. to a mobile device. It should be understood therefore that handheld portable and other computing devices and computing objects of all kinds are contemplated for use in connection with the present innovation i.e. anywhere that a device can communicate data or otherwise receive process or store data. Accordingly the below general purpose remote computer described below in is but one example and the present innovation can be implemented with any client having network bus interoperability and interaction. Thus the present innovation can be implemented in an environment of networked hosted services in which very little or minimal client resources are implicated e.g. a networked environment in which the client device serves merely as an interface to the network bus such as an object placed in an appliance.

Although not required at least one generalized non limiting embodiment can partly be implemented via an operating system for use by a developer of services for a device or object and or included within application software that operates in connection with the component s of at least one generalized non limiting embodiment. Software can be described in the general context of computer executable instructions such as program modules being executed by one or more computers such as client workstations servers or other devices. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the innovation can be practiced with other computer system configurations and protocols.
