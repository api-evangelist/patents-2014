This application is a continuation of and claims benefit of priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 376 764 filed Feb. 28 2003. The contents of that application are hereby incorporated by reference herein.

This invention relates to the field of document management and in particular to a method and system for initiating and managing server based collaboration.

Computer systems allow users to create view and modify documents using various applications. A document is a collection of data in one or more files. For example data in a document may represent text graphic spreadsheet audio video meta data about the document or any combination of two or more of these.

Often there is a need for multiple users to collaborate on a single document. This can be done by sending the document as an attachment to an email message. A first collaborator with the document initiates collaboration by attaching a copy of the document to an email message and sending the message to the other collaborators. The collaborators can then view and modify the document. A problem with this form of collaboration is coordinating the changes made by the various collaborators. For example if A B and C are collaborators collaborating on a document which has been sent via email to B and C by A then each of A B and C will have a copy of the document. Each collaborator s copy of the document is separately edited by that collaborator. Collaborators may make conflicting changes in the document. Email may be exchanged between the collaborators including comments on the collaboration. Email may also be used to send different versions of the document. At some point changes made by the collaborators in their separate copies will need to be examined and conflicts reconciled to produce a single document which contains the results of the collaboration.

The need to resolve conflicts may be avoided using a common server for document collaboration. Collaborators have access for example via a network to a document residing on a server. Using such a collaboration server can prevent conflicts for example by allowing only one collaborator at a time to edit the document. However setting up a collaboration server can be difficult. A user must at a minimum identify a server set access rights for collaborators and upload the document to the server. Managing the collaboration server is also difficult. For example it is difficult but desirable to allow new users access to the document or to modify or remove access rights of existing collaborators. Additionally it is difficult to encourage users to use the collaboration server when editing rather than editing their individual copy.

Collaborators viewing and modifying a document on a collaboration server may be able to view in document comments from fellow collaborators. For example Microsoft s WORD word processing software allows users to include comment data in documents which may be displayed in the margins of a document or in a separate pane. However the exchange of comments other than those included in the document among collaborators is not supported by the collaboration server.

The invention provides methods and systems to initiate and manage server based collaboration. The invention allows a user to initiate and manage collaboration on a collaboration server using email to co collaborators. In this way the advantages of collaboration using email with attachments are combined with the conflict prevention advantages of collaboration using a collaboration server.

Server based collaboration is initiated by an email. When the user creates the email message with attachments a collaboration website is provisioned. The collaboration website allows collaborations on the attached documents by the recipients of the message. The ease of collaboration with email and the advantages of the collaboration server are thus both available to the user.

Although not required the invention can be implemented via an operating system for use by a developer of services for a device or object and or included within application software that operates according to the invention. Software may be described in the general context of computer executable instructions such as program modules being executed by one or more computers such as client workstations servers or other devices.

Various distributed computing frameworks have been and are being developed in light of the convergence of personal computing and the Internet. Individuals and business users alike are provided with a seamlessly interoperable and Web enabled interface for applications and computing devices making computing activities increasingly Web browser or network oriented.

For example MICROSOFT s .NET platform includes servers building block services such as Web based data storage and downloadable device software. While exemplary embodiments herein are described in connection with software residing on a computing device one or more portions of the invention may also be implemented via an operating system application programming interface API or a middle man object between any of a coprocessor a display device and requesting object such that operation according to the invention may be performed by supported in or accessed via all of .NET s languages and services and in other distributed computing frameworks as well.

As shown in according to one embodiment of the invention in order to begin a collaboration an initiating collaborator using first computer and electronic messaging software creates an electronic message. Electronic messaging software may be for example an e mail client application modified for use in this invention. The electronic message created by the user includes a distribution list of one or more recipient addresses. These recipient addresses are the addresses for the other collaborator s . The initiating collaborator includes the document or documents to be collaborated upon as one or more attachments to the electronic message. A document can be any type of computer data file with any file format useable with any application.

In one embodiment the electronic messaging software provides a dialogue box requesting that the user select a collaboration server to use from a number of possible collaboration servers. The possible collaboration servers displayed are limited to those through which the initiating collaborator can provision a web site and using information from the one or more recipient addresses those which the other collaborator s can access. The collaboration server selected by the user from this list will be collaboration server through which collaboration will be accomplished.

If only one collaboration server is available to the initial collaborator in one embodiment a list containing only the identity of one collaboration server is displayed for the user. In another embodiment that collaboration server is selected without displaying the dialogue box. In one embodiment the dialogue box also includes an area for the user to input a collaboration server to select or allows the user to browse for possible collaboration servers. The collaboration server list in one embodiment includes the most recently used collaboration server s or the most recently visited collaboration server s .

In other embodiments no dialogue box is presented by the electronic messaging software and the collaboration server used is a pre selected server. In other embodiments the list of possible collaboration servers does not take into account the recipient addresses.

In addition to the attached document and the distribution list optionally the user may include other information in the electronic message. For example the user may describe the attached message the collaboration purpose or include any other information accepted by the electronic messaging software .

Once the initiating collaborator indicates to electronic messaging software that the electronic message is ready to be sent a collaboration web site is provisioned using the collaboration server that the initiating collaborator has selected or the one that has been pre specified or that is the only collaboration server available in other embodiments . In one embodiment this is done by means of communications over a network .

Once the collaboration web site has been provisioned the recipients listed in the distribution list are added to the access control list ACL for the collaboration server to give them access to collaboration web site. In one embodiment the addresses in the distribution list are verified or converted into a different credential to be added to the ACL for the collaboration server. This is dependent on the collaboration server used. In one embodiment the addresses in the distribution list are added using HTTP SOAP .HTTP Hypertext Transfer Protocol is a protocol for communicating across a network. SOAP Simple Object Access Protocol is a protocol which may be used in combination with HTTP which provides a framework for describing what is included in a message a set of encoding rules for expressing data and a convention for representing remote procedure calls and responses. An HTTP SOAP request may be used to ask the collaboration server to create the collaboration web site and to add the addresses in the distribution list to the ACL.

The attachment or attachments to the electronic message are added to the document collection of collaboration server . Where collaboration server includes discussion capability to allow a collaborator participate in a discussion by sending messages in one embodiment the body of the electronic message is added to discussion collection of collaboration server . In alternate embodiments a task list or calendar is maintained on collaboration server for use by the collaborators in the collaboration. The recipients listed in the ACL are given access to these documents in document collection and related discussion messages in discussion collection if any of collaboration server via the collaboration web site. These users can access the collaboration web site through other collaborator computers which are connected to the collaboration web site for example via the Internet or other computer network.

In addition to configuring and populating the collaboration server the electronic messaging software sends the electronic message to an electronic message server for delivery. The electronic message is in one embodiment altered to include a hyperlink to the collaboration web site and optionally explanatory text.

As shown in the method of the invention begins with step in which a message including recipient information and one or more attached documents is accepted. In step a request is sent to a collaboration server to initiate collaboration among the recipients on the one or more attached documents. In step the message is sent to the recipients.

The electronic message used may be any of a variety of electronic messages. For example an email message meeting request or other electronic message may be used to initiate sharing.

In one embodiment the permissions for the collaboration server may also be set by using this electronic messaging. For example users listed in the To header of the email may receive read and write privileges for the attached documents at the collaboration site while users listed in the Cc carbon copy header may only have read privileges. A user listed in a Bcc blind carbon copy header may receive no privileges. In one embodiment each user s privilege level may be adjusted by the initiating collaborator through a tool tip or other selection means.

The electronic messaging software serves as a collaboration entry point. According to one embodiment from this collaboration entry point the user has two options. First the user can send an electronic message with attachments without creating a collaboration site. Second the user can request that a collaboration be initiated. This causes the creation of a new collaboration site with the attachments copied to that site. Additionally email is sent to the collaborators. Attached to the email are the attachments that have been entered on the collaboration site.

For some attachments an application used to open or otherwise use the attachment may be known to have enhanced linking functionality that enables the application to identify that the attachment is a collaboration document. For such attachments qualifying attachments a link may be inserted. When the attachment is opened by the application the link indicates that the document is the subject of a collaboration so that updates on the local machine may be entered to the collaboration site and so that when the document is opened for reading or editing on the local machine the version on the collaboration site is checked to determine whether a more recent version exists.

For example if a first user is preparing a presentation document using presentation software and would like to collaborate with a second and a third user the first user creates an email message addressed to the second and third user. In it the first user writes a message requesting help with the document. The first user attaches the document to the email as an attachment. A user interface pane allows the first user to select collaboration and a collaboration server. The first user then sends the email. A collaboration site is provisioned information regarding the collaboration server is inserted into the email message and a link is inserted into the email attachments that allows the presentation software used by the second and third users. If for example the second user edits the presentation document the version on the collaboration site is updated. Then when the third user opens the presentation document the presentation software checks the version on the collaboration site determines that there is a new version on the server and opens that version for the third user to edit. The first user can then see the second and third users edits at one time without needing to view and synchronize edits from two different documents. Discussion regarding the document can also occur on the collaboration site.

In order to add a collaborator the electronic message is forwarded to another recipient. In one embodiment only the initiating collaborator may add a collaborator in this way. In another embodiment the initiating collaborator may assign the rights to add additional collaborators to any or all of the other collaborators. In one embodiment forwarding a shared document adds new collaborators to the current collaboration site. This does not spawn a second shared copy in a new collaboration site. In this embodiment sharing the same document with two different groups would require the initiating collaborator to possess two copies of the document In another embodiment a second collaboration is initiated when a shared document is forwarded and in another embodiment the user forwarding a shared document in an email is given a choice whether to initiate a new collaboration or invite new collaborators to an existing collaboration.

As mentioned above while exemplary embodiments of the present invention have been described in connection with various computing devices and network architectures the underlying concepts may be applied to any computing device or system in which it is desirable to implement initiation of server based collaboration. Thus the methods and systems of the present invention may be applied to a variety of applications and devices. While exemplary programming languages names and examples are chosen herein as representative of various choices these languages names and examples are not intended to be limiting. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that there are numerous ways of providing object code that achieves the same similar or equivalent systems and methods achieved by the invention.

The various techniques described herein may be implemented in connection with hardware or software or where appropriate with a combination of both. Thus the methods and apparatus of the present invention or certain aspects or portions thereof may take the form of program code i.e. instructions embodied in tangible media such as floppy diskettes CD ROMs hard drives or any other machine readable storage medium wherein when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine such as a computer the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the invention. In the case of program code execution on programmable computers the computing device will generally include a processor a storage medium readable by the processor including volatile and non volatile memory and or storage elements at least one input device and at least one output device. One or more programs that may utilize the signal processing services of the present invention e.g. through the use of a data processing API or the like are preferably implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented programming language to communicate with a computer. However the program s can be implemented in assembly or machine language if desired. In any case the language may be a compiled or interpreted language and combined with hardware implementations.

The methods and apparatus of the present invention may also be practiced via communications embodied in the form of program code that is transmitted over some transmission medium such as over electrical wiring or cabling through fiber optics or via any other form of transmission wherein when the program code is received and loaded into and executed by a machine such as an EPROM a gate array a programmable logic device PLD a client computer a video recorder or the like or a receiving machine having the signal processing capabilities as described in exemplary embodiments above becomes an apparatus for practicing the invention. When implemented on a general purpose processor the program code combines with the processor to provide a unique apparatus that operates to invoke the functionality of the present invention. Additionally any storage techniques used in connection with the present invention may invariably be a combination of hardware and software.

While the present invention has been described in connection with the preferred embodiments of the various figures it is to be understood that other similar embodiments may be used or modifications and additions may be made to the described embodiment for performing the same function of the present invention without deviating therefrom. Furthermore it should be emphasized that a variety of computer platforms including handheld device operating systems and other application specific operating systems are contemplated especially as the number of wireless networked devices continues to proliferate. Therefore the present invention should not be limited to any single embodiment but rather should be construed in breadth and scope in accordance with the appended claims.
