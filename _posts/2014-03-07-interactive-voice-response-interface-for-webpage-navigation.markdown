The present application generally relates to an interactive voice response interface for webpage navigation and more specifically to providing interactive voice response functionality to existing webpages so a user may navigate the webpage and complete webpage forms using the interactive voice response functions.

Websites utilize webpage forms that provide for data entry from users that may be retained and or utilized by the website. In general presentation logic controls the presentation of fields and content to a user and is linked to business logic controlling how the data is displayed changed stored and utilized. Thus when a user interacts with overlying presentation logic on a webpage the backend business logic processes the interactions and may store or utilize the resulting data for the website databases etc. Websites may be hosted by a single or set of networked servers that enable users to access and manipulate the website.

Interactive voice response IVR provides a technology allowing a user to interact with such as receive and transmit data between computer systems including networked servers. A server may also host the website which may also be offered to the user as a data entry point. However IVR systems are constructed separate from general presentation logic of webpage elements. For example a separate system is constructed and tied to the backend business logic in an IVR system. The separate system governs the presentation of IVR messages and the receipt of keyboard and or voice input. Thus existing webpage content created for use and display to the user is not reused for the IVR system and vice versa. Therefore existing servers require construction of two separate systems in order to offer website and IVR functionality to users.

Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.

A networked server may include a website having individual webpages including webpage elements that may accept entries changes and other inputs from a user to store and or process data from the inputs. The webpage may further offer an Interactive Voice Response IVR system interface for the webpage. The IVR interface may include a flow of webpage elements on the webpage which are verbally and or textually presented to the user. The IVR system may further accept inputs that correspond to the webpage elements so that the user may make selections and or enter input on the webpage. The IVR system may accept vocal and or textual inputs e.g. a button or key selection or a voice command for each webpage element. Thus the user may enter information into the webpage using the IVR system.

The IVR interface may be constructed by defining custom HTML or other webpage tags for fields and or elements on the webpage. Thus the custom HTML tags may correspond to a flow of information in the IVR system interface and include sequencing numbers corresponding to the flow. In other embodiments a separate file and or database may maintain the IVR flow information with links the existing fields and or elements on the webpage. Once the IVR flow information is defined a JavaScript library may be constructed where the JavaScript library interprets the IVR flow information. The JavaScript library may be included with the webpage so that the library is downloaded to the user s browser when the user accesses the webpage. Thus the user may initiate the JavaScript library when the user visits the webpage and utilize the IVR interface. Where custom HTML tags are utilized the software component library may process the underlying HTML document for the webpage. In other embodiments using a separate file or database the software component library may process the file database that includes links to the webpage and processes to interact with the webpage through user inputs.

System includes a user a user device an IVR server and a website server in communication directly and or over a network . IVR server may establish an IVR flow for the webpage and define IVR flow information using either custom HTML tags on fields in the webpage or through a separate file database which maintains IVR flow information as links to the fields in the webpage. Once IVR flow information is determined a software component library may be generated that interprets the IVR flow information and loads voice messages corresponding to the fields from the IVR flow information. User may utilize user device to access a webpage of website server and received the software component library. Thus user may hear the voice messages and input data information to the webpage through the messages when user initiates the software component library. Thus user may navigate webpages of website server using the IVR interface provided by IVR server .

In various embodiments network interface component may include a DSL e.g. Digital Subscriber Line modem a PSTN Public Switched Telephone Network modem an Ethernet device a broadband device a satellite device and or various other types of wired and or wireless network communication devices including microwave radio frequency infrared Bluetooth and near field communication devices.

IVR server may be maintained for example by a server offering IVR services for navigation of a website including webpages and webpage forms. Generally IVR server may be maintained by anyone or any entity that provides the IVR services described below. In this regard IVR server may include one or more processing applications which may be configured to interact with user device and or website server to generate IVR interfaces for webpages hosted by website server and transmit them to user device and or website server for presentation when user visits the webpage using user device . Although IVR server is shown separate from website server some or all of the features and processes of IVR server may be incorporated within website server .

IVR server includes a webpage IVR application other applications a database and a network interface component . Webpage IVR application and other applications may correspond to processes procedures and or applications executable by a hardware processor for example a software program. In other embodiments IVR server may include additional or different software as required

Webpage IVR application may be configured to generate and provide interactive voice response IVR like interfaces for existing websites and webpages that do not originally provide an IVR interface. In this regard webpage IVR application may process a website and the websites corresponding webpages to provide an IVR like interface. An IVR interface for a website may provide for voice messages and or commands that user can hear. The voice messages and or commands may correspond to webpage elements and may provide for a vocal layout of the webpage for example announcing the selectable tabs of a webpage the available fields to enter information for a webpage and or the navigational tools of the webpage or the overarching website. In a typical webpage with forms that can be filled out presentation logic sits on top of the fields and content. The presentation logic is connected to backend business logic that determines how data can be entered stored and or manipulated changed transmitted etc. . Thus in order to reuse existing webpage presentation logic without building a new IVR system tied to the backend business logic webpage IVR application may determine a webpage s IVR flow of existing webpage elements in a webpage and or webpage form and define specify IVR flow information on top of the existing webpage elements.

In order to determine the IVR flow information existing webpage elements may be selected and an IVR flow between the existing webpage elements determined. For example an IVR flow may correspond to assigning a first webpage element as first in the IVR flow and assigning that first webpage element a first message including in various embodiments a keyboard command to select change and or execute that webpage element . Similarly the next webpage element receives a similar treatment. Once an IVR flow is determined IVR flow information may be specified using custom HTML tags corresponding to the webpage elements. The custom HTML tags may define the IVR flow info Illation within the webpage itself. The custom HTML tags may be included in the underlying webpage code and be interpretable by a software component library such as a JavaScript library. In other embodiments different scripting languages may be utilized. Thus the software component library may be written in any browser scripting language. The custom HTML tags may include sequencing information e.g. from the first webpage element to the next as well as voice messages to play for each webpage element. The custom HTML tags may also include information for keys and or keyboard commands corresponding to each webpage element so that user may access select and or provide information to the webpage element.

In other embodiments the IVR flow information may be specified using a separate file database which maintains the IVR flow information and includes links to the existing fields in the webpage. For example a JavaScript Object Notation JSON file may include IVR flow information by including links to the existing webpage elements as well as voice messages to play for the webpage elements or text to convert to voice messages and the sequencing of the webpage elements. However as previously discussed other file formats may be utilized for the browser s scripting language. Thus the file database may be formatted in a format matching the browser scripting language utilized to generate the software component library. The file may provide for mapping between keys of a keyboard and or keyboard commands and the webpage elements to enable a user to access select and or provide information to the webpage element.

A software component library such as a JavaScript library may be created to interpret the custom HTML tags and or separate file database. The JavaScript library may be transmitted to a user s browser such as browser application of user device . On execution of a particular keyboard command e.g. ctrl I etc. the software component library may be loaded to interpret the IVR flow information in either the custom HTML tags or separate file database. Thus once user engages the software component library the software component library may be utilized to present an IVR interface to user by interpreting the custom HTML tags and playing their corresponding voice messages or processing the separate file database and playing voice messages corresponding to the linked webpage elements.

In various embodiments IVR server includes other applications as may be desired in particular embodiments to provide features to IVR server . For example other applications may include security applications for implementing server side security features programmatic server applications for interfacing with appropriate application programming interfaces APIs over network or other types of applications. Other applications may contain software programs executable by a processor including a graphical user interface GUI configured to provide an interface to a user.

IVR server may further include database which may include for example identifiers such as operating system registry entries cookies associated with webpage IVR application and or other applications identifiers associated with hardware of IVR server or other appropriate identifiers such as identifiers used for device authentication or identification. Database may include IVR flow information for webpages of website server as well as matching software component libraries. IVR flow information and or software component libraries may be stored in database for retrieval by user device or may be transmitted to website server for use with webpages hosted by website server .

In various embodiments IVR server includes at least one network interface component adapted to communicate with user device and or website server . In various embodiments network interface component may include a DSL e.g. Digital Subscriber Line modem a PSTN Public Switched Telephone Network modem an Ethernet device a broadband device a satellite device and or various other types of wired and or wireless network communication devices including microwave radio frequency infrared Bluetooth and near field communication devices.

In this regard website server includes one or more website hosting applications which may be configured to interact with user device and or IVR server to provide a website and corresponding webpages to user with IVR like interfaces for navigation and use of the webpages. In one example website server may be provided by PAYPAL Inc. of San Jose Calif. USA. However in other embodiments website server may be maintained by any website. Although website server is shown separate from website server some or all of the features and processes of website server may be incorporated within IVR server .

Website server of includes a website hosting application other applications a database and a network interface component . Website hosting application and other application may correspond to processes procedures and or applications executable by a hardware processor for example a software program. In other embodiments website server may include additional or different software as required.

Website hosting application may be configured to provide for hosting a website including presentation of underlying webpages of the website. Website hosting application may provide for webpages that are displayable to user through user device . In this regard user may utilize user device to access one or more websites of website server and view the webpages of the associated domain. The webpages may correspond to Hypertext Markup Language HTML or similar XHTML and or CSS documents that may be accessed and transmitted using Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP by user device .

In addition to providing the webpages website hosting application may provide IVR like interfaces using IVR flow information and a software component library provided by IVR server . When IVR information flow corresponds to custom HTML tags website hosting application may insert the custom HTML tags into a webpages HTML document. Thus when the webpage is accessed a software component library e.g. JavaScript or other browser scripting language library may be downloaded to user device and engaged through a keyboard command by user . The software component library may then interpret the custom HTML tags in the webpages HTML document. However where the IVR flow information is defined using a separate file database the separate file database may be downloaded to user device when accessing a webpage and include tags to webpage elements fields in the file database. A similar software component library may also be downloaded and engaged using a keyboard command. Once the file database is interpreted by the software component library the file database may include keyboard keys and or commands shortcuts to engage webpage elements fields.

In various embodiments website server includes other applications as may be desired in particular embodiments to provide features to website server . For example other applications may include security applications for implementing server side security features programmatic server applications for interfacing with appropriate application programming interfaces APIs over network or other types of applications. Other applications may contain software programs executable by a processor including a graphical user interface GUI configured to provide an interface to a user.

Additionally website server includes database which may include website data logic and content. Database may include user accounts usable with the website of website server . User accounts may include user information such as name address birthdate payment funding information additional user financial information and or other desired user data. User may link a user account in database through a user identifier user device identifier and or user account identifier. Thus when an appropriate identifier is transmitted to website server e.g. from user device and or IVR server a user account belonging to user may be found. However in other embodiments user may not have previously established a user account. Thus website server may complete transactions and procedures based on other user information received from user device and or IVR server . Database may include IVR interface information such as IVR flow information and or corresponding software component libraries for interpreting and presenting the IVR flow information. Information in database may be utilized to present an IVR like interface for webpages of website server .

In various embodiments website server includes at least one network interface component adapted to communicate with network including user device and or IVR server . In various embodiments network interface component may comprise a DSL e.g. Digital Subscriber Line modem a PSTN Public Switched Telephone Network modem an Ethernet device a broadband device a satellite device and or various other types of wired and or wireless network communication devices including microwave radio frequency RF and infrared IR communication devices.

Network may be implemented as a single network or a combination of multiple networks. For example in various embodiments network may include the Internet or one or more intranets landline networks wireless networks and or other appropriate types of networks. Thus network may correspond to small scale communication networks such as a private or local area network or a larger scale network such as a wide area network or the Internet accessible by the various components of system .

User device displays browser application interface having webpage for website X . Webpage may include a webpage form having transfer amount and a continue button . Additionally webpage includes a selected element . As previously discussed an IVR like interface for webpage may be engaged using a keyboard command or may be engaged using another input such as a voice input mouse input etc. Once the IVR like interface is engaged through a user initiation IVR flow information for webpage may be interpreted by a software component library.

For example the IVR flow information may correspond to custom HTML tags in the HTML document for webpage . Thus a software component library such as a JavaScript library may interpret the custom HTML tags in the webpage document that correspond to webpage elements and their corresponding voice messages. A custom HTML tag may be assigned a keyboard or voice input shortcut for selection of the webpage element. Thus webpage form may include a first custom HTML tag that is interpreted and a voice message is loaded and played that states the name of webpage form such as Transfer Money Form. Transfer amount may be a second custom HTML tags that plays a second message shown in an IVR message as Enter or state an amount of money to transfer and press return or say complete. As shown in the custom HTML tag for transfer amount may include a keyboard or voice command that enables the user viewing browser application interface to complete the webpage element of transfer amount . In addition IVR message or another IVR message may also state Press ctrl 2 to begin entering a transfer amount in order to navigate to transfer amount where the webpage element for transfer amount is not immediately selected when IVR message is played. Thus IVR message may include information for the user to arrive at transfer amount as selected element . In other embodiments IVR message includes a voice command that may allow navigation through website X such as a press backspace to return to the previous form webpage. Webpage may further include a third webpage element continue button which may be selectable with a voice command or keyboard command. Thus IVR message instructs the user to say complete or press return to complete the field of transfer amount and change selected element to continue button as is shown in .

Similar to custom HTML tags a separate file document such as a JSON or other file format document corresponding to the browser scripting language that includes the IVR flow information between webpage elements may be utilized. In a document webpage form may be tagged with links and include a message and a keyboard voice command that may select a webpage element and or enter information into the webpage element. In a similar manner when the software component library loads the file database and plays voice messages in the file database those webpage elements may be selected changed and or processed. The voice messages and walkthrough of webpage may be similar to as described above. The voice messages may include audio files or may include text messages that are translated and played. Thus in such a way a user may be walked through webpage through voice commands.

If selection of continue button causes website X to advance to a new webpage the new webpage may similarly contain IVR flow information in the form of HTML tags or a separate file database that is interpreted by a software component library. Thus user device may continue executing the software component library which then interprets the IVR flow information for the new webpage. The IVR flow information for the new webpage may then navigate the user through the webpage by similarly issuing voice instructions to select webpage elements and enter information into those webpage elements.

At step IVR flow information from each of at least one webpage element in a webpage is determined. IVR flow information may comprise custom HTML tags corresponding to the each of the at least one webpage element. In other embodiments IVR flow information may comprise a separate file or database with links to the each of the at least one webpage element. In various embodiments the separate file may be a JSON file or other file format for use with a browser scripting language.

A software component library is transmitted to a user for processing on a user initiation to present an IVR interface to the user using the IVR flow information wherein the user utilizes the IVR interface to enter at least one input corresponding to the at least one webpage element at step . The software component library may interpret the IVR flow information of the webpage in order to present the each of the at least one webpage element using the IVR flow information. The IVR interface may walk the user through the webpage elements in an order and provide for keyboard and or voice command to select webpage elements enter information to those webpage elements and navigate throughout the webpage including to other webpages. The software component library may comprise a JavaScript library and may be transmitted to a web browser of the user. In other embodiments the JavaScript library may be another browser scripting language. Additionally user initiation of the software library may comprise navigating to the webpage a user keyboard command and or a user voice command.

At step the at least one input is received from the user. The at least one input may comprise a text input and or a voice input. Additionally the at least one input may be entered into a corresponding webpage element of the at least one webpage element. The webpage may be submitted to a host of the webpage after entering the at least one input into the corresponding webpage element.
