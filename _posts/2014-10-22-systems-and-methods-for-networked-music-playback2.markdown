The process is to identify multimedia content from the multimedia content source pass information regarding the multimedia content to device on the local playback network in response to a trigger and facilitate play of the multimedia content via the devices on the local playback network.

Referring now to the drawings in which like numerals can refer to like parts throughout the figures shows an example system configuration in which one or more of the method and or apparatus disclosed herein can be practiced or implemented. By way of illustration the system configuration represents a home with multiple zones. Each zone for example represents a different room or space such as an office bathroom bedroom kitchen dining room family room home theater room utility or laundry room and patio. While not shown here a single zone can cover more than one room or space. One or more of zone players are shown in each respective zone. A zone player also referred to as a playback device multimedia unit speaker and so on provides audio video and or audiovisual output. A controller e.g. shown in the kitchen for purposes of illustration provides control to the system configuration . The system configuration illustrates an example whole house audio system though it is understood that the technology described herein is not limited to its particular place of application or to an expansive system like a whole house audio system of .

The example zone player of includes a built in amplifier not shown in this illustration to power a set of detached speakers . The speakers of can include for example any type of loudspeaker. The zone player of can communicate a signal corresponding to audio content to the detached speakers via wired and or wireless channels. Instead of receiving and generating audio content as in the zone player of receives the audio content and transmits the same e.g. after processing the received signal to the detached speakers . Similar to the example zone player of in some embodiments the zone player can transmit a second signal to for example other zone player s in the same or different zone s speaker s receiver s and so on.

The example zone player of does not include an amplifier but allows a receiver or another audio and or video type device with built in amplification to connect to a data network of and to play audio received over the data network via the receiver and a set of detached speakers . In addition to the wired couplings shown in the detached speakers can receive audio content via a wireless communication channel between the detached speakers and for example the zone player and or the receiver . In some embodiments the zone player can transmit a second signal to for example other zone player s in the same or different zone s speaker s receiver s and so on.

Example zone players include a Sonos S5 Sonos Play 5 Sonos Play 3 ZonePlayer 120 and ZonePlayer 90 which are offered by Sonos Inc. of Santa Barbara Calif. Any other past present and or future zone players can additionally or alternatively be used to implement the zone players of example embodiments disclosed herein. A zone player can also be referred to herein as a playback device and a zone player is not limited to the particular examples illustrated in . For example a zone player can include a wired or wireless headphone. In other examples a zone player might include a subwoofer. In yet other examples a zone player can include a sound bar. In an example a zone player can include or interact with a docking station for an Apple iPod or similar device. In some embodiments a zone player can relay one or more signals received from for example a first zone player to another playback device. In some embodiments a zone player can receive a first signal and generate an output corresponding to the first signal and simultaneously or separately can receive a second signal and transmit or relay the second signal to another zone player s speaker s receiver s and so on. Thus an example zone player described herein can act as a playback device and at the same time operate as a hub in a network of zone players. In such instances media content corresponding to the first signal can be different from the media content corresponding to the second signal.

Referring back to the system configuration of a particular zone can contain one or more zone players. For example the family room of contains two zone players and while the kitchen is shown with one zone player . Zones can be dynamically configured by positioning a zone player in a room or space and assigning via the controller the zone player to a new or existing zone. As such zones can be created combined with another zone removed and given a specific name e.g. Kitchen if so programmed. The zone players to are coupled directly or indirectly to a data network such as the data network shown in . The data network is represented by an octagon in the figure to stand out from other components shown in the figure. While the data network is shown in a single location it is understood that such a network can be distributed in and around the system configuration .

Particularly the data network can be a wired network a wireless network or a combination of both. In some embodiments one or more of the zone players are wirelessly coupled to the data network based on a proprietary mesh network. In some embodiments one or more of the zone players are wirelessly coupled to the data network using a non mesh topology. In some embodiments one or more of the zone players are coupled via a wire to the data network using Ethernet or similar technology. In addition to the one or more zone players connecting to the data network the data network can further allow access to a wide area network such as the Internet.

In certain embodiments the data network can be created by connecting any of the zone players or some other connecting device to a broadband router. Other zone players can then be added wired or wirelessly to the data network . For example a zone player e.g. any of zone players can be added to the system configuration by simply pressing a button on the zone player itself which enables a connection to be made to the data network . The broadband router can be connected to an Internet Service Provider ISP for example. The broadband router can be used to form another data network within the system configuration which can be used in other applications e.g. web surfing . The data network can also be used in other applications if so programmed. Further in certain embodiments the data network is the same network used for other applications in the household.

In certain embodiments each zone can play from the same audio source as another zone or each zone can play from a different audio source. For example someone can be grilling on the patio and listening to jazz music via zone player while someone is preparing food in the kitchen and listening to classical music via zone player . Further someone can be in the office listening to the same jazz music via zone player that is playing on the patio via zone player . In some embodiments the jazz music played via zone players and is played in synchrony. Synchronizing playback amongst zones allows for someone to pass through zones while seamlessly listening to the audio. Further zones can be put into a party mode such that all associated zones will play audio in synchrony.

In certain embodiments a zone contains two or more zone players. For example the family room contains two zone players and and the home theater room contains at least zone players and . A zone can be configured to contain as many zone players as desired and for example the home theater room might contain additional zone players to play audio from a 5.1 channel or greater audio source e.g. a movie encoded with 5.1 or greater audio channels . If a zone contains two or more zone players such as the two zone players and in the family room then the two zone players and can be configured to play the same audio source in synchrony or the two zone players and can be paired to play two separate sounds in left and right channels for example. In other words the stereo effects of a sound can be reproduced or enhanced through the two zone players and one for the left sound and the other for the right sound. In certain embodiments paired zone players can play audio in synchrony with other zone players.

In certain embodiments three or more zone players can be configured to play various channels of audio that is encoded with three channels or more sound. For example the home theater room shows zone players and . If the sound is encoded as 2.1 channel audio then the zone player can be configured to play left channel audio the zone player can be configured to play right channel audio and the zone player can be configured to play bass frequencies. Other configurations are possible and depend on the number of zone players and the type of audio. Further a particular zone can be configured to play a 5.1 channel audio in one instance such as when playing audio from a movie and then dynamically switch to play stereo such as when playing audio from a two channel source.

In certain embodiments two or more zone players can be sonically consolidated to form a single consolidated zone player. A consolidated zone player though made up of multiple separate devices can be configured to process and reproduce sound differently than an unconsolidated zone player or zone players that are paired because a consolidated zone player will have additional speaker drivers from which sound can be passed. The consolidated zone player can further be paired with a single zone player or yet another consolidated zone player. Each playback device of a consolidated playback device is preferably set in a consolidated mode.

According to some embodiments one can continue to do any of group consolidate and pair zone players for example until a desired configuration is complete. The actions of grouping consolidation and pairing are preferably performed through a control interface such as using controller and not by physically connecting and re connecting speaker wire for example to individual discrete speakers to create different configurations. As such certain embodiments described herein provide a more flexible and dynamic platform through which sound reproduction can be offered to the end user.

Sources of audio content to be played by zone players are numerous. Music from a personal library stored on a computer or networked attached storage NAS can be accessed via the data network and played. Internet radio stations shows and podcasts can be accessed via the data network . Music services that let a user stream and download music and audio content can be accessed via the data network . Further music can be obtained from traditional sources such as a turntable or CD player via a line in connection to a zone player for example. Audio content can also be accessed through AirPlay wireless technology by Apple Inc. for example. Audio content received from one or more sources can be shared amongst the zone players to via the data network and or the controller . The above disclosed sources of audio content are referred to herein as network based audio information sources. However network based audio information sources are not limited thereto.

The example home theater zone players are coupled to an audio information source such as a television . In some examples the television is used as a source of audio for the home theater zone players while in other examples audio information from the television can be shared with any of the zone players in the audio system .

Referring now to there is shown an example functional block diagram of a zone player in accordance with an embodiment. The zone player of includes a network interface a processor a memory an audio processing component a module an audio amplifier and a speaker unit coupled to the audio amplifier . shows an example illustration of such a zone player. Other types of zone players can not include the speaker unit e.g. such as shown in or the audio amplifier e.g. such as shown in . Further it is contemplated that the zone player can be integrated into another component. For example the zone player could be constructed as part of a lamp for indoor or outdoor use.

Referring back to the network interface facilitates a data flow between zone players and other devices on a data network e.g. the data network of and the zone player . In some embodiments the network interface can manage the assembling of an audio source or file into smaller packets that are to be transmitted over the data network or reassembles received packets into the original source or file. In some embodiments the network interface can further handle the address part of each packet so that it gets to the right destination or intercepts packets destined for the zone player . Accordingly in certain embodiments each of the packets includes an Internet Protocol IP based source address as well as an IP based destination address.

In some embodiments the network interface can include one or both of a wireless interface and a wired interface . The wireless interface also referred to as an RF interface provides network interface functions for the zone player to wirelessly communicate with other devices e.g. other zone player s speaker s receiver s component s associated with the data network and so on in accordance with a communication protocol e.g. any of the wireless standards IEEE 802.11a 802.11b 802.11g 802.11n or 802.15 . To receive wireless signals and to provide the wireless signals to the wireless interface and to transmit wireless signals the zone player of includes one or more antennas . The wired interface provides network interface functions for the zone player to communicate over a wire with other devices in accordance with a communication protocol e.g. IEEE 802.3 . In some embodiments a zone player includes both of the interfaces and . In some embodiments a zone player includes only the wireless interface or the wired interface .

In some embodiments the processor is a clock driven electronic device that is configured to process input data according to instructions stored in memory . The memory is data storage that can be loaded with one or more software modules which can be executed by the processor to achieve certain tasks. In the illustrated embodiment the memory is a tangible machine readable medium storing instructions that can be executed by the processor . In some embodiments a task might be for the zone player to retrieve audio data from another zone player or a device on a network. In some embodiments a task might be for the zone player to send audio data to another zone player or device on a network. In some embodiments a task might be for the zone player to synchronize playback of audio with one or more additional zone players. In some embodiments a task might be to pair the zone player with one or more zone players to create a multi channel audio environment. Additional or alternative tasks can be achieved via the one or more software modules and the processor .

The audio processing component can include one or more digital to analog converters DAC an audio preprocessing component an audio enhancement component or a digital signal processor and so on. In certain embodiments the audio that is retrieved via the network interface is processed and or intentionally altered by the audio processing component . Further the audio processing component can produce analog audio signals. The processed analog audio signals are then provided to the audio amplifier for play back through speakers . In addition the audio processing component can include necessary circuitry to process analog or digital signals as inputs to play from zone player send to another zone player on a network or both play and send to another zone player on the network. An example input includes a line in connection e.g. an auto detecting 3.5 mm audio line in connection .

The audio amplifier is a device that amplifies audio signals to a level for driving one or more speakers . The one or more speakers can include an individual transducer e.g. a driver or a complete speaker system that includes an enclosure including one or more drivers. A particular driver can be a subwoofer for low frequencies a mid range driver middle frequencies and a tweeter high frequencies for example. An enclosure can be sealed or ported for example.

A zone player can also be referred to herein as a playback device. An example playback device includes a Sonos Play 5 which is manufactured by Sonos Inc. of Santa Barbara Calif. The Play 5 is an example zone player with a built in amplifier and speakers. In particular the Play 5 is a five driver speaker system that includes two tweeters two mid range drivers and one subwoofer. When playing audio content via the Play 5 the left audio data of a track is sent out of the left tweeter and left mid range driver the right audio data of a track is sent out of the right tweeter and the right mid range driver and mono bass is sent out of the subwoofer. Further both mid range drivers and both tweeters have the same equalization or substantially the same equalization . That is they are both sent the same frequencies just from different channels of audio. Audio from Internet radio stations online music and video services downloaded music analog audio inputs television DVD and so on can be played from a Sonos Play 5. While the Play 5 is an example of a zone player with speakers it is understood that a zone player with speakers is not limited to one with a certain number of speakers e.g. five speakers as in the Play 5 but rather can contain one or more speakers. Further a zone player can be part of another device which might even serve a purpose different than audio e.g. a lamp .

Referring now to there is shown an example controller which can correspond to the controlling device in . The controller can be used to facilitate the control of multi media applications automation and others in a system. In particular the controller is configured to facilitate a selection of a plurality of audio sources available on the network and enable control of one or more zone players e.g. the zone players in through a wireless network interface . According to one embodiment the wireless communications is based on an industry standard e.g. infrared radio wireless standards IEEE 802.11a 802.11b 802.11g 802.11n or 802.15 . Further when a particular audio is being accessed via the controller or being played via a zone player a picture e.g. album art or any other data associated with the audio source can be transmitted from a zone player or other electronic device to the controller for display.

The controller is provided with a screen and an input interface that allows a user to interact with the controller for example to navigate a playlist of many multimedia items and to control operations of one or more zone players. The screen on the controller can be an LCD screen for example. The screen communicates with and is commanded by a screen driver that is controlled by a microcontroller e.g. a processor . The memory can be loaded with one or more application modules that can be executed by the microcontroller with or without a user input via the user interface to achieve certain tasks. In some embodiments an application module is configured to facilitate grouping a number of selected zone players into a zone group and synchronizing the zone players for audio play back. In some embodiments an application module is configured to control the audio sounds e.g. volume of the zone players in a zone group. In operation when the microcontroller executes one or more of the application modules the screen driver generates control signals to drive the screen to display an application specific user interface accordingly.

The controller includes a network interface that facilitates wireless communication with a zone player. In some embodiments the commands such as volume control and audio playback synchronization are sent via the network interface . In some embodiments a saved zone group configuration is transmitted between a zone player and a controller via the network interface . The controller can control one or more zone players such as of . There can be more than one controller for a particular system. Further a controller can be integrated into a zone player.

It should be noted that other network enabled devices such as an iPhone iPad or any other smart phone or network enabled device e.g. a networked computer such as a PC or Mac can also be used as a controller to interact or control zone players in a particular environment. In some embodiments a software application or upgrade can be downloaded onto a network enabled device to perform the functions described herein.

In certain embodiments a user can create a zone group including at least two zone players from the controller . The zone players in the zone group can play audio in a synchronized fashion such that all of the zone players in the zone group play back an identical audio source or a list of identical audio sources in a synchronized manner such that no or substantially no audible delays or hiccups could be heard. Similarly in some embodiments when a user increases the audio volume of the group from the controller the signals or data of increasing the audio volume for the group are sent to one of the zone players and causes other zone players in the group to be increased together in volume.

A user via the controller can group zone players into a zone group by activating a Link Zones or Add Zone soft button or de grouping a zone group by activating an Unlink Zones or Drop Zone button. For example one mechanism for joining zone players together for audio play back is to link a number of zone players together to form a group. To link a number of zone players together a user can manually link each zone player or room one after the other. For example assume that there is a multi zone system that includes the following zones Bathroom Bedroom Den Dining Room Family Room and Foyer.

In certain embodiments a user can link any number of the six zone players for example by starting with a single zone and then manually linking each zone to that zone.

In certain embodiments a set of zones can be dynamically linked together using a command to create a zone scene or theme subsequent to first creating the zone scene . For instance a Morning zone scene command can link the Bedroom Office and Kitchen zones together in one action. Without this single command the user would need to manually and individually link each zone. The single command might include a mouse click a double mouse click a button press a gesture or some other programmed action. Other kinds of zone scenes can be programmed.

In certain embodiments a zone scene can be triggered based on time e.g. an alarm clock function . For instance a zone scene can be set to apply at 8 00 am. The system can link appropriate zones automatically set specific music to play and then stop the music after a defined duration. Although any particular zone can be triggered to an On or Off state based on time for example a zone scene enables any zone s linked to the scene to play a predefined audio e.g. a favorable song a predefined playlist at a specific time and or for a specific duration. If for any reason the scheduled music failed to be played e.g. an empty playlist no connection to a share failed Universal Plug and Play UPnP no Internet connection for an Internet Radio station and so on a backup buzzer can be programmed to sound. The buzzer can include a sound file that is stored in a zone player for example.

Certain particular examples will now be provided in connection with to describe for purposes of illustration only certain base systems and methods to provide and facilitate connection to a playback network. shows that there are three zone players and and a controller that form a network branch that is also referred to as an Ad Hoc network . The network may be wireless wired or a combination of wired and wireless. In general an Ad Hoc or spontaneous network is a local area network or other small network in which there is no one access point for all traffic. With an established Ad Hoc network the devices and can all communicate with each other in a peer to peer style of communication for example. Furthermore devices may come and go from the network and the network will automatically reconfigure itself without needing the user to reconfigure the network .

Using the Ad Hoc network the devices and can share or exchange one or more audio sources and be grouped to play the same or different audio sources. For example the devices and are grouped to playback one piece of music and at the same time the device plays back another piece of music. In other words the devices and as shown in form a HOUSEHOLD that distributes audio and or reproduces sound. As used herein the term HOUSEHOLD provided in uppercase letters to disambiguate from the user s domicile is used to represent a collection of networked devices that are cooperating to provide an application or service. An instance of a HOUSEHOLD is identified with a household or household identifier .

In certain embodiments a household identifier HHID is a short string or an identifier that is computer generated to help ensure that it is unique. Accordingly the network can be characterized by a unique HHID and a unique set of configuration variables or parameters such as channels e.g. respective frequency bands SSID a sequence of alphanumeric characters as a name of a wireless network and WEP keys wired equivalent privacy or other security keys . In certain embodiments SSID is set to be the same as HHID.

In certain embodiments each HOUSEHOLD includes two types of network nodes a control point CP and a zone player ZP . The control point controls an overall network setup process and sequencing including an automatic generation of required network parameters e.g. WEP keys . In an embodiment the CP also provides the user with a HOUSEHOLD configuration user interface. The CP function can be provided by a computer running a CP application module or by a handheld controller e.g. the controller also running a CP application module for example. The zone player is any other device on the network that is placed to participate in the automatic configuration process. The ZP as a notation used herein includes the controller or a computing device for example.

In certain embodiments configuration of a HOUSEHOLD involves multiple CPs and ZPs that rendezvous and establish a known configuration such that they can use a standard networking protocol e.g. IP over Wired or Wireless Ethernet for communication. In an embodiment two types of networks protocols are employed Ethernet 802.3 and Wireless 802.11g. Interconnections between a CP and a ZP can use either of the networks protocols. A device in the system as a member of a HOUSEHOLD can connect to both networks simultaneously. In an environment that has both networks in use it is assumed that at least one device in a system is connected to both as a bridging device thus providing bridging services between wired wireless networks for others. The zone player in is shown to be connected to both networks for example. The connectivity to the network is based on Ethernet while the connectivity to other devices and is based on Wireless. It is understood however that in some embodiments each zone player may access the Internet when retrieving media from the cloud e.g. Internet via the bridging device. For example zone player may contain a uniform resource locator URL that specifies an address to a particular audio track in the cloud. Using the URL the zone player may retrieve the audio track from the cloud and ultimately play the audio out of one or more zone players.

Certain embodiments enable a user to stream music from a music playing application e.g. browser based application native music player other multimedia application and so on to a local multimedia content playback e.g. Sonos system. Certain embodiments provide secure systems and methods for multimedia content playback across a plurality of systems and locations. Certain embodiments facilitate integration between content partners and a playback system as well as supporting maintenance of such content and system.

As illustrated by the example system of a plurality of content providers can be connected to one or more local playback networks via a cloud and or other network . Using the cloud a multimedia playback system e.g. Sonos a mobile device a third party application a retail location and so on can provide multimedia content requested or otherwise to local playback networks . Within each local network a controller and or playback device can provide a song identifier song name playlist identifier playlist name genre preference and so on and or simply receive content from a connected system via the cloud.

For example a user listens to a third party music application e.g. Pandora Rhapsody Spotify and so on on her smart phone while commuting. She s enjoying the current channel and as she walks in the door to her home selects an option to continue playing that channel on her household music playback system e.g. Sonos . The playback system picks up from the same spot on the selected channel that was on her phone and outputs that content e.g. that song on speakers and or other playback devices connected to the household playback system. A uniform resource indicator URI e.g. a uniform resource locator URL can be passed to a playback device to fetch content from a cloud and or other networked source for example. A playback device such as a zone player can fetch content on its own without use of a controller for example. Once the zone player has a URL or some other identification or address for a song and or playlist the zone player can run on its own to fetch the content. Songs and or other multimedia content can be retrieved from the Internet rather than a local device e.g. a compact disc CD for example. A third party application can open or utilize an application programming interface API to pass music to the household playback system without tight coupling to that household playback system.

In another example of an application determining a playlist and or other content for playback a user enjoys listening to music on an online music service e.g. turntable.fm or other virtual room that a user can enter to choose from a plurality of online disc jockeys DJs deciding what to play next using his Mac Book Pro at home. He likes the unique user experience the service offers and he frequently hops from room to room discovering new music. To maximize sound quality he plays the music on his household playback system e.g. Sonos . A button or other indicator can be added to the turntable.fm Web application to switch the content being played to the playback system for output e.g. to the Sonos system rather than or in addition to the Mac Book . While Web based applications typically do not have access to items on a local network certain embodiments enable a third party Web based application e.g. Turntable.fm to talk to a playback system e.g. Sonos in a certain way e.g. may have to log in with a username and password and the identified user has the website send audio or audio and video down to a playback device e.g. a zone player on the playback system local network to play music there or some other media .

In another example a first user creates a playlist e.g. a Spotify playlist . The first user visits a second user s house pulls out her smart phone and shares her playlist by playing it on the second user s household playback e.g. Sonos system using her third party e.g. Spotify application. The first user may also go to the third party content provider s e.g. Spotify s website and share her playlist on the second user s playback system.

Thus certain embodiments provide cross service linking such that a song identifier can be passed from one user and or service to another to be fetched and played. A user having a playlist on his or her phone can visit a friend and using her account on her friend s system play a song to which she has an access right. A retrieved song can streamed locally to a user s phone or an application can pass a song identifier to a local playback system which looks up the song identifier and finds an available audio stream to which the user has a right to play and then plays that song.

In another example a user is staying in a hotel room or other facility including a local playback network. For example a speaker and or other playback device e.g. a Sonos Play 3 Play 5 and so on in a hotel room can be utilized to play multimedia content to which the user has access from his or her playback network account streaming audio source third party application and so on. Content can be output to one or more devices based on availability access configuration priority preference and so on. In certain embodiments a playback network includes a plurality of nodes and each node has a capability to play sound in response to an input. Requested output is provided to a most logical connection for example.

In certain embodiments a phone device a television device and so on can be used to play music audio video and or other multimedia content. In an example a push button on a microphone or household intercom system to tell the kids dinner is ready is provided over the local playback network.

At block the incoming content e.g. audio stream is provided directly from a third party application or other external source to the local playback network for playback. For example rather than passing track identifiers an audio stream is provided to a Sonos household system for playback to one or more configured zones. At block the local playback system consumes the stream and plays it as it would other content on the local playback e.g. Sonos network e.g. via zones and so on . At block a playback device e.g. a zone player Play 3 Play 5 and so on adds timing information to the streaming content signal e.g. the device takes the streaming audio signal and repackages it for local synchronized playback . In some embodiments timing information is not added to the signal unless two or more playback devices are configured to play the audio in synchrony.

In certain embodiments an application associated with the operating system can register to handle all URIs URLs that start with a certain prefix and can define how data is encoded into those URLs so a local playback system application can generate a link e.g. sonos and put that link into a message e.g. email text message instant message IM etc. . The local playback application registered to handle such URLs can parse the URLs to determine what song playlist streaming radio station etc. to play. This launches the controller application. For example if a first listener likes a song and tweets that song Twitter can include a clickable link which launches a playback application and starts the music playing on a local playback system if the local system can find the song e.g. if have the application if have rights access to the song etc. . In certain embodiments the system knows to trigger the receiving user s system rather than the sending user s system to play associated content based on the transmitted link identifier.

For example an application can register with the system to handle all URLs that start with a custom prefix e.g. an HTTP scheme . For instance Sonos controller apps can register to handle any URL that begins with sonos or x sonos . In certain embodiments a playback system provider can define and publish the format of its URLs so that any third party application can create a link or reference to content. A large amount of data can be encoded into a URL using query parameters for example.

In an example when an application tries to open or browse to a URL the system checks to see if the scheme of the URL matches the sonos scheme that has been registered with the application. If a URL handler application is found the system launches that application e.g. the application can but does not need to be running in the background and passes the URL to the application. The application then parses the URL and executes functionality based on the data in the URL. For example the URL can contain the name of a music service and a playlist identifier from that service plus the name of a Sonos Zone Player causing the Sonos controller to start that playlist playing on that zone.

In certain embodiments a single sign on technology is provided so that the user does not need to re enter a username and password in order to authenticate to the playback server. Example single sign on technologies include Facebook Connect Windows Live ID etc.

In certain embodiments instead of using a specialized link such as a sonos link a normal URL can be used to point to a playback system e.g. Sonos webserver which generates links with special data embedded in the link. A playback system is identified and content identified by the URL can be playing at via the local playback network e.g. mesh network configured for home hotel room etc. . Parameters such as authentication security location and so on can be configured for local playback of remote content.

In certain embodiments a local playback controller application is not involved. Information passed over to the local playback device may include an identifier for a single track a playlist a streaming radio station a programmed radio station and so on. This information can also include a current play position within a list to enable near seamless handoff of music from a portable device to a local playback system. Once the music information is handed from the third party application to the local playback system there is no further synchronization between the two systems.

A connection between the third party application and the local playback device e.g. Sonos ZonePlayer can be direct over a local area network LAN remote through a proxy server in the cloud and so on. A LAN delivery approach may be easier to integrate into native applications e.g. applications written for iOS or Android and a proxy server approach may be easier for third party applications that are browser based for example.

In certain embodiments information is provided from a third party application to a local playback system without being routed through or by a controller application. Here the third party application is communicating with the multimedia playback device e.g. a Sonos ZonePlayer . Information can be passed locally rather than through the Internet for example. The local playback device accesses the Internet to find content to stream and the third party application takes the place of the controller application e.g. throw it over the wall the application passes information and the local playback system runs it .

Certain embodiments provide an approach similar to the throw it over the wall or one way communication approach of except that the third party application not only tells the local playback system what to play but also maintains two way communication with the local playback e.g. Sonos system. Two way communication helps enable features such as keeping a local playback queue synchronized with a queue that the user is editing managing in the third party application allow the third party application to know what is currently playing on the local playback system allow integrated transport control between the third party application and the local playback system and so on.

In certain embodiments a local playback system can pass information back to a third party application to indicate a current point of playback e.g. now playing a third song in a playlist fourth song in the playlist and so on . The local playback system can pass parameter information such as a change in volume from a local multimedia playback device to the third party application so the application can reflect the change in volume to the user via its graphical user interface. The third party application can instruct the local playback system to skip a song go to a certain location and so on.

Certain embodiments provide a third party mode that allows users to select from any local playback network e.g. Sonos controller to listen to audio from one or more third party applications on their smartphones or tablets e.g. Android devices . For example a user may be using a local playback network controller application and now wants a third party application to appear as an audio source within the controller application. The user can then select the controller application that he or she wishes to play audio from the third party application for example.

Certain embodiments provide queue management to allow a third party application to control a local playback queue. That is the local playback system has a queue but the third party application allows users to add delete and so on from the queue for example. Rather than switch from content that the user is currently playing the local playback system allows a user to create a playlist on the fly. For example if last.fm users vote that they do not like a song and it should be skipped then the local playback system will skip it.

Certain embodiments allow a third party application to override a local playback queue with its own application specific queue. The local playback system periodically fetches a short list of tracks to play next. The list of tracks to play is determined by the third party application for example. In certain embodiments a shared queue is provided between the local playback system and the third party application to keep the local system and application synchronized.

Certain embodiments allow control of playback system functions and or settings via an external e.g. third party application. For example a local playback system can allow volume control play pause and so on and can interact with an application running on a given platform operating system OS . Certain embodiments provide a Web API that can be used to access functionality.

Certain embodiments facilitate control of a local playback system from outside a household or other location at which the local playback network is configured. For example a user can queue up music while away from his or her house. The application can facilitate setup and or configuration. For example a third party application may ask the user to enter a Sonos customer email address and password. The application can then make a request to a Sonos server in the cloud to determine the zone groups on which music can be played.
