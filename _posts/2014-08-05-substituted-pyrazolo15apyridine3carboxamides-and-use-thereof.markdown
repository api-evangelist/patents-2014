This application is a U.S. National Stage Application filed under 35 U.S.C. 371 of International Application No. PCT EP2014 066780 filed Aug. 5 2014 the contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference for all purposes which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 to European Patent Application Nos. 13179782.1 filed Aug. 8 2013 and Ser.

The present application relates to novel substituted pyrazolo 1 5 a pyridine 3 carboxamides to processes for preparation thereof to the use thereof alone or in combinations for treatment and or prophylaxis of diseases and to the use thereof for production of medicaments for treatment and or prophylaxis of diseases especially for treatment and or prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders.

One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate cGMP . Together with nitrogen monoxide NO which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals it forms the NO cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyse the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate GTP . The representatives of this family known to date can be divided into two groups either according to structural features or according to the type of ligands the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one haem per heterodimer which is part of the regulatory centre. This is of central importance for the activation mechanism. NO is able to bind to the iron atom of haem and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Haem free preparations cannot by contrast be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide CO is also able to bind to the central iron atom of haem but the stimulation by CO is much less than that by NO.

Through the formation of cGMP and the resulting regulation of phosphodiesterases ion channels and protein kinases guanylate cyclase plays a crucial role in different physiological processes more particularly in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells in platelet aggregation and platelet adhesion and in neuronal signal transmission and also in the event of disorders based on disruption of the abovementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions the NO cGMP system can be suppressed which can lead for example to hypertension platelet activation increased cell proliferation endothelial dysfunction atherosclerosis angina pectoris heart failure myocardial infarction thromboses stroke and sexual dysfunction.

Owing to the expected high efficiency and low level of side effects a possible NO independent treatment for such disorders by targeting the influence of the cGMP signal pathway in organisms is a promising approach.

Therapeutic stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase has to date been accomplished using exclusively compounds such as organic nitrates the effect of which is based on NO. The latter is formed by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attack at the central iron atom of haem. In addition to the side effects the development of tolerance is one of the crucial disadvantages of this mode of treatment.

In the last few years there have been descriptions of some compounds which stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase directly i.e. without prior release of NO for example 3 5 hydroxymethyl 2 furyl 1 benzylindazole YC 1 Wu et al. 84 1994 4226 M lsch et al. 120 1997 681 fatty acids Goldberg et al. 252 1977 1279 diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate Pettibone et al. 116 1985 307 isoliquiritigenin Yu et al. 114 1995 1587 and various substituted pyrazole derivatives WO 98 16223 .

WO 2012 072512 A1 and WO 2010 117787 among other documents disclose various pyrazolo 1 5 a pyridine derivatives which can be used for treatment of disorders.

It was an object of the present invention to provide novel substances which act as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase and are suitable as such for treatment and or prophylaxis of diseases.

Inventive compounds are the compounds of the formula I and the salts solvates and solvates of the salts thereof the compounds encompassed by formula I of the formulae specified hereinafter and the salts solvates and solvates of the salts thereof and the compounds encompassed by formula I and specified hereinafter as working examples and the salts solvates and solvates of the salts thereof to the extent that the compounds encompassed by formula I and specified hereinafter are not already salts solvates and solvates of the salts.

In the context of the present invention preferred salts are physiologically acceptable salts of the inventive compounds. Also encompassed are salts which are not themselves suitable for pharmaceutical applications but can be used for example for isolation or purification of the inventive compounds.

Physiologically acceptable salts of the inventive compounds include acid addition salts of mineral acids carboxylic acids and sulphonic acids for example salts of hydrochloric acid hydrobromic acid sulphuric acid phosphoric acid methanesulphonic acid ethanesulphonic acid toluenesulphonic acid benzenesulphonic acid naphthalenedisulphonic acid formic acid acetic acid trifluoroacetic acid propionic acid lactic acid tartaric acid malic acid citric acid fumaric acid maleic acid and benzoic acid.

Physiologically acceptable salts of the inventive compounds also include salts of conventional bases by way of example and with preference alkali metal salts e.g. sodium and potassium salts alkaline earth metal salts e.g. calcium and magnesium salts and ammonium salts derived from ammonia or organic amines having 1 to 16 carbon atoms by way of example and with preference ethylamine diethylamine triethylamine ethyldiisopropylamine monoethanolamine diethanolamine triethanolamine dicyclohexylamine dimethylaminoethanol procaine dibenzylamine N methylmorpholine arginine lysine ethylenediamine and N methylpiperidine.

In the context of the invention solvates refer to those forms of the inventive compounds which in the solid or liquid state form a complex by coordination with solvent molecules. Hydrates are a specific form of solvates in which the coordination is with water. Preferred solvates in the context of the present invention are hydrates.

Depending on their structure the inventive compounds may exist in different stereoisomeric forms i.e. in the form of configurational isomers or if appropriate also as conformational isomers enantiomers and or diastereomers including those in the case of atropisomers . The present invention therefore encompasses the enantiomers and diastereomers and the respective mixtures thereof. The stereoisomerically homogeneous constituents can be isolated from such mixtures of enantiomers and or diastereomers in a known manner chromatography processes are preferably used for this purpose more particularly HPLC chromatography on an achiral or chiral phase.

If the inventive compounds can occur in tautomeric forms the present invention encompasses all the tautomeric forms.

The present invention also encompasses all suitable isotopic variants of the inventive compounds. An isotopic variant of an inventive compound is understood here to mean a compound in which at least one atom within the inventive compound has been exchanged for another atom of the same atomic number but with a different atomic mass from the atomic mass which usually or predominantly occurs in nature. Examples of isotopes which can be incorporated into an inventive compound are those of hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen phosphorus sulphur fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine such as H deuterium H tritium C C N O O P P S S S S F Cl Br I I I and I. Particular isotopic variants of an inventive compound especially those in which one or more radioactive isotopes have been incorporated may be beneficial for example for the examination of the mechanism of action or of the active ingredient distribution in the body due to comparatively easy preparability and detectability especially compounds labelled with H or C isotopes are suitable for this purpose. In addition the incorporation of isotopes for example of deuterium can lead to particular therapeutic benefits as a consequence of greater metabolic stability of the compound for example an extension of the half life in the body or a reduction in the active dose required such modifications of the inventive compounds may therefore in some cases also constitute a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Isotopic variants of the inventive compounds can be prepared by the processes known to those skilled in the art for example by the methods described below and the procedures described in the working examples by using corresponding isotopic modifications of the respective reagents and or starting compounds.

In addition the present invention also encompasses prodrugs of the inventive compounds.

For each day of the experiment the data obtained are stored in a dedicated file bearing the experiment number. Results and test protocols are filed in paper form sorted by numbers.

The pharmacokinetic parameters of the inventive compounds are determined in male CD 1 mice male Wistar rats and female beagles. Intravenous administration in the case of mice and rats is effected by means of a species specific plasma DMSO formulation and in the case of dogs by means of a water PEG400 ethanol formulation. In all species oral administration of the dissolved substance is performed via gavage based on a water PEG400 ethanol formulation. The removal of blood from rats is simplified by inserting a silicone catheter into the right Vena jugularis externa prior to substance administration. The operation is effected at least one day prior to the experiment with isofluran anaesthesia and administration of an analgesic atropine rimadyl 3 1 0.1 ml s.c. . The blood is taken generally more than 10 time points within a time window including terminal time points of at least 24 to a maximum of 72 hours after substance administration. The blood is removed into heparinized tubes. The blood plasma is then obtained by centrifugation if required it can be stored at 20 C. until further processing.

An internal standard which may also be a chemically unrelated substance is added to the samples of the inventive compounds calibration samples and qualifiers and there follows protein precipitation by means of acetonitrile in excess. Addition of a buffer solution matched to the LC conditions and subsequent vortexing is followed by centrifugation at 1000 g. The supernatant is analysed by means of LC MS MS using C18 reversed phase columns and variable mobile phase mixtures. The substances are quantified via the peak heights or areas from extracted ion chromatograms of specific selected ion monitoring experiments.

The plasma concentration time plots determined are used to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters such as AUC C t terminal half life F bioavailability MRT mean residence time and CL clearance by means of a validated pharmacokinetic calculation program.

Since the substance quantification is performed in plasma it is necessary to determine the blood plasma distribution of the substance in order to be able to adjust the pharmacokinetic parameters correspondingly. For this purpose a defined amount of substance is incubated in heparinized whole blood of the species in question in a rocking roller mixer for 20 min. After centrifugation at 1000 g the plasma concentration is measured by means of LC MS MS see above and determined by calculating the ratio of the C Cvalue.

The inventive compounds were incubated with a concentration of about 0.1 10 M. To this end stock solutions of the inventive compounds having a concentration of 0.01 1 mM in acetonitrile were prepared and then pipetted with 1 100 dilution into the incubation mixture. Liver microsomes and recombinant enzymes were incubated at 37 C. in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 with and without NADPH generating system consisting of 1 mM NADP 10 mM glucose 6 phosphate and 1 unit glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase. Primary hepatocytes were incubated in suspension in Williams E medium likewise at 37 C. After an incubation time of 0 4 h the incubation mixtures were quenched with acetonitrile final concentration about 30 and the protein was centrifuged off at about 15 000 g. The samples thus quenched were either analysed directly or stored at 20 C. until analysis.

The analysis is carried out by high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet and mass spectrometry detection HPLC UV MS MS .

The hERG human ether a go go related gene potassium current makes a significant contribution to the repolarization of the human cardiac action potential Scheel et al. 2011 . Inhibition of this current by pharmaceuticals can in rare cases cause potentially lethal cardiac arrythmia and is therefore studied at an early stage during drug development.

The functional hERG assay used here is based on a recombinant HEK293 cell line which stably expresses the KCNH2 HERG gene Zhou et al. 1998 . These cells are studied by means of the whole cell voltage clamp technique Hamill et al. 1981 in an automated system Patchliner Nanion Munich Germany which controls the membrane voltage and measures the hERG potassium current at room temperature. The PatchControlHT software Nanion controls the Patchliner system data capture and data analysis. The voltage is controlled by 2 EPC 10 quadro amplifiers controlled by the PatchMasterPro software both HEKA Elektronik Lambrecht Germany NPC 16 chips with moderate resistance 2 M Nanion serve as the planar substrate for the voltage clamp experiments.

NPC 16 chips are filled with intra and extracellular solution cf. Himmel 2007 and with cell suspension. After forming a gigaohm seal and establishing whole cell mode including several automated quality control steps the cell membrane is clamped at the 80 mV holding potential. The subsequent voltage clamp protocol changes the command voltage to 20 mV for 1000 ms 120 mV for 500 ms and back to the 80 mV holding potential this is repeated every 12 s. After an initial stabilization phase about 5 6 minutes test substance solution is introduced by pipette in rising concentrations e.g. 0.1 1 and 10 mol l exposure about 5 6 minutes per concentration followed by several washing steps.

The amplitude of the upward tail current which is generated by a change in potential from 20 mV to 120 mV serves to quantify the hERG potassium current and is described as a function of time IgorPro Software . The current amplitude at the end of various time intervals for example stabilization phase before first substance first second third concentration of test substance serves to establish a concentration effect curve from which the half maximum inhibiting concentration ICof the test substance is calculated.
