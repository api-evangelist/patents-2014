This application claims the right of priority based on Taiwan Patent Application No. 100135801 entitled Method and Computer System For Providing Time Ratio Based Password Challenge Authentication filed on Sep. 30 2011. The entire content of the aforementioned application is incorporated herein by reference. This application is a Division of U.S. application Ser. No. 13 624 127 filed on Sep. 21 2012.

Daily life requires the use of a wide variety of information devices such as mobile phones personal computers notebook computers and tablet computers. The information devices may keep users personal data and identity data. Due to the prevalence of networks an increasing number of network functions are performed on line. In particular servers have to store users personal data and identity data in order to provide network services such as social networking services webpage email services mobile commerce services banking on line transaction services database access services or content and information provider services. Hence to ensure security and privacy the servers usually require that before accessing the services provided by the servers users have to follow an authentication procedure for recognizing the users identity. At present one of the most common authentication procedures is a password based challenge authentication procedure whereby a server typically requires that before accessing its services users ought to enter a username and a password for identity recognition or known as login in order to prevent user personal data from being stolen or fraudulently changed.

With network coverage and accessibility increasing rapidly hackers are becoming more likely to target a user s password with a view to faking the user s identity. Therefore simple passwords no longer provide adequate protection in view of this various mechanisms are put forth to provide better protection. For example users are required to create a password that meets the requirements of password length complexity and unpredictability such that the strength of the password is sufficient to fend off brute force search attacks and dictionary attacks. Furthermore users are required to change their passwords regularly to invalidate old passwords thereby reducing the chance that their passwords will be cracked. The aforesaid mechanisms enhance security and thus help users protect their accounts.

However referring to a client end requests access to different web services and an authentication procedure of a username password provided by website A website B and website C through a network by means of a challenge . In practice most users usually use different usernames passwords to log in website A website B and website C respectively. The mechanisms require users to memorize passwords for accessing the web services of different websites respectively. Furthermore users usually log in a small number of websites on a daily basis and thus are unlikely to memorize accurately the passwords of those websites which are seldom visited by them hence they have to guess the rarely used passwords not to mention that their accounts would be locked out after incorrect password entries.

Therefore there is a need to assist users in memorizing troublesome passwords while ensuring security. A solution lies in conventional one time password OTP technology. However OTP technology can provide passwords to users only when additional technology is accessible. In most circumstances OTP technology requires an electronic device. Chances are the electronic device will get lost and thus the risk of losing the passwords is always there. Furthermore it is unlikely for an organization to share its OTP generation mechanism with another organization hence to access web services provided by different websites respectively a user has to use their respective electronic devices. Therefore users have to carry multiple portable electronic devices thereby adding to a loss risk.

Another solution is provided by a password hint mechanism. However the mechanism works at the cost of undermining password security because unauthorized persons can also see the password hint and therefore help a hacker crack the password. Furthermore the mechanism is not effective in giving an appropriate password hint to a complicated password. Therefore sensitive systems nowadays seldom use the mechanism.

Lots of methods for providing a more secure password based challenge have been proposed one of which can be referred to U.S. Pat. No. 7 653 818 which is incorporated herein by its entirety. It disclosed a method of incorporating password with a timing factor such as time limit of keystrokes a predetermined length of pause between keystrokes etc. to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access.

An embodiment can include a method of providing registration for password challenge authentication. The method includes receiving an access code or pattern inputted by a user recording a time message associated with each component of the access code or pattern using a processor generating a data record in combining each component of the access code or pattern with the associated time message and storing the data record.

Another embodiment can include a method. The method includes calculating a beat ratio from a first ending component of a stored access code or pattern and of a user inputted access code or pattern using a processor transforming each component of the stored access code or pattern by means of the beat ratio calculating an acceptable beat range by means of a predetermined acceptable threshold and determining whether within the acceptable beat range each component of the user inputted access code or pattern matches the corresponding component of the stored access code or pattern.

Another embodiment can include a system. The system includes a processor configured to initiate executable operations for providing registration for time ratio based password challenge authentication. The executable operations include receiving an access code or pattern inputted by a user recording a time message associated with each component of the access code or pattern generating a data record in combining each component of the access code or pattern with the associated time message and storing the data record.

Another embodiment can include a system. The system includes a processor configured to initiate executable operations for providing login for time ratio based password challenge authentication. The executable operations include calculating a beat ratio from a first ending component of a stored access code or pattern and of a user inputted access code or pattern transforming each component of the stored access code or pattern by means of the beat ratio calculating an acceptable beat range by means of a predetermined acceptable threshold and determining whether within the acceptable beat range each component of the user inputted access code or pattern matches the corresponding component of the stored access code or pattern.

Another embodiment can include a computer program product for providing registration for password challenge authentication. The computer program product includes a computer readable storage medium having stored thereon program code that when executed configures a processor to perform executable operations.

The hardware framework of a server is identical or similar to that of the client computer or is any conventional basic framework and the embodiments of the present invention is not limited thereto. For example the server is a desktop computer a notebook computer a personal digital assistant PDA or a smartphone. However and the above examples are not restrictive of the one or more embodiments of the present invention. The client computer includes a browser. The browser includes a program module and instructions. The program module and commands comply with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP whereby a World Wide Web WWW client i.e. the client computer sends and receives web based messages through the Internet thereby effectuating communication with the server .

An application includes a password based challenge module of the embodiments of the present invention. The password based challenge module includes a program module and commands. The program module and commands can communicate with the server so as to recognize a user s identity. The password based challenge module is a module in the application or is implemented in the form of a daemon. In another embodiment the password based challenge module is implemented as a program in another form. The password based challenge module includes a code for executing the procedures described below and depicted with and .

The hardware elements depicted in the client computer are not intended to be exhaustive but rather are representative to highlight essential components required by the embodiments of the present invention. For instance client computer may include alternate memory storage devices such as magnetic cassettes Digital Versatile Disks DVDs Bernoulli cartridges and the like. These and other variations are intended to be within the spirit and scope of the present invention.

Step receiving an account number and a password inputted by a user or pattern inputted through a touch screen .

Step recording a time message associated with each component of the password or pattern . When inputting through keyboard said each component is each keystroke character of the password entered. When inputting through touch screen said each component is each keystroke or each stroke of the password entered through a virtual keyboard or a simulated piano keyboard. More details are described later with reference to .

Step generating a data record in combining each component of the password or pattern with the associated time message.

It is noted that some authentication mechanisms do not include user account number only request for password to authorize access. For example such authentication mechanisms include PIN input or power on or unlock password input of mobile phones or mobile devices e.g. tablet computers such as iPad .

When the user intends to login and inputs the password the time of duration of the first ending component in the password or pattern can serve as a base which is compared with the duration of time of a corresponding component of the password or pattern stored in the database to calculate a beat ratio R. The product of the duration of time of other component of the password multiplied by the beat ratio constitutes the corresponding time of the component of the password entered by the user i.e. 0R 1R X3Y5 0R 3R X1Y1 2R 4R X2Y3 3R 4R X3Y5 4R 5R REST 5R 6R X2Y3 . An acceptable range of the beat ratio is further calculated by means of a predetermined acceptable threshold. Therefore in one or more embodiments of the present invention passwords entered in a same input sequence and according to an input beat within the predetermined acceptable threshold range are considered as the same password and the login will be granted. For example according to the present invention the sequential input of Do Re Mi is considered the same as the input of Do Re Mi . That is the passwords entered according to different tempo slower or faster are considered as the same password.

From it can be seen that the embodiments of the present invention also allows multi key or multi touch input to provide a function similar to playing on a musical instrument. Therefore the embodiments of the present invention are applicable to various types of input devices such as keyboard touch screen mouse etc. The user can press the key A and the key B simultaneously or click the left button and the right button of the mouse simultaneously to serve as a part of the password.

Moreover the embodiments of the present invention can also combine audio or visual aides to assist the user in memorizing the password. For example when entering the password musical instrument sounds such as the musical sounds played on pianos or flutes corresponding to the entering tempo of the password can be provided as a prompt to the user. For touch screen input it is possible to combine virtual keyboard or simulated piano keyboard to facilitate the entering of password by the user. The use of application module of simulated flute e.g. App on the iPhone to facilitate the input of password is also possible. By means of flute sounds from the microphone of information devices it is possible to facilitate the input of password during some circumstances such as unlock before driving. These kinds of mechanisms increase the complexity of password thus enhancing security with easy memorable characteristic.

Step dynamically comparing the inputted password or pattern with a stored password or pattern. The step is further explained below.

Step calculating a beat ratio R from a first ending component of the stored password or pattern and of the user inputted password or pattern.

Step transforming each component of the stored access code or pattern by means of the beat ratio. That is the time of duration of each component of the access code is multiplied by the beat ratio R to constitute a corresponding time of the component of the password subsequently entered by the user. For example the user enters the password with a faster tempo wherein the first input is 0 0.5 X3Y5 . If the beat ratio R is 0.5 i.e. R 0.5 the subsequent password components must match this beat ratio. Therefore 0R 3R X1Y1 will become 0 1.5 X1Y1 . The entire password must be transformed in accordance with the beat ratio into a new password.

Step determining whether within the acceptable beat range each component of the user inputted password or pattern matches the corresponding component of the stored password or pattern.

Step granting login access if each component of the user inputted access code or pattern matches the corresponding component of the stored access code or pattern Step .

It is noted that in the disclosure of the embodiments disclosed herein when the multi key or multi touch input through a touch screen is supported the password can be entered at any desirable location on the touch screen. From it can be seen that the password based challenge module can analyze the difference in vector coordination of each point such as from X1Y1 to X2Y3 to X3Y5 and calculate the slope and the angle of each vector. Since each component utilizes a relative vector coordination system it is possible to enter the password at any location on the touch screen. Different from the conventional password input on the touch screen the present invention allows the user to input the password without looking at the screen if each component of the password has a correct relative vector coordinate. In sum the embodiments of the present invention not only consider the password input sequence of the conventional password based challenge mechanism but also considers the recordation of input time required for each component the pause time between keystrokes and the beat ratio R calculated from the overall keystroke input as a part of the password. Therefore the password based challenge module not only considers the password input sequence but also considers the beat and its beat ratio instead of the actual time as in U.S. Pat. No. 7 653 818.

Furthermore the embodiments of the present invention are also applicable to a wide variety of information devices which are not Web based such as mobile phones personal computers notebook computers and tablet computers. The information devices keep users personal data and identity data and thus can also provide single machine application by means of a password based challenge module of the present invention. The password based challenge module can be a module in an application however in another embodiment it can also be implemented as a program in another form for example being integrated into an operating system level and adapted to challenge a user when starting the operating system.

The foregoing preferred embodiments are provided to illustrate and disclose the technical features of the embodiments of the present invention and are not intended to be restrictive of the scope of the embodiments of the present invention. Hence all equivalent variations or modifications made to the foregoing embodiments without departing from the spirit embodied in the disclosure of the embodiments of the present invention should fall within the scope of the embodiments of the present invention as set forth in the appended claims.
