title: Combining a QR code and an image
abstract: A QR code is combined with a base image, preserving useful functionalities of both the base image and the QR code. For example, the base image remains clearly visible and recognizable by humans; the transparent QR code remains readable by scanners; machine image search can distinguish the base image from the combined image; and faces of the combined image are usable by machine face recognition programs. A QR code is generated with transparencies for different regions. An inner portion and outer shell portion for each module each may have different transparencies. Inner portion size relative to outer shell size is selectively adjustable. The generated QR code image may be combined with a given base image such as a face or company logo using the transparency values of the QR code image to make the two images appear as overlaid on one another with varying degrees of transparency.

Embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to the use of QR quick response codes and more particularly to combining a QR code and an image so that both the QR code and the image retain useful functionality.

QR codes designed for tracking parts in vehicle manufacturing have become ubiquitous on account of the wide range of applications that have been found for them including advertising commercial tracking entertainment and transport ticketing product loyalty marketing e.g. QR codes used for coupons that can be redeemed using a mobile app for QR code decoding and in store product labeling as well as on account of their fast readability and greater storage capacity compared to the older UPC bar codes. Many applications apps are now available enabling for example a smartphone to be used as a QR code scanner that displays the QR code and converts it to some useful form such as a standard uniform resource locator URL for a website so that a user does not have to type the URL into a web browser to go to the site .

To illustrate a few examples of the use of such apps users may receive text add a vCard contact to their device open a uniform resource identifier URI or compose an e mail or text message after scanning QR codes. Users can generate and print their own QR codes for others to scan and use by visiting or using one of several pay or free QR code generating sites or apps. Apps for scanning QR codes can be found on nearly all smartphone devices. QR codes storing information such as addresses and URLs appear in magazines on signs on buses on business cards and on almost any object about which users might want information. Users with a camera phone equipped with a QR scanner application can scan the image of the QR code to display text or contact information connect to a wireless network or open a web page in the telephone s browser.

In the shopping industry the QR code has become a focus of advertising strategy since for example it may provide quick and effortless access to a brand s website or other direct access to information wished to be shared by an advertiser. Beyond mere convenience to the consumer one importance of this capability is that advertisers and marketers can use the behavior of scanning to encourage or aid consumers to buy their products causing the use of QR codes to have a significant impact on advertising and marketing design. One example of such impact is an increase in what is known as conversion rate e.g. the chance that contact with an advertisement will convert to a sale. Thus improvements in the use of QR codes can have a beneficial effect on commerce and the economy.

Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures in which the showings therein are for purposes of illustrating the embodiments and not for purposes of limiting them.

In accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure systems and methods are disclosed for combining a QR code image with another image that can significantly improve the quality of the result of overlaying a QR code on a background image. Prior art methods of overlaying a QR code on an image generally produce an image in which the features of the original image are not clearly evident to humans as well as not recognizable by machines as in for example image searching . Prior art examples of a QR code overlaid on a background image of a person s face are shown in . Prior art examples of a QR code overlaid on a background image of a company logo are shown in . by way of comparison shows an example of a QR code combined in accordance with an embodiment with an image of a face e.g. the same face as in to form a combined QR code base image . Also by way of comparison shows an example of a QR code combined in accordance with an embodiment with an image of a company logo e.g. the same as shown in to form a combined QR code base image .

As shown in images of a QR code combined with a background or base image e.g. person s face or company logo produced in accordance with one or more embodiments may exhibit a number of desirable properties and preserve several useful functionalities of both the base image and the QR code including 

c machine image search e.g. Google image search is able to identify the original base image from the combined QR code base image and

One or more embodiments may enable several business and other utilitarian uses for combined QR code base images. For example in a pay code product such as one provided by PayPal Inc. of San Jose Calif. the base image can be an image of the consumer so that a merchant can visually identify the consumer by face and as well as make payments through a machine by reading the QR code.

In another example combined QR code base images can enable search engine optimization and better image recognition. For example the method of combining a QR code with a base image according to one embodiment may serve as a rich search engine optimization parameter in organic searches despite absence of any meta tags on the image such as may be found in a magazine advertisement . As an illustration assume a well known shoe manufacturer has an ad of their shoes in a sports magazine. If an image of the shoes appearing in the ad is combined with a QR code using the method of combining a QR code with a base image according to one embodiment the magazine reader user can use the user s mobile app e.g. RedLaser or eBay app to do a more accurate image search on eBay and the app can navigate the user to a search results page on eBay.com listing the products that match that image. The output of the image matching may be enhanced because the image beneath the QR code can be clearer using the combined QR code base image provided according to an embodiment. The QR code that is overlaid may not cause so much distortion that can disrupt or degrade the results of an image search. Such clearer base images in combined QR code base images can encourage merchants to adopt QR code more in their product listings thereby increasing the use of scanning apps such as RedLaser. Similarly use of QR codes for promulgating the URL of the website of a company in the form of a QR code combined with a base image of the company logo can benefit from the combined QR code base image according to one or more embodiments.

In one embodiment a method for authentication of a payment card or device and authorization of a transaction may include visual identification e.g. by a merchant of a consumer using a QR code overlaid on an image of the consumer s face so that the merchant can visually identify the consumer by face and as well as make payments through a machine by reading the QR code.

In another embodiment a method for image searching may include machine searching images overlaid with QR codes in accordance with one or more embodiments. The output of the image matching may be enhanced because the image beneath the QR code may be clearer. The QR code that is overlaid would not be a distortion that degrades the results of image searches.

In one or more embodiments merchants may adopt QR codes more frequently in their product listings thereby increasing the adoption of scanning apps that can do machine image searches and read QR codes.

In one or more embodiments businesses may overlay the URL of the website of the company in the form of a QR code on an image of the company s logo.

The area of the QR code may be divided into different types of patterns as shown by the various shadings and cross hatchings seen in and indicated by the legend accompanying . Thus each module may be allocated to or belong to a particular region. Various types of regions are indicated by the legend of which accompanies the QR code example of and the matching cross hatchings and shadings of the QR code example.

Version legend item 1. of refers to the number of modules comprising the QR code and can range from 1 to 40 with version 1 having 21 21 modules and version 40 having 177 177 modules. Format legend item 2. information may record the error correction level and the mask pattern used for the QR code modules. Reed Solomon error correction may be implemented for example at one of four levels. The higher the error correction level the less is the data storage capacity for a given version but the higher is the robustness or reliability of reading the data from the QR code. Error correction levels are designated as L low 7 of codewords can be restored M medium 15 of codewords can be restored Q quartile 25 of codewords can be restored and H high 30 of codewords can be restored .

The amount of data that can be stored in the QR code may depend on the data type mode or input character set which can be for example one of numeric alphanumeric binary or kanji version 1 . . . 40 indicating the overall dimensions of the symbol and error correction level. For example the maximum storage capacities occur for version 40 error correction level L.

Data and error correction legend item 3. of encodes the data contained in the QR code as codewords using for example Reed Solomon error correction code. As seen in the data and error correction region may include most of the area or modules of the QR code .

Required patterns legend item 4. of include position also referred to as finder patterns legend item 4.1. of shown as the three blocks comprising squares e.g. several nested squares in the corners of the QR code at the top left top right and bottom left. Required patterns legend item 4. also may include alignment patterns legend item 4.2. shown as being similar to finder patterns but smaller and placed throughout the QR code. Alignment patterns may be used in versions 2 and higher and the alignment pattern positions may depend on the QR code version. Corners of the squares of finder and alignment patterns may be rounded as shown in and described further below with reference to . Additional regions of the QR code may include timing patterns legend item 4.3. shown as a row or column of alternating light and dark modules and a quiet zone legend item 5. .

Each module may have a module size expressed as the number M of pixels spanning the width or diameter of the module for pixels used to render the module. Each module e.g. module of QR code may belong or be allocated to a particular region that determines the module s functionality e.g. version format data encoding positioning and alignment as indicated by the shadings of modules shown in and the accompanying legend of .

More generally the inner portion may be of any general shape e.g. square circle star regular or irregular and not limited to squares as in the example shown in . Then the size of the inner portion may still be dependent on the size M of the module or outer shell portion but the parameters of that dependence could be defined as needed. For example if the shape is a circle there could be a number of ways to derive its radius from the module size M. One way may be to use an inner portion proportion as with the case of a square shape another way for example may be to equate the radius of the circle to the square root of the module size M and round e.g. use ceiling or floor function to the nearest number of pixels. For an example of using an inner portion proportion with a star shape or other regular or irregular shape a circle could be either inscribed inside or circumscribed outside the shape then the method used for determining the radius of the circle shape from the inner portion proportion could be used for the inscribed or circumscribed circle and then the star or other regular or irregular shape could be scaled according to the size of the inscribed or circumscribed circle.

The corners of such squares including the case of several nested squares regardless of the size of each nested square may be rounded according to a single roundness value which may be for example input to a processor executing a method such as method or method or for example a default roundness value which may be stored in a memory in communication with the processor and may be used by the method for rounding the corners of the squares. The radius of a round corner may be determined from the number S of modules spanning a side of the square using the following formula radius ceiling roundness value module size 2 . For the example shown the square which may be any of the several nested squares including the outermost and innermost squares whether dark or light of a finder pattern or an alignment pattern for example may be composed of 3 3 modules S 3 of size M 18 pixels each so that square may have a size of 54 pixels. Using a roundness value 0.5 for example the above formula yields ceiling 0.5 3 18 2 ceiling 13.5 14 pixels for the radius with a flat side of 26 pixels in between as seen in . For a rectangle the vertical number of modules may be different from the horizontal number of modules and using the different values for vertical and horizontal number of modules in the same formula yields two different values which can be used as major and minor axis values for using an ellipse to round the corners of the rectangle.

In a first stage process a QR code such as QR code or QR code may be generated for a given item or items of information referred to as a string of data. The QR code may be generated with an optimal version and error code correction level appropriate for the string of data. The QR code may be generated with several different transparency values which may reflect either or both of opacity and intensity values used with alpha compositing for different regions of the QR code. The QR code may be generated with an inner portion and an outer shell for each module with the inner portion of each module belonging to or being allocated to one of the regions and having a transparency value chosen for the region and the outer portion of each module belonging or being allocated to another of the regions and having a transparency value chosen for that region. Squares of the finder and alignment patterns may be rounded according to a chosen roundness value. Inner portions relative to outer shell size of modules in one or more of the allocated regions may be adjusted according to an inner portion proportion value.

In a second stage process the generated QR code image e.g. QR code or QR code see from process may be combined with a given base image such as a face or company logo e.g. facial image or company logo see using the transparency values of the QR code image from process to make the two images appear as overlaid on one another with varying degrees of transparency. For example as seen in modules of the finder and alignment pattern squares e.g. any of a multiple of nested squares may appear less transparent than for example modules of the data encoding regions and the inner portions and outer shell portions of modules not in the finder and alignment patterns may have different transparencies that enhance viewing of the base image. Also as can be seen in squares e.g. any of the multiple nested squares of the finder and alignment patterns may have rounded corners. In one or more embodiments combining of the QR code image and the base image may be implemented using alpha compositing with the transparency values used as opacity and intensity inputs for an alpha compositing process.

In one or more embodiments the base image e.g. base image seen in or base image seen in may appear to form the background of the resulting combined QR code base image e.g. combined QR code base image or combined QR code base image and the generated QR code image e.g. QR code image or QR code image may appear to form the foreground.

The resulting combined QR code base image e.g. image see may be perceived as a double image with the base image e.g. image being in the background and the generated QR code image e.g. image being in the foreground with enough transparency to be able to see the background base image.

The generated QR code image may be transparent and various regions of the generated QR code image can have different transparency values. Also various squares e.g. squares comprising modules of finder and alignment patterns of the generated QR code image can have rounded corners as may be seen in .

At process method may include operations for generating a QR code image from a string of data including inputting the data string inputting a module size e.g. number of pixels per side of each module inputting an inner portion proportion and inputting transparency values for various regions each region having specific modules of the QR code being allocated to it of the resulting QR code image to be generated inputting roundness values and choosing default values for values that have not been input. The resulting QR code image may be divided for example into four regions a the finder and alignment patterns after their squares have been rounded e.g. modified finder and alignment patterns b modules along the perimeter of the QR code image that are not in the unmodified finder and alignment patterns e.g. the quiet zone shown in c inner portions of modules that are not in the unmodified finder and alignment patterns and that are not along the perimeter quiet zone of the QR code image and d the remaining areas which may include for example outer shell portions of modules that are not in the unmodified finder and alignment patterns and that are not along the perimeter quiet zone of the QR code image and portions of the unmodified finder and alignment patterns that are not in the modified finder and alignment patterns.

The various inputs may have various respective default values. For example the module size the size e.g. length in pixels of each module of the generated QR code may have a default value of 10. The inner portion proportion as described with reference to may range between 0 and 1 and may have a default value of 0.4. Transparency values for regions a b c and d may be denoted as alpha 1 alpha 2 alpha 3 and alpha 4 respectively and each transparency value may be chosen from a range between 0 and 1. Alpha 1 for region a may have a default transparency value of 0.6 alpha 2 for region b may have a default transparency value of 0.0 alpha 3 for region c may have a default transparency value of 0.4 and alpha 4 for region d may have a default transparency value of 0.0. The roundness value as described with reference to may range between 0 and 1 and may have a default value of 0.25.

At process method may include operations for generating a QR code image from a string of data including determining the least QR coding version which can encode e.g. contain the entire information of the data string and generating the QR code image with an optimal e.g. highest possible error correction level with the squares in the finder and alignment patterns region a getting rounded corners and the regions a b c and d getting their respective transparencies. The version of the QR code to be generated may be determined as the least version which can hold the string of data. The QR code image may be generated with the highest error correction level possible for the chosen version with squares in the finder and alignment patterns getting rounded corners and with regions a b c and d getting their respective transparency values.

At process method may include operations for overlaying a generated QR code image on a base image including inputting a base image the image that will become the background of the resulting QR code overlaid image inputting the generated QR code image resulting from processes inputting a reference position defined to be the pixel coordinates in the base image at which to place the upper left corner of the generated QR code image and which may default to pixel coordinates 0 0 and inputting a size of a bounding square which has the reference position as the pixel coordinates of the bounding square s upper left corner. The generated QR code image may be placed in the bounding square as foreground.

The default size of the bounding square may be for example a size that allows the largest square that fits in the base image to be placed at the reference position. If the generated QR code image resulting from processes has a different size than the size of the bounding square the generated QR code image may before it is overlaid on the base image be resealed to the size of the bounding square.

At process method may include operations for overlaying a generated QR code image on a base image including overlaying the generated QR code image or resealed generated QR code image that fits within the bounding square with its upper left corner at the reference position on the base image. For example the overlaying may be accomplished by alpha compositing the generated QR code image with the base image.
