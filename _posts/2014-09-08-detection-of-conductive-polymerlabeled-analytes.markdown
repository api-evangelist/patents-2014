Bacterial infections are a major source of human disease and fatalities. Dangerous bacterial pathogens may be present in nearly any environment and are imperceptible to the human senses. O157 H7 for example is a common food and water borne pathogen which can cause illness and death with a dose as low as 10 cells. the causative agent of the severe and fatal disease anthrax is a likely organism for use in bioterrorism due to its low infectious dose and ability to withstand harsh conditions. The traditional method of identifying such pathogens involves culturing unknown cells in a controlled laboratory setting until colonies are visibly detectable which requires anywhere from 24 hours to several months depending on the species.

All patents patent applications government publications government regulations and literature references cited in this specification are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. In case of conflict the present description including definitions will control.

Additional features of the disclosure may become apparent to those skilled in the art from a review of the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the examples drawings and appended claims with the understanding that the disclosure is intended to be illustrative and is not intended to limit the claims to the specific embodiments described and illustrated herein.

While the disclosed compositions kits apparatus and methods are susceptible of embodiments in various forms specific embodiments of the disclosure are illustrated in the drawings and will hereafter be described with the understanding that the disclosure is intended to be illustrative and is not intended to limit the claims to the specific embodiments described and illustrated herein.

The disclosure relates to the detection of analytes e.g. biological pathogens such as bacteria or viruses using a conductive polymer label. In a specific example described herein a two particle detection system includes immunofunctionalized conductive polymer nanoparticles as labels and immunofunctionalized magnetic nanoparticles as separators concentrators each being capable of specifically binding to a desired target analyte. Representative nanoparticles can be synthesized from gamma iron oxide templates and electrically active polymers such as polyaniline.

The disclosed detection system utilizing the conductive polymer label generally involves the formation of an analyte conjugate between the target analyte and a conductive polymer moiety conjugated to the target analyte. The conductive polymer portion of the analyte conjugate is electrically activated to form an electrically activated analyte conjugate having an increased electrical conductivity relative to the analyte conjugate as originally formed e.g. by contacting the conductive polymer label with the target analyte in an aqueous sample medium . The electrically activated analyte conjugate e.g. the electrically re activated conductive polymer label thereof can then be detected by any suitable means such as by conductimetric or electrochemical detection e.g. cyclic voltammetry to detect the conductive polymer moiety of the electrically activated analyte conjugate .

In the case illustrated in the capture probe and the conductive polymer label have respective antibodies as specific binding pair members that specifically bind to regions of the target analyte e.g. different portions active sites of a bacterium thus forming a triplex between the capture probe the target analyte and the label as the analyte conjugate . The conjugates thus formed are separated from other non target sample components and unreacted target analytes by magnetic separation of the unbound capture probe nanoparticles and the bound capture probe nanoparticles in the analyte conjugate e.g. by magnetic immobilization of the nanoparticles combined with washing of the non immobilized sample medium and sample components . Subsequently the analyte conjugates are added to the surface of a biosensor e.g. illustrated as a working electrode of a screen printed carbon electrode SPCE biosensor . The target analytes can be detected on the biosensor surface through the redox properties of the conductive polymer label for example using cyclic voltammetry to detect the presence of the conjugates triplexes based on the conductive properties of the conductive polymer therein.

Prior to detecting the analyte conjugate the conductive polymer component thereof is suitably electrically activated. Conductive polymers are suitably acid doped electrically activated when initially formed. However samples to be analyzed for the presence of the target analyte can be buffered or otherwise at a generally neutral pH when the conjugate is formed. For example the analyte conjugate is generally formed in a liquid aqueous medium having a pH value of 5 or more e.g. more generally a sample medium being non acidic approximately neutral or having a physiological pH value for example a medium with a pH value at least 5 6 or 7 and or up to 8 or 9 such as a liquid aqueous sample medium including pH buffer components in which a sample containing the target analyte is incubated to form the analyte conjugate with the conductive polymer moiety . In such an environment the conductive polymer component of the conjugate may become relatively electrically de activated e.g. having an electrical conductivity less than when originally formed synthesized . Electrical re activation forms an electrically activated analyte conjugate having an increased electrical conductivity relative to the conjugate as originally formed e.g. where the electrical conductivity of the conductive polymer as originally formed from a sample can be reduced during sample capture extraction and concentration steps . Suitable methods for re activation include acid doping the analyte conjugate such as by contacting it with a strong acid e.g. a mineral acid such as HCl HNO HSO or a weak acid. Electrical re activation can be performed before application of the conjugate to the biosensor e.g. in the liquid medium where the conjugate was formed or after application of the conjugate to the biosensor .

The analyte conjugate may be immobilized on the biosensor surface prior to detection. For example the conjugate may be immobilized on a detection surface and between opposing electrodes of an electrochemical biosensor device or immobilized on a working electrode and adjacent a counter reference electrode of an electrochemical biosensor. In some embodiments the immobilization surface may be modified functionalized with a specific or non specific binding pair member for anchoring the conjugate thereto by specific or non specific binding interactions e.g. with the target analyte or other component of the conjugate . After a short incubation period the biosensor surface is washed to remove excess capture probes e.g. which have no conductive polymer label and or target analyte bound thereto and unbound conjugates e.g. which may not have had sufficient contact with the biosensor surface for attachment immobilization . In other embodiments immobilization of the conjugate may be additionally or alternatively performed using a magnet positioned below the immobilization surface of the biosensor . Application of a magnetic field with the magnet immobilizes the conjugate and pulls it tightly against the immobilization surface to enhance a subsequent conductimetric or electrochemical measurement. In this case capture probes that are unbound to other constituents may be retained on the biosensor however the absence of a corresponding conductive polymer label in the conjugate prevents the unbound capture probes from contributing to a false positive result. In some embodiments the biosensor is not functionalized with a specific or non specific binding pair member immobilization agent for example where the magnet is the only means for conjugate immobilization.

Suitable nanoparticle compositions according to the disclosure are illustrated in . A two particle detection system includes a magnetic nanoparticle capture probe and a conductive polymer nanoparticle probe label . A single particle detection system includes a combined capture probe label including a conductive polymer bound to magnetic nanoparticles e.g. a population of magnetic nanoparticles in which each nanoparticle generally has at least some conductive polymer bound thereto such as a magnetic nanoparticle core with a conductive polymer shell . The probes labels according to the disclosure include binding pair members for binding to the target analyte. U.S. Publication No. 2009 0123939 the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference discloses particulate compositions biologically enhanced particulate compositions and related methods suitable for use according to the present disclosure.

The conductive properties of the conductive polymer sometimes referenced as a synthetic metal arise from the m electron backbone and the single double bonds of the m conjugated system alternating down the polymer chain. Some conducting polymeric structures include polyaniline PANi polypyrrole polyacetylene and polyphenylene. Polyaniline in particular has been studied thoroughly because of its stability in fluid form conductive properties and strong bio molecular interactions. Conductive polymers can be used in a biosensor an analytical device capable of pathogen detection in which the conductive polymers act as electrochemical transducers to transform biological signals to electric signals that can be detected and quantified.

The conductive polymers according to the disclosure are not particularly limited and generally include any polymer that is electrically conductive. Preferably the conductive polymer is fluid mobile when bound to an analyte. Suitable examples of conductive polymers are polyanilines polypyrrole and polythiophenes which are dispersible in water and are conductive because of the presence of an anion or cation in the polymer e.g. resulting from acid doping of the polymer or monomer . Other electrically conductive polymers include substituted and unsubstituted polyanilines polyparaphenylenes polyparaphenylene vinylenes polythiophenes polypyrroles polyfurans polyselenophenes polyisothianapthenes polyphenylene sulfides polyacetylenes polypyridyl vinylenes biomaterials biopolymers conductive carbohydrates conductive polysaccharides combinations thereof and blends thereof with other polymers copolymers of the monomers thereof. Conductive polyanilines are preferred. Polyaniline is perhaps the most studied conducting polymer in a family that includes polypyrrole polyacetylene and polythiophene. As both electrical conductor and organic compound polyaniline possesses flexibility robustness highly controllable chemical and electrical properties simple synthesis low cost efficient electronic charge transfer and environmental stability. Addition of a protic solvent such as hydrochloric acid yields a conducting form of polyaniline with an increase in conductivity of up to ten orders of magnitude. Illustrative are the conductive polymers described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 333 425 6 333 145 6 331 356 and 6 315 926. Preferably the conductive polymers do not contain metals in their metallic form.

The conductive polymer provides a substrate for the subsequent attachment of a binding pair member e.g. an antibody or an oligonucleotide bound thereto which binding pair member is complementary to a target analyte and thereby forms a nanoparticle capture probe or label as described below. The electrically conductive characteristics of the conductive polymer also can facilitate detection of an analyte bound to the conductive polymer nanoparticle for example by measuring the electrical resistance or conductance through a plurality of conductive polymer nanoparticles immobilized in a capture region of conductimetric biosensor device.

The magnetic nanoparticles according to the disclosure are not particularly limited and generally include any nano sized particles e.g. about 1 nm to about 1000 nm that can be magnetized with an external magnetic electrical field. The magnetic nanoparticles more particularly include superparamagnetic particles which particles can be easily magnetized with an external magnetic field e.g. to facilitate separation or concentration of the particles from the bulk of a sample medium and then redispersed immediately once the magnet is removed e.g. in a new concentrated sample medium . Thus the magnetic nanoparticles are generally separable from solution with a conventional magnet. Suitable magnetic nanoparticles are provided as magnetic fluids or ferrofluids and mainly include nano sized iron oxide particles FeO magnetite or FeO maghemite suspended in a carrier liquid. Such magnetic nanoparticles can be prepared by superparamagnetic iron oxide by precipitation of ferric and ferrous salts in the presence of sodium hydroxide and subsequent washing with water. A suitable source of FeOis Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. which is available as a nano powder having particles sized at 

More generally the magnetic nanoparticles can include ferromagnetic nanoparticles i.e. iron containing particles providing electrical conduction or resistance . Suitable ferromagnetic nanoparticles include iron containing magnetic metal oxides for example those including iron either as Fe II Fe III or a mixture of Fe II Fe III . Non limiting examples of such oxides include FeO FeO maghemite and FeO magnetite . The magnetic nanoparticles can also be a mixed metal oxide of the type M1M2O wherein M1 represents a divalent metal ion and M2 represents a trivalent metal ion. For example the magnetic nanoparticles may be magnetic ferrites of the formula M1 FeO wherein M1 represents a divalent ion selected from Mn Co Ni Cu Zn or Ba pure or in admixture with each other or in admixture with ferrous ions. Other metal oxides include aluminium oxide chromium oxide copper oxide manganese oxide lead oxide tin oxide titanium oxide zinc oxide and zirconium oxide and suitable metals include Fe Cr Ni or magnetic alloys.

The various particulate compositions can be generally formed by the polymerization of a conductive polymer monomer e.g. aniline pyrrole in a solution e.g. aqueous either containing the magnetic nanoparticles e.g. to form a combined core shell magnetic nanoparticle with the conductive polymer or without the magnetic nanoparticles e.g. to form a nanoparticle from the conductive polymer alone . The polymerization solution generally includes an acid dopant e.g. HCl to impart electrical conductivity to the resulting polymer. The polymerization reaction is preferably initiated by the addition of an oxidant e.g. ammonium persulfate . Upon completion of the polymerization reaction the solution contains the particulate composition in which the resulting conductive polymer is bound to the magnetic nanoparticles or in the form of nanoparticles itself. The magnetic nanoparticles and the conductive polymer monomer can be combined in any suitable weight ratio in the polymerization solution so that the resulting particulate composition has a desired balance of magnetic electrical and particle size properties. For example the weight ratio of monomer magnetic nanoparticles in the polymerization solution or conductive polymer magnetic nanoparticles in the resulting particulate composition preferably ranges from about 0.01 to about 10 more preferably from about 0.1 to about 1 or about 0.4 to about 0.8 for example about 0.6. Similarly the particulate composition preferably ranges in size e.g. average size or size distribution range from about 1 nm to about 500 nm more preferably about 10 nm to about 200 nm or about 50 nm or 80 nm to about 100 nm or 120 nm for example at least about 1 nm 10 nm 20 nm or 50 nm and or up to about 50 nm 80 nm 100 nm 120 nm or 200 nm e.g. for either the conductive polymer nanoparticle or the combined magnetic nanoparticle with conductive polymer shell .

The particulate composition in any of its above embodiments can be extended to a biologically enhanced nanoparticle composition by further including a binding pair member e.g. specific binding pair member bound to the conductive polymer of the particulate composition. The binding pair member is selected to be complementary to a target analyte so that the biologically enhanced nanoparticle composition can be used for the selective detection of the target analyte in a sample.

An analyte or target analyte generally includes a chemical or biological material including living cells in a sample which is to be detected using the biologically enhanced nanoparticle composition or other analyte probe. The analyte can include pathogens of interest e.g. bacterial pathogens such as O157 H7 in addition to those listed above . The analyte also may be an antigen an antibody a ligand i.e. an organic compound for which a receptor naturally exists or can be prepared for example one that is mono or polyepitopic antigenic or haptenic a single compound or plurality of compounds that share at least one common epitopic site and a receptor i.e. a compound capable of binding to an epitopic or determinant site of a ligand for example thyroxine binding globulin antibodies enzymes Fab fragments lectins nucleic acids protein A complement component C1q . In some embodiments the term analyte also can include an analog of the analyte i.e. a modified form of the analyte which can compete with the analyte for a receptor that can also be detected using the biologically enhanced nanoparticle composition.

A sample generally includes an aliquot of any matter containing or suspected of containing the target analyte. For example samples can include biological samples such as samples from taken from animals e.g. saliva whole blood serum plasma urine tears milk and the like cell cultures plants environmental samples e.g. water industrial samples and food samples e.g. solid or liquid foods in raw or processed form such as milk . Samples may be required to be prepared prior to analysis according to the disclosed methods. For example samples may require extraction dilution filtration centrifugation and or stabilization prior to analysis. For the purposes herein sample can refer to either a raw sample as originally collected or a sample resulting from one or more preparation techniques applied to the raw sample. Accordingly a sample to be tested by contact with an analyte probe can be a liquid medium containing the analyte where the liquid medium can be the raw sample to be tested e.g. milk or it can be a liquid medium e.g. a buffer to which a solid or liquid raw sample to be tested is added.

The specific binding pair member generally includes one of two different molecules each having a region or area on its surface or in a cavity that specifically binds to i.e. is complementary with a particular spatial and polar organization of the other molecule. The binding pair members can be referenced as a ligand receptor or antiligand pair. These binding pair members include members of an immunological pair such as antigen antibody. Other specific binding pairs such as biotin avidin or derivatives thereof such as streptavidin or neutravidin hormones hormone receptors IgG protein A polynucleotide pairs e.g. DNA DNA DNA RNA DNA aptamers and whole cells are not immunological pairs but can be used as binding pair members within the context of the present disclosure.

Preferably the binding pair members are specific to each other and are selected such that one binding pair member is the target analyte of interest or a component thereof e.g. a specific surface protein or other surface component of specific bacteria or other pathogen of interest and the other binding pair member is the constituent bound to the conductive polymer of the particulate composition. Binding specificity or specific binding refers to the substantial recognition of a first molecule for a second molecule i.e. the first and second members of the binding pair for example a polypeptide and a polyclonal or monoclonal antibody an antibody fragment e.g. a Fv single chain Fv Fab or F ab fragment specific for the polypeptide enzyme substrate interactions and polynucleotide hybridization interactions. Preferably the binding pair members exhibit a substantial degree of binding specificity and do not exhibit a substantial amount of non specific binding i.e. non covalent binding between molecules that is relatively independent of the specific structures of the molecules for example resulting from factors including electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between molecules .

Substantial binding specificity refers to an amount of specific binding or recognition between molecules in an assay mixture under particular assay conditions. Substantial binding specificity relates to the extent that the first and second members of the binding pair to bind only with each other and do not bind to other interfering molecules that may be present in the analytical sample. The specificity of the first and second binding pair members for each other as compared to potential interfering molecules should be sufficient to allow a meaningful assay to be conducted for the target analyte. The substantial binding specificity can be a function of a particular set of assay conditions which includes the relative concentrations of the molecules the time and temperature of an incubation etc. For example the reactivity of one binding pair member with an interfering molecule as compared to that with the second binding pair member is preferably less than about 25 more preferably less than about 10 or about 5 .

A preferred binding pair member is an antibody an immunoglobulin that specifically binds to and is thereby defined as complementary with a particular spatial and polar organization of another molecule e.g. an antigen . Antibodies generally include Y shaped proteins on the surface of B cells that specifically bind to antigens such as bacteria viruses etc. The antibody can be monoclonal or polyclonal and can be prepared by techniques that are well known in the art such as immunization of a host and collection of sera polyclonal or by preparing continuous hybrid cell lines and collecting the secreted protein monoclonal or by cloning and expressing nucleotide sequences or mutagenized versions thereof coding at least for the amino acid sequences required for specific binding of natural antibodies. Antibodies may include a complete immunoglobulin or fragment thereof which immunoglobulins include the various classes and isotypes such as IgA IgD IgE IgG1 IgG2a IgG2b IgG3 IgM etc. Fragments thereof may include Fab Fv and F ab and Fab . In addition aggregates polymers and conjugates of immunoglobulins or their fragments can be used where appropriate so long as binding affinity for a particular molecule is maintained.

The specific binding pair member that is specific to the target analyte can be bound directly or indirectly to the conductive polymer of the particulate composition or to the detection moiety of the analyte probe more generally by any of a variety of methods known in the art appropriate for the particular binding pair member e.g. antibody DNA oligonucleotide . For example antibodies can be bound e.g. by direct physical adsorption to the conductive polymer of the particulate composition by incubating the antibodies in a buffer e.g. a phosphate buffer at a pH of about 7.4 containing dimethylformamide and lithium chloride suspension of the particulate composition. Alternatively the particulate composition can be first incubated in the presence of a suitable linker e.g. glutaraldehyde followed by incubation of the linker functionalized particulate composition with the antibodies to bind the antibodies thereto e.g. glutaraldehyde can form a link between the antibodies and the particulate composition such as the conductive polymer component thereof . For example an immunoglobulin with an Fc region and an antigen binding region capable of specifically binding to the target analyte e.g. IgA IgD IgE IgG IgM subclasses thereof and combinations thereof can be incubated with a immunoglobulin binding protein having a binding affinity to the Fc region of the immunoglobulin e.g. a bacterial surface protein such as protein A protein G protein A G and combinations thereof such that the immunoglobulin binding protein binds to the conductive polymer e.g. via adsorption and the Fc region of the immunoglobulin thereby preferentially orienting the resulting immunoconjugate so that the antigen binding region of the immunoglobulin is outwardly directed relative to the conductive polymer and the magnetic nanoparticle of the particulate composition e.g. which enhances binding capture efficiency of the immunoglobulin . Similarly oligonucleotides can be incubated in a buffer e.g. an acetate buffer at a pH of about 5.2 suspension of the particulate composition that also includes an immunoconjugating agent e.g. 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride EDAC . After a suitable incubation period i.e. depending on the rate of binding between the binding pair member and the conductive polymer the resulting biologically enhanced nanoparticles can be blocked washed centrifuged and then stored as a suspension e.g. in aqueous LiCl for an antibody on a phosphate buffered saline PBS solution for an oligonucleotide .

The detection system for capturing and identifying a target analyte in a sample can include a biosensor device incorporating a magnet for analyte conjugate triplex immobilization. As illustrated in the biosensor can include a magnet positioned below the immobilization surface of the biosensor . When the analyte conjugate includes a magnetic moiety e.g. separate from or combined with the conductive polymer label application of a magnetic field with the magnet immobilizes the conjugate and pulls it tightly against the immobilization surface to enhance a subsequent conductimetric or electrochemical measurement.

The specific type of biosensor is not particularly limited and generally includes devices known and used for the detection of an analyte by combining a biological component e.g. biological material such as tissue microorganisms organelles cell receptors enzymes antibodies nucleic acids probe DNA biomimic etc. with a physicochemical transducer element e.g. an element that works in a physicochemical way optical electrical piezoelectric electrochemical etc. that transforms the signal resulting from the interaction of the analyte with the biological element into another signal i.e. transducers that can be measured and quantified. In some embodiments the transducers act as a means for amplifying a low number or low concentration of analytes in a sample into a detectable and repeatable meaningful signal.

As described above the analyte conjugate can be detected once immobilized on an electrode surface of a SPCE biosensor . Any suitable biosensor platform may be used however. For example a sample containing the conjugate can be applied to a capture region of a lateral flow assay device where the capture region includes a means for immobilizing the conjugate e.g. a magnet mounted thereunder and or an adsorbed specific or non specific binding pair member in the capture region . The sample can be applied to the capture region in a variety of ways such as by direct addition thereto or by capillary transport of the sample from an application region to the capture region. The presence of the target analyte in the sample can be determined e.g. and optionally quantified by magnetically or conductimetrically detecting the analyte conjugate e.g. by detecting the magnetic nanoparticle or conductive polymer component thereof in the capture region.

As generally illustrated in and described above the biosensor the magnetic capture probe the conductive polymer label and or the combined capture probe label of any of the above embodiments can be used in an assay to detect the presence of the target analyte in the sample e.g. which can contain the target analyte of interest as well as non target components . Specific detection of the target analyte is effected using binding pair members selected to be complementary to the target analyte . The probes labels can be independently provided in a variety of forms for example a liquid suspension a powder or as part of an assay device e.g. in an application region of a lateral flow assay device .

The probes labels are contacted with the sample for a time sufficient to bind any target analyte in the sample to the binding pair members thereby forming an analyte conjugate . The sample and probes labels can be contacted in any convenient way for example by combining the components in a reaction vessel e.g. together or in series . The contact time required to obtain sufficient binding between the target analyte and the binding pair member generally depends on the kinetics of the particular analyte binding pair member interaction e.g. at least 1 2 5 or 10 minutes and or up to 30 60 90 or 120 minutes .

A magnetic field can be applied to the sample e.g. using a magnet to concentrate the analyte conjugate using an immunomagnetic separation process. Specifically the applied magnetic field attracts the magnetic portion of the analyte conjugate causing individual particles of the conjugate to migrate to and concentrate in a region of the assay reaction vessel. Thus after migration of the conjugate a portion of the sample that is substantially free from the conjugate can be removed e.g. by draining skimming pipetting washing etc. thereby forming a sample concentrate that contains substantially all of conjugate . The sample concentrate can include some free probes labels that are not conjugated to a target analyte .

The analyte conjugate is then applied to the detection surface of the biosensor e.g. and optionally immobilized thereon as described above . In the illustrated SPCE biosensor the conjugate can be applied directly to the detection surface e.g. by pipetting a liquid suspension of the conjugate such as that resulting from an immunomagnetic separation process . Prior to detection of the analyte conjugate e.g. via the conductive polymer component thereof the analyte conjugate is suitable electrically re activated and the detection surface having the triplex immobilized thereon is suitably washed e.g. by rinsing with DI water or other suitable wash fluid such as one containing an electrically activating acid dopant . Washing can be performed during the application of a magnetic field via the magnet to remove non magnetically attractable components conjugates from the biosensor detection surface . Washing enhances the qualitative and quantitative accuracy of the assay because it provides a means to eliminate free probes and or labels on the detection surface that are not bound to any target analyte but which could otherwise be detectable and contribute to a false positive or positively biased concentration due to the presence of the conductive polymer .

The biosensor is then used to detect the presence of the immobilized analyte conjugate such as via the conductive polymer component thereof. A positive identification of the conjugate in the sample concentrate applied to the detection surface indicates the presence of the target analyte in the original sample . If a quantitative determination of the conjugate is made any dilution and concentration factors can be used to determine the concentration of the target analyte in the original sample . The specific method of detection of the analyte nanoparticle complex is not particularly limiting and can include methods applicable to immunoassays in general or immunomagnetic assays in particular e.g. agglomeration spectrophotometric detection colorimetric detection radioactive detection visual inspection . In the method illustrated in the figures and examples the electrically conductive polymer component of the conjugate can be conductimetrically or electrochemically detected e.g. by conducting cyclic voltammetry to detect the conductive polymer moiety of the electrically activated analyte conjugate .

The disclosed compositions also can be provided in a kit. A suitable kit includes one or more of a probe label specific to a desired target analyte optionally and a biosensor e.g. including the magnet for immobilization . In an embodiment the kit can be intended to be used for multiplexed analysis of several different target analytes such that it contains a plurality of different probe label pairs where each analyte probe label pair has specific binding pair members capable of specifically binding to a different target analyte . The kit can include one or a plurality of biosensors . The kit can generally include a variety of other optional components that may be desired and or appropriate for example a reaction vessel e.g. a container for mixing the probes labels and a sample to be analyzed a magnet wash reagents detector reagents positive and or negative control reagents assay kit instructions according to any of the methods disclosed herein and other additives e.g. stabilizers buffers . The relative amounts of the various reagents may be varied widely to provide for concentrations in solution of the reagents that substantially optimize the sensitivity of the assay. Particularly the reagents may be provided as dry powders e.g. lyophilized which on dissolution will provide for a reagent solution having the appropriate concentrations for combining with the sample .

The following example illustrates various compositions apparatus and methods according to the disclosure for detecting target analytes such as bacterial pathogens but are not intended to limit the scope of the claims appended hereto.

In this example O157 H7 cells are isolated via immunomagnetic separation IMS and labeled with biofunctionalized electroactive polyaniline immuno PANI . Labeled cell complexes are deposited onto a disposable screen printed carbon electrode SPCE sensor and pulled to the electrode surface by an external magnetic field to amplify the electrochemical signal generated by the polyaniline. Cyclic voltammetry is used to detect polyaniline and signal magnitude indicates the presence or absence of O157 H7. As few as 7 CFU of O157 H7 corresponding to an original concentration of 70 CFU ml were successfully detected on the SPCE sensor. The assay requires 70 min from sampling to detection giving it a major advantage over standard culture methods in applications requiring high throughput screening of samples and rapid results. The method can be performed with portable handheld instrumentation and no biological modification of the sensor surface is required.

A PalmSens handheld potentiostat with PSLITE software PalmSens Houten Netherlands and a VersaStat II potentiostat with POWERCV software Princeton Applied Research MA were used.

Polyaniline nanostructures nano PANI were synthesized by chemical oxidative polymerization in micellar solution. Briefly 0.043 M aniline monomer was dispersed in 0.1 M HCl containing approximately 0.2 M SDS. Ammonium persulfate APS dissolved in 0.1 M HCl was added dropwise such that aniline APS ratio 2. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 90 min and changed from colorless to dark green indicating formation of conductive polyaniline emeraldine salt. Methanol was added to quench polymerization. Polyaniline precipitate was collected by centrifugation washed in 50 methanol and finally suspended in phosphate buffer containing 0.05 TRITON X 100. Very brief 1 2 s centrifugation was performed to precipitate only the largest polyaniline particulates. The supernatant consisting of bright green well dispersed polyaniline nanostructures was reserved and used for further experiments. The size and morphology of the nano PANI were characterized using a 200 kV field emission transmission electron microscope JEOL 2200 FS . The electrical conductivity of nano PANI in solution was measured using an ACCUMET BASIC AB30 conductivity meter Fisher Scientific .

Monoclonal anti O157 H7 antibodies were coated onto nano PANI by direct physical adsorption. Antibodies 0.1 mg ml final concentration were added to nano PANI suspended in phosphate buffer containing 0.05 TRITON X 100 and hybridized for 1 h. Following adsorption of antibody the bio modified polyaniline immunoPANI was centrifuged 3 min at 10 000 rpm to remove unbound antibodies washed twice with blocking buffer 0.1 w v casein to block unoccupied reactive sites on polyaniline and finally resuspended in phosphate buffer containing 0.05 TRITON X 100 and stored at 4 C. A Shimadzu UV 3101 PC spectrophotometer was used to compare protein content absorbance at 280 nm of the antibody solution before and after incubation with nano PANI in order to confirm hybridization between antibodies and nano PANI.

Immuno PANI was added to the immunomagnetically captured O157 H7 IMB solutions at 10 v v and hybridized for 30 min. IMB immuno PANI complexes were magnetically separated from unbound immuno PANI washed twice in PBS containing 0.05 TRITON X 100 and finally resuspended in PBS. Polyaniline labeling of immunomagnetically captured O157 H7 cells is depicted in .

The IMB Immuno PANI complexes were magnetically separated and suspended in 0.1 M HCl for 10 min in order to electrically activate the polyaniline by acid doping. The volume of acid in which complexes were suspended was half of the original solution volume so that the concentration of IMB immuno PANI complexes was doubled prior to detection. Immediately following the incubation period a volume of 100 l of IMB immunoPANI in 0.1 M HCl was added to the sample well of the SPCE sensor and the sensor was placed on a magnetic field in order to attract and position the complexes tightly onto the sensor surface to amplify the electrochemical signal generated by the polyaniline. The SPCE sensor was connected to the potentiostat galvanostat and a voltammetric cycle between 1.0 V and 0.4V was applied at a scan rate of 100 mV s. Each sensor was scanned with four complete consecutive cycles and for each cycle the response current data was recorded.

Successful immunomagnetic extraction of O157 H7 was confirmed by microbial plating of the IMB immuno PANI solutions. Percent capture efficiency was calculated as captured viable cell concentration original viable cell concentration 100. The concentration of captured viable cells CFU ml was also used to estimate the actual number of cells present in the 100 l sample which was deposited onto the SPCE. For four different concentrations of O157 H7 blank 10 10 and 10CFU ml Table 1 shows the original and captured cell concentrations the capture efficiency the absolute number of cells present on the SPCE during detection and the minimum electrical current signal obtained during detection. Reported values are the mean of three identical trials one standard deviation.

The capture efficiencies attained 40 50 are comparable to other published bacterial capture studies using this brand of commercial IMBs. The minimum current signals displayed in the last column of Table 1 demonstrate that the electrochemical detection results agree with microbial plating results increasing cell concentration corresponds to increasing absolute value of current signal .

Nano PANI investigated by transmission electron microscopy consists of spherical particles less than 50 nm in diameter and clusters of particles ranging in size from approximately 100 to 300 nm. The nano PANI solution is a bright green color indicating that it is the conductive emeraldine salt form of polyaniline which results from the acid doping polymerization method employed here. Polyaniline has well characterized pH induced redox reversibility meaning that in neutral or basic conditions loss of electroactivity will occur. The electrical conductivities of nano PANI suspended in DI water and in 0.1 M HCl were determined to be 0.4 mS cm and 26.4 mS cm respectively. Both solutions contained 0.1 v v TRITON X 100 to keep nano PANI well dispersed during measurement. The conductivity of nano PANI is significantly increased in the presence of hydrochloric acid as a dopant relative to non doped nano PANI in neutral DI water . To ensure maximum electroactivity of the polyaniline label used in this assay the IMB immuno PANI complexes were re doped in 0.1 M HCl for 10 min immediately prior to electrochemical detection.

Immunofunctionalization of nano PANI was carried out by physical adsorption of antibodies onto the polyaniline surface. Electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged Fc portion of the antibodies and the positively charged polymer are thought to play a role in adsorption and orientation of the biomolecules. Successful conjugation of antibodies onto nano PANI was confirmed by measuring the absorbance of the antibody solution at 280 nm an indicator of protein content. The measured absorbance of the conjugation supernatant was lower than that of the original antibody solution demonstrating that antibodies were retained on the nano PANI during hybridization.

From each electrochemical test cyclic voltammograms plot of response current vs. applied potential were recorded for each of the four consecutive scans performed. depicts cyclic voltammograms of nano PANI immuno PANI and IMB immuno PANI solutions containing various bacterial counts. Also shown are voltammograms of IMBs O157 H7 cells and 0.1 M HCl solution alone at concentrations equivalent to those used in the IMB immuno PANI assay.

Immunofunctionalization of nano PANI masks its electroactivity to some extent as shown by the smaller magnitude and loss of peak resolution in the cyclic voltammogram of immuno PANI curve b . Specifically the second and third oxidation and corresponding reduction peaks merge into one and overall peak height decreases. Curves c e are the IMB immuno PANI complexes with bacteria counts ranging from 7 10to 7 10CFU. These curves exhibit the same shape as that of immuno PANI but are smaller in magnitude because excess immuno PANI has been removed by washing and only that which is bound to O157 H7 cells remains. Curve f the blank test has a similar shape but significantly lower magnitude. The low level of immuno PANI present in the blank test is due to non specific interaction with IMBs which prevents some of the immuno PANI from being removed during washings. This is considered as the background signal. The fact that the tests containing cells curves c e have significantly higher magnitude than the background signal demonstrates that immuno PANI is indeed specifically binding to O157 H7 cells. The remaining curves g i have very low current magnitude and no polyaniline peaks demonstrating that HCl IMBs and O157 H7 cells alone do not significantly contribute to the magnitude of the signal. The narrow spike occurring around 0.05 V arises from the HCl solution in which all the samples are suspended.

For simplicity of comparison each cyclic voltammogram plot of response current vs. applied potential can be represented by a single numeric parameter. Three parameters were evaluated for each voltammogram the quantity of charge transferred Q the maximum current value and the minimum current value. Charge transfer Q is computed as the integral of the current with respect to time. Maximum current is taken as the positive current value occurring at 0.245 V on the cyclic voltammogram approximate location of the highest oxidation peak . Minimum current is taken as the negative current value occurring at 0.420 V on the cyclic voltammogram approximate location of the lowest reduction peak .

All the three sensor response parameters Q maximum current and minimum current are strongly linear across the three cell concentrations tested. Each of the regression coefficients R are greater than 0.96. Logarithmic regression equations are displayed in the figure. A single factor ANOVA test indicated that the Q values obtained for each cell count 7 10 6 10 7 10 and 0 CFU are statistically different from one another with 99 confidence. The same result was obtained for maximum and minimum current values.

The strong linear trend observed in in which all the data was collected in a single experiment indicates a linear dynamic range of 7 10to 7 10CFU 7 10to 7 10CFU ml . However the linearity of the sensor response disappears when data from several different experiments are pooled . Without linearity the sensor is still useful in providing a qualitative positive negative result. If quantitative results are desired a new calibration curve must be constructed for each experiment in which unknown samples are tested. Even so the biosensor s strong linearity and wide linear range within one experiment is an advantage showing that it has the potential to be developed into a fully quantitative detection method if day to day variation in signal values can be reduced. demonstrates that the biosensor results are reproducible for qualitative yes no detection because all the 20 positive tests produced signals much higher than the blank tests signal blank ratio 1.45 .

The data displayed in indicate that as few as 7 CFU of O157 H7 present on the SPCE sensor corresponding to an original cell concentration of 70 CFU ml can be detected with signal blank ratio 1.5 the signal blank ratios at this cell count are 1.67 1.74 and 2.05 . Slightly lower signal blank ratios are observed at higher cell counts 1.45 and 1.50 at 4.7 10and 2.9 10CFU respectively which may indicate a slight Hooke effect. It is important to note though that for four of the positive tests signal blank ratios were greater than 3 and even as high as 7.5. Future efforts will focus on improving the sensitivity of the sensor until signal blank ratios greater than 3 can be consistently achieved for all the positive samples.

Prior to detection the IMB immuno PANI complexes were immunomagnetically separated and resuspended in half of the original volume in order to double the concentration being applied to the SPCE sensor. This resulted in a larger amount of PANI on the sensor and consequently a stronger electrochemical signal as compared to unconcentrated test solutions data not shown . A potential way to increase the sensitivity of the system is to use larger sample volumes and immunomagnetically concentrate the test solutions by more than twofold before they are applied to the SPCE sensor.

Also prior to detection an external magnetic field was used to draw IMB immuno PANI complexes to the sensor surface where the electric field is most concentrated. Magnetically positioning the polyaniline as near as possible to the electrode is a simple way of amplifying the electrochemical signal. The presence of the magnetic field results in current values approximately five times higher than those obtained without the magnetic field. Additionally the signal blank ratio is slightly higher in the presence of the magnetic field than in its absence .

The biosensor s limit of detection 7 CFU or 70 CFU ml is lower than the infectious dose of O157 H7 10 100 cells making it a practical detection method. Table 2 compares this with other biosensors for O157 H7 which also employ IMS and some type of electrochemical detection. The detection limit of the biosensor is one order of magnitude lower than any of the detection limits of the similar methods found in the literature giving this biosensor a clear advantage.

The linear range of 7 10to 7 10CFU ml observed for this biosensor in data from a single experiment is also an advantage. As shown in Table 2 other IMS electrochemical detection methods are either not linear at all or have a smaller linear range 3 orders of magnitude than that of the example sensor 4 orders of magnitude .

This example illustrates a rapid electrochemical method for O157 H7 detection. Cells are isolated by immunomagnetic separation labeled with electroactive polyaniline and detected by cyclic voltammetry on screen printed carbon electrodes. Results show a detection limit of 7 CFU 70 CFU ml with a linear range of 10to 10CFU ml. The assay requires 70 min from sampling to result. The low detection limit and short assay time give this biosensor the potential to replace time consuming culture methods as the means of initial screening for rapid qualitative results. Another major advantage of the biosensor is its portability. No surface modification of the SPCE sensor is required making it stable for long term storage and transport. A handheld battery powered potentiostat and pocket PC make it feasible to perform this assay in the field. The biosensor could be adapted for other targets simply by use of different antibodies and immunomagnetic separation of the target can be performed in a variety of sample matrices.
