No. 6 517 433 U.S. Pat. No. 8 057 204 and U.S. Pat. No. 8 226 459 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

The gaming machine illustrated in comprises a cabinet that may house various input devices output devices and input output devices. By way of example the gaming machine includes a primary display area a secondary display area and one or more audio speakers . The primary display area or the secondary display area may be a mechanical reel display a video display or a combination thereof in which a transmissive video display is disposed in front of the mechanical reel display to portray a video image superimposed upon the mechanical reel display. The display areas may variously display information associated with wagering games non wagering games community games progressives advertisements services premium entertainment text messaging emails alerts announcements broadcast information subscription information etc. appropriate to the particular mode s of operation of the gaming machine . The gaming machine includes a touch screen s mounted over the primary or secondary areas buttons on a button panel bill validator information reader writer s and player accessible port s e.g. audio output jack for headphones video headset jack USB port wireless transmitter receiver etc. . It should be understood that numerous other peripheral devices and other elements exist and are readily utilizable in any number of combinations to create various forms of a gaming machine in accord with the present concepts.

Input devices such as the touch screen buttons a mouse a joystick a gesture sensing device a voice recognition device and a virtual input device accept player input s and transform the player input s to electronic data signals indicative of the player input s which correspond to an enabled feature for such input s at a time of activation e.g. pressing a Max Bet button or soft key to indicate a player s desire to place a maximum wager to play the wagering game . The input s once transformed into electronic data signals are output to a game logic circuitry for processing. The electronic data signals are selected from a group consisting essentially of an electrical current an electrical voltage an electrical charge an optical signal an optical element a magnetic signal and a magnetic element.

Turning now to there is shown a block diagram of one gaming machine architecture. The gaming machine includes game logic circuitry having a central processing unit CPU connected to a main memory . The CPU may include any suitable processor s such as those made by Intel and AMD. By way of example the CPU may include a plurality of microprocessors including a master processor a slave processor and a secondary or parallel processor. Game logic circuitry as used herein comprises any combination of hardware software or firmware disposed in or outside of the gaming machine that is configured to communicate with or control the transfer of data between the gaming machine and a bus another computer processor device service or network. The game logic circuitry and more specifically the CPU comprises one or more controllers or processors and such one or more controllers or processors need not be disposed proximal to one another and may be located in different devices or in different locations. The game logic circuitry and more specifically the main memory comprises one or more memory devices which need not be disposed proximal to one another and may be located in different devices or in different locations. The game logic circuitry is operable to execute all of the various gaming methods and other processes disclosed herein. The main memory includes a wagering game unit . In one embodiment the wagering game unit may cause wagering games to be presented such as video poker video black jack video slots video lottery etc. in whole or part.

The game logic circuitry is also connected to an input output I O bus which can include any suitable bus technologies such as an AGTL frontside bus and a PCI backside bus. The I O bus is connected to various input devices output devices and input output devices such as those discussed above in connection with . The I O bus is also connected to a storage unit and an external system interface which may be connected to external system s e.g. wagering game networks .

The external system includes in various aspects a gaming network other gaming machines or terminals one or more gaming servers a remote controller communications hardware or a variety of other interfaced systems or components in any combination. In yet other aspects the external system may include a player s portable electronic device e.g. cellular phone electronic wallet etc. and the external system interface is configured to facilitate wireless communication and data transfer between the portable electronic device and the gaming machine such as by a near field communication path operating via magnetic field induction or a frequency hopping spread spectrum RF signals e.g. Bluetooth etc. .

The gaming machine optionally communicates with the external system such that the gaming machine operates as a thin thick or intermediate client. The game logic circuitry whether located within thick client external to thin client or distributed both within and external to intermediate client the gaming machine is utilized to provide a wagering game on the gaming machine . In general the main memory comprising one or more memory devices stores programming for a random number generator RNG service server game outcome logic and game assets e.g. art sound etc. . When a wagering game instance is executed the CPU comprising one or more processors or controllers executes the RNG programming to generate one or more pseudo random numbers. The pseudo random numbers are utilized by the CPU when executing the game outcome logic to determine a resultant outcome for that instance of the wagering game. The resultant outcome is then presented to a player of the gaming machine by accessing the associated game assets required for the resultant outcome from the main memory . The CPU causes the game assets to be presented to the player as outputs from the gaming machine e.g. audio and video presentations .

The gaming machine may include additional peripheral devices or more than one of each component shown in . Any component of the gaming machine architecture may include hardware firmware or tangible machine readable storage media including instructions for causing computing equipment to perform the operations described herein. Machine readable storage media includes any mechanism that stores information and provides the information in a form readable by a machine e.g. gaming terminal computer etc. . For example machine readable storage media includes read only memory ROM random access memory RAM magnetic disk storage media optical storage media flash memory etc.

Referring now to there is illustrated an image of a basic game screen adapted to be displayed on the primary display area or the secondary display area . The basic game screen portrays a plurality of simulated symbol bearing reels . Alternatively or additionally the basic game screen portrays a plurality of mechanical reels or other video or mechanical presentation consistent with the game format and theme. The basic game screen also advantageously displays one or more game session credit meters and various touch screen buttons adapted to be actuated by a player. A player can operate or interact with the wagering game using these touch screen buttons or other input devices such as the buttons shown in . The game logic circuitry operates to execute a wagering game program causing the primary display area or the secondary display area to display the wagering game.

In response to receiving an input indicative of a wager the reels are rotated and stopped to place symbols on the reels in visual association with paylines such as paylines . The wagering game evaluates the displayed array of symbols on the stopped reels and provides immediate awards and bonus features in accordance with a pay table. The pay table may for example include line pays or scatter pays. Line pays occur when a predetermined type and number of symbols appear along an activated payline typically in a particular order such as left to right right to left top to bottom bottom to top etc. Scatter pays occur when a predetermined type and number of symbols appear anywhere in the displayed array without regard to position or paylines. Similarly the wagering game may trigger bonus features based on one or more bonus triggering symbols appearing along an activated payline i.e. line trigger or anywhere in the displayed array i.e. scatter trigger . The wagering game may also provide mystery awards and features independent of the symbols appearing in the displayed array.

In accord with various methods of conducting a wagering game on a gaming system in accord with the present concepts the wagering game includes a game sequence in which a player makes a wager and a wagering game outcome is provided or displayed in response to the wager being received or detected. The wagering game outcome for that particular wagering game instance is then revealed to the player in due course following initiation of the wagering game. The method comprises the acts of conducting the wagering game using a gaming apparatus such as the gaming machine depicted in following receipt of an input from the player to initiate a wagering game instance. The gaming machine then communicates the wagering game outcome to the player via one or more output devices e.g. primary display or secondary display through the display of information such as but not limited to text graphics static images moving images etc. or any combination thereof. In accord with the method of conducting the wagering game the game logic circuitry transforms a physical player input such as a player s pressing of a Spin Reels touch key into an electronic data signal indicative of an instruction relating to the wagering game e.g. an electronic data signal bearing data on a wager amount .

In the aforementioned method for each data signal the game logic circuitry is configured to process the electronic data signal to interpret the data signal e.g. data signals corresponding to a wager input and to cause further actions associated with the interpretation of the signal in accord with stored instructions relating to such further actions executed by the controller. As one example the CPU causes the recording of a digital representation of the wager in one or more storage media e.g. storage unit the CPU in accord with associated stored instructions causes the changing of a state of the storage media from a first state to a second state. This change in state is for example effected by changing a magnetization pattern on a magnetically coated surface of a magnetic storage media or changing a magnetic state of a ferromagnetic surface of a magneto optical disc storage media a change in state of transistors or capacitors in a volatile or a non volatile semiconductor memory e.g. DRAM etc. The noted second state of the data storage media comprises storage in the storage media of data representing the electronic data signal from the CPU e.g. the wager in the present example . As another example the CPU further in accord with the execution of the stored instructions relating to the wagering game causes the primary display other display device or other output device e.g. speakers lights communication device etc. to change from a first state to at least a second state wherein the second state of the primary display comprises a visual representation of the physical player input e.g. an acknowledgement to a player information relating to the physical player input e.g. an indication of the wager amount a game sequence an outcome of the game sequence or any combination thereof wherein the game sequence in accord with the present concepts comprises acts described herein. The aforementioned executing of the stored instructions relating to the wagering game is further conducted in accord with a random outcome e.g. determined by the RNG Service that is used by the game logic circuitry to determine the outcome of the wagering game instance. In at least some aspects the game logic circuitry is configured to determine an outcome of the wagering game instance at least partially in response to the random parameter.

Referring to a conceptual diagram is shown according to one embodiment illustrating an example of a game system architecture . The game system architecture includes a primary gaming machine a secondary content controller a primary content server and a secondary content server which all communicate using an internal bus or via an external networking interface not shown via network .

The game system architecture may provide wagering games and wagering gaming services including wagering game content hosting and delivery financial transactions and accounting management and communications between terminals and network servers to enable distributed progressive jackpots game transaction logging distributed collaborated gaming etc. Alternatively the game system architecture may provide no wagering functionality with its gaming content or services in any capacity. Any combination of wagering and non wagering gaming and associated content and services performed by the game system architecture is possible. The specific type of game s provided by any local or remote data source in addition to any further distributed services and network available information content or gaming methodologies are all envisioned as being possible variants without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

Communication and information flow between system components using an internal bus which may include universal serial bus USB peripheral component interconnect PCI and or peripheral component interconnect express PCI E is typically much faster than communication via the network . One reason for this may include the requirement for a network interface system not shown . Another reason may involve the overhead inherent in the buffering and processing of data packets conforming to communication protocol s configured to facilitate wired or wireless communication and data transfer between various network terminals both local and remote. In one embodiment external systems may include portable electronic devices electronic wallets other gaming machines network routers or gateways providing access to other networks including wagering game networks external servers etc.

The primary gaming machine may be configured to present and control one or more games as well as other content associated with the games. As mentioned prior these games may include wagering games entertainment based games or some combination of both. The primary gaming machine includes a primary content controller one or more input components and one or more output components . The secondary content controller includes a secondary controller module a detection module and an output module .

The primary content controller is configured to control one or more content processes such as a primary game other additional game s and other content provided by a primary source of content which may include game content. For example the primary content server can provide primary game and content data to the primary content controller such as control and application data for one or more thin client applications controlled by the primary content controller . Alternatively the primary source of content may be statically stored in memory local to the primary content controller via a data bus. For example memory may include one or more of machine readable storage media includes read only memory ROM random access memory RAM magnetic disk storage media optical storage media flash memory etc.

The primary content controller may include one or more processing units and one or more associated memory devices for performing the described various operations of the primary content controller . For example the primary content controller executes game applications in addition to many if not all of the services and operations of the primary gaming machine and its components. This includes the operating system and any application programming interface API defined for the primary gaming machine as a whole. Additional services may include a RNG service server printer services card reader writer input output bill validator etc. all accessible via the API executing on the primary content controller .

The primary content controller may also include one or more dedicated mechanical reel controllers not shown which receive high level commands from a primary central processing unit within the controller and generate low level commands to control the reels via the API. Other types of the primary content controller configurations and command message exchange between various system components may be used for differing mechanical devices and components without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

The one or more input components are configured to control and or provide input for the games and other content presented via the primary gaming machine . For example the input components may include one or more touch screen displays by which a user can touch a screen and select certain virtual controls objects items etc. presented one or more of the touch screen displays. In another example the input components include a button panel with buttons related to one or more games or other applications or services. The buttons for example may indicate betting amounts payline amounts spin controls or other items used to make bets spin reels etc. for a wagering game. The buttons may also detect input related to payout mechanisms and or cashing out a wagering game such as an activation of a cash out button used to transfer credits from wagering game credit balances to a cash out object card account etc. The buttons may also accept input related to casino services and amenities. In some examples the input components include cameras audio input devices or joysticks to gather user gestures sounds and or physical interaction to generate corresponding input for a game. In yet other examples the input components include eye tracking equipment biometric devices and so forth. In some examples the input components also includes input devices related to funds player information etc. For example the primary gaming machine includes an information reader that reads information from a card or device and connects to a player account a customer loyalty account a financial account etc. In some examples the information reader can communicate with a mobile device such as a player s personal mobile device.

One or more output related components are configured to control and or present output information related to the games and the other content. For example the primary gaming machine includes one or more display devices that present wagering game content content for casino services content for advertisements and so forth. The output components further include one or more video and graphics devices or engines that generate an image of content to present via the one or more displays associated with the primary gaming machine . In another example the output components includes speakers sound cards etc. that generate and or present signals and sounds for the games and other content. In another example the output components include one or more payout mechanisms such as a printer that prints out tickets coupons etc. related to the games. For example the printer can print out a ticket that shows a cash out amount for one or more wagering games concurrently presented via the primary gaming machine . In yet another example the primary gaming machine includes various lighting devices that show information related to games such as lighting effects e.g. a celebratory effect an attract effect etc. .

The secondary controller module enables the secondary content controller to communicate with various components and operating system services of the primary gaming machine typically via the API. This enables the secondary content controller to present receive and control various aspects of independent secondary content using the output components and the input components of the primary gaming machine .

The secondary controller module may include software and hardware such as one or more processors one or more memory devices an operating system game applications etc. including memory modules comprising one or more of machine readable storage media includes read only memory ROM random access memory RAM magnetic disk storage media optical storage media flash memory etc. The secondary controller executes programmatic instructions which provide a graphical user interface which may be retrieved defined and generated in a variety of ways. In one embodiment the secondary controller requests remotely stored graphical user interface programmatic instructions for example from the primary content server and or the secondary content server and may be retrieved on demand over an arbitrary network for example a local area or Internet network using standardized industry protocols e.g. file transfer protocol FTP or hypertext transfer protocol HTTP .

The detection module unit is configured to detect information from the various devices and components of the primary gaming machine including information from the input components and the output components . For example the detection module receives the graphics data from the output components and forwards the graphics data to the secondary controller module for further processing. In one embodiment the detection module detects the graphics data e.g. graphical and video presentation data provided from a video card a graphics engine or other sources of graphics data generated by the primary gaming machine . The graphics data may include a position of primary content on a display of the primary gaming machine according to default display parameters e.g. default size of a display area default display dimensions etc. .

The output module provides modified output data to the output components of primary gaming machine . After the secondary controller module receives the secondary game and content data from the secondary content server or alternatively from local memory module s not shown adapted presentation data is generated with information indicating where to position a secondary graphical user interface. This may include specifying any positioning and details regarding a secondary game or other secondary content placement relative to the position of the primary content in a unified graphical user interface. The output module then incorporates information about the secondary content and the primary content in the modified output data so that the display device of the primary gaming machine can concurrently present both the primary and secondary content. This process may include manipulating the graphics data to move or resize the position of the primary content relative to the display parameters of the desired presentation layout. The secondary controller module then sends the adapted presentation data to the output module such as display coordinates display boundaries display sizes or other display data for the primary content that has been moved or resized to accommodate the presentation of an independent secondary game. The output module receives the adapted presentation data and provides the modified output data to the output components of the primary gaming machine . The output components use the modified output data to display the primary content and the secondary content on one or more display devices of primary gaming machine .

Further in some embodiments the detection module intercepts the user input from the input components and provides the user input to the secondary controller module . The secondary controller module receives the user input interprets the user input and in some cases modifies the user input according to the adapted presentation data generating a modified input data . The secondary controller module further provides the modified input data to the primary content controller . For instance the detection unit intercepts a touch screen input from the input components before the primary content controller can detect the touch screen input. The detection unit forwards the touch screen input to the secondary controller module . The secondary controller module converts or remaps the touch screen input to different coordinates of the touch screen display that relate to a modified location of primary content on the display as well as to secondary content presented on the display. The secondary controller module sends the modified input data to the primary content controller so that the primary content controller can control a primary game according to the modified input data . The secondary controller module further detects the primary game data generated by the primary content controller so that the secondary controller module can generate updates to the adapted presentation data .

The primary gaming machine and the secondary content controller may communicate in one or more various ways independently or simultaneously typically through calls and requests made via the API. Information may flow between the various components of primary gaming machine and the secondary content controller via a network or an internal external bus . The bus may have additional resources equipment and or memory modules connected therewith which provide or store information used by the primary gaming machine and or the secondary content controller and may be implemented internally or externally to primary gaming machine . As mentioned above memory modules may include any type of digital storage including one or more of machine readable storage media like read only memory ROM random access memory RAM magnetic disk storage media optical storage media flash memory etc. and the use of one or more of these memory types should not be construed to depart from the spirit or scope of the invention.

As a general rule most information which flows between the primary content controller and the input output components passes through the secondary content controller . This enables video output from the primary content controller to run unaltered in some or all of a portion of one or more displays of the primary gaming machine for example in an arbitrarily defined window or frame. For this reason no physical or programmed alteration of the content or primary game and content data or other primary game content of the primary gaming machine is required even in combination with any secondary processes the primary gaming machine maintains all functionality and operation enabled by the primary game and content data the primary content controller and all specified original and additional gaming non gaming programmatic display content.

In one embodiment the secondary content controller is configured to receive video input from the primary content controller directed for output on the display device s of the gaming machine. The video output generated by the primary content controller is processed by the secondary controller module and may be adjusted by compression and or displacement to make room on the display s for additional region s of the graphical user interface. Alternatively a secondary graphical user interface may be superimposed over the native video output generated by primary content controller . Any ambiguity in touch input in overlapping interactive regions of game play shown on primary secondary displays and the in use graphical user interface s is also specified. This reduces interference or confusion during the use of superimposed interfaces by determining proper handling of coordinate input information intended for game logic circuitry primary graphical interface secondary graphical user interface s or both. A secondary controller module may specifically include functional contingencies for input and output in overlapping regions in these instances including selective routing of touch input to a particular gaming process by determination of which game interface resides at a higher logical layer based on the overlaid imagery.

In one embodiment the secondary content controller instantiates a secondary graphical user interface which envelops i.e. encapsulates a primary graphical user interface generated by the primary content controller and translates coordinate input from the input components into native coordinate information relative to the primary graphical user interface. In this case it is noted that the primary graphical user interface operates as an independent subset subcomponent of the secondary graphical user interface. As a result the primary content controller and the primary graphical user interface are unaware that a secondary content controller exists and any associated secondary graphical user interface is being used in conjunction with it. The primary content controller continues to perform functions of the primary game while receiving coordinate input native to the primary graphical user interface. The received input coordinate data is interpreted as if no secondary content controller and secondary graphical user interface is being implemented.

In another embodiment the secondary content controller instantiates a secondary graphical user interface which operates independently from a primary graphical user interface generated by the primary content controller and the primary gaming machine where the two graphical user interfaces do not overlap or interact. The overall process and operation as detailed is effectively unchanged in an embodiment where the secondary content controller modifies and presents video information translates user input data and issues commands to the primary content controller using the API solely during secondary game operation control.

In one embodiment the secondary content controller uses industry standard protocols and a second network URL to retrieve load and execute programmatic instructions for the graphical user interface and any secondary games and content from a remote server e.g. secondary content server . In most instances the secondary content server is distinct from the primary content server but various other configurations and services topologies remain within the scope and spirit of the invention. The second network URL provides programmatic code to establish and execute a secondary or unified graphical user interface which interfaces with the services available to the operating system of the primary machine via the API as detailed above. In another embodiment the secondary content controller is populated with programmatic instructions at the command of the primary content server . This allows a properly authorized and authenticated i.e. trusted primary content server to control the access and loading of content information and software to the secondary content controller in a secure manner.

In one embodiment the game system architecture includes a primary gaming machine which relies on remote network servers to store and deliver gaming content upon request. The primary content controller uses a first network uniform resource locator URL to retrieve load and execute programmatic instructions for the primary game from a remote host e.g. primary content server .

The spirit and scope of the present invention includes primary gaming machine providing other types of content in addition to wagering non wagering games including additional wagering games non wagering games and or multimedia content stored locally and or remotely. These games and or content may be accessed in the same way the current game s are accessed for example through use of transferring programmatic instructions and associate data over a network via remote content servers including primary content server and secondary content server .

In some embodiments the primary content server and or the secondary content server may act as wagering game content servers in that any content and gaming instructions contained therein are purely for wagering applications. Each of a primary content server a secondary content server or neither may specifically comprise wagering or non wagering games in addition to any type of additional content and gaming methodologies which may specifically specify or otherwise be incorporated into a secondary or unified graphical user interface in accordance with the current invention. Thus the primary game and or content data and the secondary game and or content data may comprise a wide variety of contextual information in addition to particular programmatic instructions and formatting requirements which will ultimately forge presentation data for the display device s and overall operation of the primary gaming machine .

In response to the request for the primary game and content data the primary content server may also include a directive i.e. a command or additional software module causing the primary content controller to initiate specific tasks. This may include authorizing and or configuring the primary content controller to populate the secondary content controller or accessible memory modules with content and or programmatic instructions. Further the primary game and content data may include authorization or software which configures the primary content controller to execute a specific application programming interface API listening process to enable a secondary content controller to access various services of the primary gaming machine controlled by the primary content controller . As detailed prior these services may include random number generation RNG for outcome determinations actuation of mechanical game components of the primary gaming machine etc. This enables the secondary content controller to interface directly with the various operating system services of the primary gaming machine via the API listening process executing on the primary content controller . Further the API listening process shields the primary content controller from knowing where the issued commands originate from. In this way the primary content controller may remain completely unaware that the secondary content controller is mediating all input and output of the primary gaming machine . The API listening process also may be configured to authenticate the secondary content controller as a whole or individual components of the secondary content controller . Authentication may include hash calculations certificate access transfer or any other authentication method as known in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

This configuration of game system architecture enables the secondary content controller to interact and control aspects of a primary game as defined by the primary game and content data simultaneously or completely separate from any secondary games and content executed by secondary controller module . Further the secondary content controller may control mechanical components and have access to other operating system services of the primary gaming machine via the API listening process. In some instances the primary content controller is not specifically aware that a secondary content controller is present or connected and simply responds to specific events with associated programmed instructions which transfer control or processing to a secondary content controller .

The secondary controller module is also capable of using mechanical components of the primary gaming machine solely for use by the secondary content controller e.g. a secondary wagering game . That is the secondary content controller can take sole ownership of various mechanical components of the primary gaming machine and use them directly by requesting services of the primary content controller via the API without requiring an accompanying primary game. Further the secondary content controller may prohibit the primary content controller from using the mechanical components of the primary gaming machine during secondary game execution. The secondary content controller may also perform secondary games which rely on or manipulate results of mechanical processes of a primary game as performed by the primary content controller . The specifics of the interaction of the primary game s and the secondary game s of the primary gaming machine are highly variable and any combination therewith remains part of the intended spirit and scope of the invention.

The secondary game and content data defining the secondary processes e.g. secondary games and secondary content may be remotely stored and retrieved from any part of game system architecture . In one embodiment the secondary content controller and secondary controller module are configured with programmatic instructions from an authorized local or remote source e.g. the primary content server and or the secondary content server . Access to remote information may occur via a communicative coupling which may include a communications network internal to the primary gaming machine or as part of the game system architecture implementing various communication protocols standard or proprietary as is known in the art. The communicative coupling may include network communications between networked elements using standard protocols e.g. TCP IP or opaque communication methods between network processes e.g. network socket . The invention should not be limited by the location of information storage or the type of communicative coupling and messaging which is used to exchange information between components of the game system architecture .

Once the secondary controller module is configured with a graphical user interface and the secondary games as dictated by secondary game and content data the secondary controller module communicates with the primary content controller operating system services via the listening API process. This enables the secondary controller module to interact with the primary gaming machine by sending commands to the operating system services to perform various services and interact with the primary game e.g. set the bet amount initiate a primary game etc. as well as control the primary gaming machine to activate mechanical reels wheels sliders and respond with information indicating the reel wheel slider stops so that the secondary controller module can interpret and manipulate this data using the graphical user interface. This may include enhanced graphical content display aside from or overlaying the primary game graphical user interface. The secondary controller module may also use the primary game information to determine outcomes of a secondary game solely confined to the secondary controller module . That is the outcome of the secondary game executing on the secondary controller module may be contingent on the outcome of the primary game executing on the primary content controller or be relevant solely to the secondary game.

In response to requests from the secondary content controller the operating system services executing on the primary content controller may calculate results of the primary game and send the results back to the secondary controller module for display on the graphical user interface as part of the transfer of winnings to the player. Alternatively the secondary controller module may further request transfer of winnings to the player account via the API by reporting winnings and secondary game results to the primary content controller as if the primary game itself is providing the results. In this way the secondary content controller can control reels reel stops spin behavior and the entire gaming operation on the primary gaming machine using the communication API with native operating system services.

In yet another embodiment a host primary content server may include as part of the primary game and content data a command and associated URL for causing the primary content controller to retrieve using a standardized or proprietary protocol load and execute a secondary process including the secondary game and secondary graphical user interface. This secondary process executes independently from the operating system service of the primary gaming machine and is independent from and unknown to all the operating system services of the primary gaming machine . The secondary game and content data defining the secondary process may be remotely stored and retrieved from anywhere on the network including from the primary content server and or the secondary content server . The separate secondary process executing on the primary content controller becomes logically equivalent to the secondary content controller performing all functions previously outlined for the secondary controller module the detection module and the output module . The secondary process is configured to make connections to the operating system services layer of the primary content controller via the API and may initiate the primary game s and or the secondary game s by sending a command to the API to control mechanical components respond with mechanical component stops etc. The operating system services layer of the primary content controller may then calculate the outcome of the game s and send results to the secondary process to transfer winnings to the player account for the secondary game. Additional various details of this embodiment may be gleaned from the prior discussions of the secondary content controller without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

As mentioned prior the graphical user interface initiated by the secondary content controller may execute wagering and or non wagering applications which may be completely independent from or completely reliant upon the results of a primary wagering and or non wagering game executing on the primary content controller . Typically the secondary content controller receives the graphical user interface and secondary gaming software from a remote or local host subsequent to request or command. It is also possible that the secondary content controller is pre configured with the graphical user interface software prior to initiation.

The secondary content controller may provide games categorized as Class II BINGO type collectively played against other players rather than against the house and or Class III games slot machines blackjack craps roulette and other games of chance . For example this may include a BINGO type game where the win is mapped to reel stops by a BINGO Game Live server e.g. content server or and the primary gaming machine simply acts as a display device or the primary gaming machine provides traditional video reels laid over the mechanical reels as part of the graphical user interface.

It is noted that each component shown in the game system architecture is shown as a separate and distinct element connected via a communications network and or an internal bus . However some functions performed by a particular component may be performed by one or more other components. For example the primary content server can also be configured to perform functions of the primary gaming machine and other network elements and or system devices. Furthermore the components shown may all be contained in one physical or logical device but some or all may be included in or performed by multiple devices or other configurations not explicitly shown.

Furthermore the game system architecture can be implemented as software hardware any combination thereof or other forms of embodiments not listed. For example any of the network components e.g. the game machines servers etc. can include hardware and machine readable storage media including instructions for performing the operations described herein. None of these implementation specifics impact the scope and spirit of the invention as described and any specifics details of one or more of these embodiments or examples should not be considered limiting to the invention as a whole.

In another embodiment the secondary content controller is installed within the physical housing of primary gaming machine e.g. connected via bus such that the primary gaming machine contains all logically defined functional elements including the output module the detection module the secondary controller module the output components the input components and the primary content controller .

The primary gaming machine is turned on and booted which initiates the operating system services of the primary gaming machine . This may further include retrieval and transfer of functional code from one or more remote sources to be executed on a primary controller including the operating system itself gaming and peripheral services player credit bank and money handling a secondary controller listening process a primary game a random number generator RNG service a mechanical reel service and any other required services on the primary content controller as detailed prior.

The secondary controller listening process is an operating system service typically authenticated and initiated by a trusted remote host. The secondary controller listening process receives commands issued from processes other than the primary game as defined in the primary game and content data. These commands are typically generated by the secondary content controller and may result from user interaction with a secondary graphical user interface of a secondary game. The primary content controller loads the secondary controller listening process as directed by the primary game and content data and remote host s . Any secondary graphical user interface is installed on a secondary content controller or as a separate isolated process on a primary content controller . The primary content controller configures the secondary content controller listening process to enable connectivity and communications between processes of the secondary content controller and the primary content controller in the primary gaming machine .

In step the secondary content controller sends a secondary controller start up request to the primary content controller via the API. The secondary controller start up request is a command which requests a list of devices having operating system services and resources which will be granted to the secondary content controller during gameplay. This may include mechanical reels which may spin mechanical wheels which may rotate mechanical or physical sliders which move or mechanical or physical dice which may be deterministically manipulated.

In step the primary content controller responds with a list of available mechanical devices which may be accessed by the secondary content controller via the API. Examples of these services may include mechanical reel control wheel control mechanical slider dice control manipulation etc. which are accessible and controllable by the primary game machine and primary content controller . The available services for these devices are dependent upon the API and a defined set of the devices for the particular primary gaming machine .

In step the secondary content controller requests a list of known events from the primary game which may be used to trigger specific operations when these events occurs. Events may include user input actions e.g. button actuation graphical user interface interactions sensor outputs messages from other programs threads etc. . Events are processed by the primary content controller at the API level and may include rerouting of communications and triggering further events. The operating system and API executing on the primary gaming machine provides a set of functions performed by the primary gaming machine often in response to the triggering of an event. That is a set of events are defined which may trigger associated actions. Any event which involves a function of the primary game must be directed to the primary content controller for execution. In order for the secondary content controller to utilize resources available to the primary content controller the secondary content controller must issue commands or make requests to the primary content controller .

In step the primary content controller responds to the secondary content controller with a list of events which are known to the primary content controller which the secondary content controller may be programmed recognize. These events typically comprise a set of events which are generated as a result of manipulation with the primary gaming machine including button actuation mechanical device state reporting and or various programmatic game states.

In response the secondary content controller determines which event s that are recognized by the primary content controller it wishes to subscribe to. Subscribing to a list of events allows the secondary content controller to be alerted to events which occur on the primary gaming machine which are recognized by the primary content controller and the operation system services executing thereon.

In step the secondary content controller subscribes to a specific set of events recognized by the primary content controller via the API. Once this list of event subscriptions are provided events which occur on the primary gaming machine are delivered i.e. routed to and then processed by the secondary content controller as each event occurs.

Depending on the way the primary gaming machine and API are constructed events which occur may cause messages to flow to both the primary content controller and the secondary content controller in one embodiment. In other embodiments the API is designed to fully divert occurrence of the event to a stored network location or other memory or resource pointer. In some cases the stored network location or resource pointer specifies an address related to a secondary content controller . Further the primary content controller may perform event notification by transmission of an event message to a specified memory or register location which causes an associated processor to react by performing a given action or software routine. In this way it is possible to completely shield the presence of the secondary content controller from the primary content controller . The primary content controller responds to the triggered event with an event notification but there is no knowledge or foresight by the primary content controller regarding the processing or completion of process es associated with the event.

In step the primary content controller returns an event subscription list specifying a list of events which will be routed to the secondary content controller for processing prior to any execution by the primary content controller . As just discussed this may include a variety of differing embodiments which have varying levels of interaction of the primary content controller including no interaction at all.

For example when if a specific action occurs on the primary gaming machine or a specific state of the primary gaming machine is reached a specific event occurs which triggers a corresponding process to be initiated. When an event specified in the subscribed list of events occurs the secondary content controller may receive the event notification and respond accordingly. Sometimes this further includes making further calls to functions defined in the API to control or use other components or services of the primary gaming machine .

Consider an event generated when a physical button of the primary gaming machine is pressed to begin the secondary game. The button press event is recognized solely by the primary content controller . The primary content controller checks the event subscription list to determine whether the event is intended for the secondary content controller i.e. if the event is on the subscription list . If so the event is sent to the secondary content controller for processing. If not the event triggers corresponding functions to occur on the primary gaming machine .

In step the secondary content controller requests ownership and access to the mechanical device service s of the primary gaming machine . This may include calling a specific function of the API via the primary content controller . This may be required because the secondary content controller is providing a graphical user interface and a secondary wagering game is controlling and or using information gleaned from the primary content controller and mechanical component s of the primary gaming machine to control and generate output. Further exclusive access to the mechanical services of the primary gaming machine may need to be established on behalf of the secondary content controller to conduct various aspects of the secondary game s .

In step in response to the request for ownership the primary content controller assigns ownership of the specified mechanical device s to the secondary content controller application s executing on the secondary controller module . This assignment enables the secondary content controller to fully control the operation of the mechanical components of the primary gaming machine . In specific instances for example mechanical reels information mapping the mechanical reels stops symbols etc. may be reported to the secondary controller module as part of this response or may be programmed as part of the secondary content controller prior to ownership. Alternatively this information may be remotely stored and transferred when the ownership message is received or processed or at a later time.

Specified events which occur on the primary gaming machine provided on the event subscription list are routed to the secondary content controller . Thus events which occur on the primary gaming machine may be recognized and processed solely by the secondary content controller . Further commands which originate from the secondary controller module may now be routed to selected mechanical device services executing on the primary content controller . Thus the secondary content controller may now initiate mechanical device actuation using the mechanical device services using an appropriate call via the API by sending a request to the primary content controller and any API call to the mechanical device service sent to the primary content controller from the secondary controller module will now be accepted and performed by the mechanical components as if the request was initiated by the primary content controller .

In a different embodiment the secondary content controller may be directly connected to the input and output device s of the primary game machine for example by connection to an internal bus. This may further enable the secondary content controller to intercept primary gaming machine inputs or events and process them without primary content controller even knowing an event has occurred. As above the secondary content controller may still initiate mechanical device actuation using the mechanical device services by sending a request directly to the primary content controller using an appropriate call to the API 

Once the secondary game is defined the second content controller is subscribed to a list of events is fully connected to the primary gaming machine via the API and the proper resources for game play are secured full interaction between the secondary game and the primary gaming machine may occur. Player input for both the primary game s and the secondary game s may occur as a result of various player interactions with the primary gaming machine .

For example when a secondary graphical interface executed by the secondary content controller is used to start a secondary game there is no required need for the secondary controller module to translate input intended for the primary gaming machine and primary content controller to generate an event. The secondary controller module may generate a corresponding event as a result of the interaction with the graphical user interface processed by secondary content controller . One such event is called a Game Start Event initiating the secondary game play.

Thus when a virtual button on the graphical user interface is used to begin a secondary game or when a physical button on the primary gaming machine is used to trigger secondary game play a Game Start Event is resultantly triggered. The Game Start Event event may cause the secondary content controller to initiate execute and complete one or more selected secondary games. The secondary game s may additionally include actuating mechanical components e.g. spinning reels of the primary gaming machine .

As an example the player initiates a secondary wagering game using the graphical user interface executed by the secondary content controller by selecting a secondary wagering game from a list of secondary wagering games setting a wager amount and starting the secondary wagering game. Some secondary wagering games may use mechanics which implement the mechanical reels of the primary gaming machine without requiring a primary wagering game to be executed. For example the player may select a secondary wagering game which includes a BINGO type game having gaming cards comprising symbols thereon which correspond to one or more symbols on the mechanical reels. The player indicates a wager and picks a corresponding BINGO card for game play.

In step a Button Press Event is generated by player actuation of a physical button of the primary gaming machine to begin the secondary game. If the Button Press Event is specified in the list of subscribed events the Button Press Event is routed to and received by the secondary content controller for processing and a corresponding Game Start Event results.

If a wager is set and a check is made as to whether there are sufficient funds in an account or on a credit meter to cover the wager the funds are considered verified. Once funds are verified the secondary content controller generates the Game Start Event to inform the Accounting Host managing the player funds of deduction and the secondary game is initiated. The Game Start Event is consumed by the secondary game process and results in continued operation of process . Once the secondary game begins any wager amount committed is deducted from a credit meter associated with the secondary game. In the event of an error for example insufficient funds the secondary content controller is typically programmed to respond to each particular condition with a different corresponding process to prohibit functions from taking place or initiating corresponding contingency functions.

In step after the Game Start Event is properly authenticated and consumed the secondary game processor begins a secondary game cycle by notifying the primary content controller that the secondary game has begun. This initiates the secondary game gameplay which may include a series of processes potentially including video generation and other types of initialization presentation specifics and the future sending of commands to the primary content controller via the API to actuate appropriate additional mechanical components of the primary gaming machine in due course.

In response the operating system services executing on the primary content controller requests random numbers from a Random Number Generator RNG server process which may be executing either local to primary gaming machine or remotely by a gaming server e.g. server . The requested random numbers determine a resultant outcome for the secondary game by correlating mechanical component stop values to physical mechanical component positions. The mechanical component stop positions indicate which symbols which will be displayed by the mechanical components when they stop moving. That is an established Operating System OS Services Layer requests the random numbers from the RNG Server and maps them to device specific stops e.g. reel stops for the mechanical components i.e. reels of the primary gaming machine . The OS Service Layer is established as part of the communication API of primary gaming machine enabling exchange of information and events with other operating system services natively running on the primary gaming machine .

In step the OS System Layer service on primary content controller sends the mechanical component stops via the OS Service Layer to the Mechanical Component Service as part of an asynchronous command message. The asynchronous command message initiates rotation of the mechanical components and provides the position s at which the mechanical components will stop moving. That is the mechanical component stop values indicate a particular position where each of the mechanical components will stop and are used by the Mechanical Component Service to stop movement of each component at a given position for example to bear a given symbol to a viewer of the primary gaming machine . The nature of the asynchronous command message is such that the mechanical components perform the desired tasks e.g. initiation of rotation and reel stopping in sequence and messages are sent by the Mechanical Component Service as each task is completed.

In step the Mechanical Component Service activates the component controller s actuates the mechanical components and acknowledges the received command by sending a message back to the primary content controller indicating the mechanical components will be actuated.

In step once the mechanical component s of primary gaming machine are confirmed to be actuated it is confirmed to the player that the secondary game is started. This occurs in the form of a response message sent from primary content controller to the secondary content controller in response to step . The secondary content controller may use this current game state to show video reels running or a BINGO card in the secondary graphical user interface. Alternatively a secondary wagering game may provide animation or graphical supplemental support to the physical actuation of the mechanical components. For example this may include projecting overlay imagery to the transmissive reels or providing animation indicating a game with rotating components is underway.

In step a mechanical component stop event is sent from the Mechanical Component Service to the primary content controller indicating that the primary gaming machine has stopped the mechanical component s of the primary gaming machine . This is an indication confirmation that the mechanical components of the primary gaming machine have stopped moving.

In step another response to step i.e. a component stop event is transmitted from the primary content controller to the secondary content controller along with any additional information or messages relating to the component stop event indicating that the mechanical components of the primary gaming machine have stopped in addition to mechanical stops which indicate where the mechanical component s stopped moving. That is the primary content controller sends the mechanical stop values to the secondary controller module to report the determined secondary game outcome e.g. the reel stop values to the secondary content controller . This enables the secondary game to provide further animation or graphical supplemental support associated with the stopping of the mechanical components.

The secondary content controller may process the stop values to determine an outcome of the game for example based on a Game Outcome Pay Table for Class 3 Games. Other types of processes may be used for example with stored numbers and a pay table for Class 2 Bingo or Pull tab games. For example a win may be mapped to mechanical reel stops for a BINGO card using a remote Bingo Game Live server while the primary gaming machine acts as a display device for the BINGO game. A display of a resultant outcome for the secondary game is typical. For example highlighting the win lines and indicting payouts for each payline. This enables the secondary content controller to complete the visual part of the secondary game.

In step the secondary content controller provides accounting information to the primary content controller for example by transferring details of the win back to the primary game credit meter. That is the secondary content controller transmits details of the outcome of the secondary game back to the primary content controller . Information sent to primary content controller may include accounting information and reflection of winnings accounted to a player credit meter utilized by the primary game. Further the amount of any cumulative win or meter values may be reported to a remote accounting host banking services and or the game history may be written to non volatile random access memory NVRAM . Alternatively the primary content controller may take received information and complete the cycle of the primary game by writing the game history to a specified NVRAM segment and or operating system services communicating with appropriate accounting host s reporting meter values and events which occurred during game play in accordance with various regulations.

In step the primary content controller sends a message indicating that the game cycle has terminated. That is role of the primary gaming machine is complete in regard to the primary and secondary games. This response occurs as a result of the initial game start request made in step .

When the secondary game is initiated by button press or graphical user interface steps through step are repeated until an event is triggered indicating the secondary game terminates. One such example includes the player cashing out and terminating game play. Other examples include use of the graphical user interface to transition solely to the primary game another secondary game or a new combination of primary and secondary games. When secondary game termination occurs the following secondary game termination and ownership release steps take place.

In step the secondary content controller sends a request message to the primary content controller via the API to release ownership of the mechanical components for which ownership was previously assigned in step .

In step a response from the primary content controller is sent to the secondary content controller reporting that ownership of the mechanical devices of the primary gaming machine are released. Commands from the secondary content controller to the primary content controller via the API will no longer control the physical components of the primary gaming machine . In order for the secondary controller module to regain ownership of the mechanical devices and be able to send commands to actuate and manipulate them the primary content controller must perform an ownership assignment to the secondary controller module as previously detailed.

In one embodiment any primary games performed by the primary content controller are not permitted to actuate or assume ownership of the mechanical reels until the mechanical reel service releases or resets ownership of the mechanical reels. Release or reset of ownership of the mechanical reels typically occurs via an API call made by or on behalf of the primary content controller . This may be automatically performed for instance when the secondary game s terminate and will be detailed below.

If a new secondary game or combination of primary game and secondary game are selected the process begins again at step as the secondary content controller and the primary gaming machine initialize the devices and events subscriptions to enable execution of the new selection s by the secondary game.

In differing embodiments the types of messages commands controllers and communication exchanges between the primary content controller the secondary content controller and the Mechanical Component Service including ordering and format may be totally different than this example while not departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

Referring now to a wagering game system includes a wagering game machine connected to a secondary content controller by a bus which may include an internal computing bus and or an external communication channel connecting to a wide area network. The wagering game system also includes a secondary content source . The secondary content controller is connected to the secondary content source via a communications network which may include an internal computing bus or an external communication channel connecting to a wide area network.

The wagering game machine also includes a lower display and an upper display . The wagering game machine is shown comprising a graphical user interface comprising a primary wagering game a secondary wagering game and an upper display section .

A number of virtual buttons are defined for primary wagering game including a payline control button and meter a bet per payline control button and meter the total wager amount meter a win paid meter a spin control button to spin reels A C for the primary wagering game a maximum bet spin button a player credit meter a help button a pay table button and a collect cash out button .

The upper display may include one or more video presentation spaces in the upper display section which may show a variety of video imagery or decorative features dictated by the primary wagering game and or the secondary wagering game . In various embodiments the upper display is an expansion of a presentation area of the graphical user interface the primary wagering game and or the secondary wagering game .

In one embodiment the wheel is presented in conjunction with the upper display and may be utilized for various gaming functions including but not limited to a bonus game initiated by a given trigger or game state. Inclusion of the wheel in the gaming may be initiated by results and or events in either the primary wagering game and or the secondary wagering game . In one embodiment actuation i.e. rotation and stopping of the wheel may occur as a result of a winning combination on the reels A C or may be another type of permanent or transient integrated gaming feature. In the present embodiment instead of a video presentation the wheel is a physical rotating mechanically manipulated wheel actuated and controlled principally by the primary wagering game . This control is in similar fashion to control of the reels A C in that the wheel stops at a particular section of the wheel as indicated by a physical pointer indicating a stopping section similar to the reels A C stopping at designated stops which bear symbols. Alternatively a differing type of pointer may be used including generated video which indicates which section is designated when wheel stops rotating. Designated stops for the wheel may be programmed such that the primary wagering game and the secondary wagering game are able to determine where the pointer points in reference to the symbols regions of the wheel and may further control augmented or enhanced video and imagery for display on the graphical user interface the primary wagering game and or the secondary wagering game corresponding to the determined position of the wheel and the wagering game being relied upon for input.

In one embodiment the graphical user interface including the primary wagering game and the secondary wagering game are generated on a lower display which is a transmissive video display disposed in front of the plurality of symbol bearing mechanical reels A C. Further the display may also be a transmissive video display disposed in front of the wheel . The use of transmissive displays allow the mechanical devices in this embodiment to be visually altered by overlaid imagery and video controlled by the graphical user interface the primary wagering game and or the secondary wagering game .

In one embodiment the secondary content controller fully coordinates the concurrent presentation of the primary wagering game and the secondary wagering game in a unified graphical user interface . The design and layout of the graphical user interface comprising the primary wagering game graphical user interface the secondary wagering game graphical user interface and any additional secondary content added by the secondary content controller is arbitrary and not limited to the current embodiment. Any variation in the layout and design of the sub components of a unified concurrently displaying graphical user interface such as graphical user interface may be reasonably employed without departing from the overall scope and spirit of the invention.

The graphical user interface may be used to control various gaming interface features of the primary wagering game and or the secondary wagering game . This may include additional video dice or video wheel s using various input methods including touch screen buttons or interactive gestures to control or impact gameplay or initiate wagering on one or more of the wagering games. Alternatively the graphical user interface may be used to interact with or control various other gaming machine elements including cameras audio input devices or joysticks to convert player user input into specific game play input like indicating wager amounts and initiating the wager causing the game to play and reel s and or wheel s to spin.

In this embodiment the graphical user interface includes one or more bet control buttons and meters for the secondary wagering game s a total bet meter a secondary wagering game credit meter a cash out collect transfer credits to primary game button a change game control button and a mechanical actuation spin control button . In one embodiment the change game control button may be used to selectively control interaction between the primary wagering game and the secondary wagering game . This may include determining or specifying whether the graphical user interface presented to the player is interacting with the primary wagering game and the secondary wagering game simultaneously or a selection of a new secondary wagering game is desired by the player. The mechanical actuation spin control button may also act to initiate the secondary game by generating a Game Start Event provided all other criterion for secondary game activation are met as detailed prior.

The secondary content controller may also detect input via the display for one or more aspects of the primary wagering game or the secondary wagering game . This occurs when a player touches one or more of the first set of virtual buttons relating to the primary wagering game etc. or one or more of a second set of virtual buttons to actuate features of the primary wagering game and or the secondary wagering game e.g. a bet control button and meter for secondary game s a cash out transfer credits to primary game button a change game control button and or a start game control button . If the input relates to the primary wagering game the secondary content controller sends the touch input that corresponds to the primary wagering game to the primary content controller so that the primary content controller can control the primary game according to the touch input. If the input relates to the secondary wagering game the secondary content controller uses the corresponding touch input to control the secondary wagering game .

Many of these button presses will result in events which may or may not correspond to events defined in the list of events which are provided to the secondary content controller in the same way steps and operate for secondary content controller in regard to . Once a list of events which may be recognized and routed to the secondary content controller is obtained the routing of input and actuation of physical components of wagering machine becomes much simpler.

In many embodiments the secondary content controller is configured to intercept the player inputs made on a touch screen of the display in order to properly translate and determine coordinates for the input according to the specific implementation of the graphical user interface retied upon for the input. Depending on where the player touches input device s e.g. inputs made on the display the secondary content controller determines whether touch inputs relate to the primary wagering game or the secondary wagering game . This may involve various methods including the provision of mapped or specified events detailed prior or regions of the graphical user interface which initiate specific events.

The secondary content controller may use the touch input as controls for either the primary wagering game or the secondary wagering game by translating the coordinates of the selected region of the graphical interface to another set of coordinates usable recognized by the primary wagering game or the secondary wagering game . In other words the secondary content controller can intercept the touch input received from the display for the first virtual buttons and correlate the input to positions of the first virtual buttons on the display to coordinates native to the primary wagering game . The secondary content controller can also detect input via the display for one or more aspects of the secondary wagering game such as when a player touches one or more second virtual buttons the bet control button meter and spin controls to activate the appropriate physical or virtual device for both the primary wagering game and the secondary wagering game . The secondary content controller sends the touch input that corresponds to the primary wagering game to the primary content controller so that the primary content controller can control the primary wagering game according to the touch input and any touch input corresponding to the secondary wagering game is routed to control the secondary wagering game .

In some instances the primary wagering game is suspended in lieu of a secondary wagering game which takes control of the primary game machine and its mechanical components for completing game play. In these embodiments the secondary controller coordinates the presentations of the secondary wagering game and primary wagering game by removing the primary wagering game and its associated graphical user interface from the unified graphical user interface. The secondary controller is in control of all input and output of the presented graphical user interface in these embodiments and may arrange and configure all components of the secondary wagering game accordingly.

One example of this primary game replacement removal is shown in . As described above ownership of any mechanical devices must be assigned prior to the actuation of any mechanical component of the wagering game machine .

There are a number of instances where a secondary wagering game uses and controls physical and mechanical components of a wagering gaming machine . These may include reel based slot machine games which use differing symbols than the symbols presented on the mechanical reels A C of a wagering gaming machine a modified or rudimentary or fully compatible roulette game using a wheel on wagering gaming machine and a BINGO type game where winning BINGO cards or balls are mapped to mechanical reel stops of the wagering gaming machine . Other games may involve other mechanical actuated components for example mechanical dice a flipping coin etc. The invention is not to be limited by the number or type of mechanical components which are relied upon for secondary wagering game completion by utilizing various physical mechanical components of a wagering gaming machine .

In other embodiments any all of the virtual buttons described above may be modified or absent from the implemented graphical user interface and any triggered events generated by actuation of one or more buttons may be completely discretionary. The flexibility of the presentation and effect of manipulation of virtual buttons presented by the graphical user interface is intentional and is not intended to be limiting as long as it does not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention as a whole including enabling a graphical user interface to actuate physical gaming elements of one or more wagering games and one or more gaming machines.

In step the primary controller is initialized to execute primary game logic instructions by one or more central processing units to control various hardware components and generate primary game play. This includes the initialization of the operating system primary game programmatic instructions components API functions etc. and generation of associated video and audio output for the primary game.

In step a secondary controller is initialized to begin secondary game logic instructions by one or more central processing units to control various hardware components to generate secondary game play. Initialization of the secondary controller may occur simultaneously and independently e.g. in parallel to the initialization of the primary controller and the primary game. The secondary controller generates the secondary game s and obtains ownership of mechanical components required for each of the secondary games if appropriate as detailed prior. The secondary controller also generates video and or audio output for the secondary games.

In step the secondary controller defines and constructs the entirety of the graphical user interface which includes the primary game the secondary games and any additional content e.g. menu options multimedia etc. as dictated by the game developer and the overall game design. That is the secondary controller defines the specifics of a graphical user interface used to define interaction with the primary game play and with secondary game play according to a defined layout. The secondary controller merges the video and or audio output of the primary game from the primary controller and the video and or audio data of the secondary games of the secondary controller and creates a unified graphical user interface configured for operationally controlling both primary and secondary games in addition to displaying other specified content.

The process of the secondary controller includes bidirectional mapping i.e. translating of coordinate information used in the unified graphical user interface into coordinate information separately usable by the primary game and or the secondary games. In some embodiments the primary game is confined to a particular section of the video output and translation compression displacement rotation and or other manipulative processing may occur to the primary game video prior to the display of video to the player. The secondary controller determines the layout of the primary game the secondary games additional content and the overall structure of the unified graphical user interface and maps the coordinate system of both primary and secondary game interfaces to the unified graphical user interface such that a coordinate system translation between the unified graphical user interface and the native graphical user interface of each game is achieved.

In one embodiment the secondary controller may compress and displace the primary game video output to make room for a secondary game and or a secondary graphical user interface in addition to the primary graphical user interface used for the primary game. In another embodiment the secondary graphical user interface imagery may be superimposed onto the display of primary game components and the primary graphical user interface. In both cases the unified graphical user interface as defined will seamlessly provide interaction with both the primary game and the secondary games by providing input and output coordinate translation and mapping.

Resultantly the secondary controller is configured to determine a native set of coordinates which may be forwarded to the primary game and or the secondary game depending on various determinations of applicability and corresponding commands are issued to control various aspects of both a primary game and a secondary game accordingly. These commands include the issuance of commands to a primary controller for mechanical actuation of physical components of the gaming machine related to a primary game executed on the primary controller.

In one embodiment the primary controller and primary game have no knowledge of any details relating to the secondary game secondary controller or unified graphical user interface in use the primary game simply operates as originally intended and directed without perception of any secondary processes. That is the presence of a secondary controller and any secondary game s may be indeterminable and undetectable by the primary controller and primary game.

In step the unified graphical user interface is rendered to the player on the output device s of the gaming machine. The resulting output of the unified graphical user interface may include very comprehensive animation highly detailed art rendering high definition video segments etc. which incorporates both the content and graphical user interfaces of the primary game from the primary controller and the secondary games from the secondary controller. Also the input device s of the gaming machine now permits the player to utilize the unified graphical user interface to interact with and select secondary game s initiate primary and or secondary game s etc. via the secondary controller. This occurs as a result of providing triggered events routed to and recognized by the secondary controller according to defined assigned event subscriptions detailed prior.

In step the gaming machine receives user input. As mentioned prior user input may include a variety of differing input methods including activation of one or more areas of a touch screen device i.e. via the unified graphical user interface or activation of a physical button of the gaming machine. Alternatively user input may be achieved by other types of input devices which may be logically assigned to one of two input types physical button input of the gaming machine or graphical user interface input. Regardless of the type the user input may have various effects including changing primary and or secondary games changing wager levels lines in play etc. The user input may also initiate game play either a primary game a secondary game or both. The events defined as a result of these various player actions all correlate to specific function s performed by the gaming machine via the primary controller and or the secondary controller.

In step a determination is made as to whether the user input is a physical button of the gaming machine. User input is categorized into two distinct types physical button input and logical button input. Logical button input typically occurs via graphical user interface i.e. soft buttons but may also be emulated through use of event generation by one or more other machine components. To ease complication any received user input which is not a physical button either of the gaming machine or an extension of the gaming machine like a joystick or other input device is categorized as user input received via the unified graphical user interface step .

In step input information is gathered from use of a graphical user interface and will be used for interpretation of the user input potentially spawning multiple effectual actions and events as a result of the user input. The input information may include raw input coordinate data for activation point s of the particular input device s used or a logical input coordinate set for activation point s in use on the entirety of the unified graphical user interface.

In step the player selected coordinates of the activation point s of the unified graphical user interface presented on the touch screen or other input output devices are provided to the secondary controller for processing. The secondary controller takes the supplied activated coordinates of the unified graphical user interface and translates i.e. maps coordinates in accordance with the layout of the unified graphical user interface to determine whether the player selected a region mapped to a feature of the primary game the secondary game neither or some overlapping region belonging to both. Typically selected input coordinates within the unified graphical user interface are processed by the secondary controller and determined to be processed by or to be routed to the primary or secondary controller accordingly. When input to a primary graphical user interface occurs coordinates are generally converted to a native coordinate system of the primary graphical user interface. Other specific types of particular event generation or coordinate translation processes allow a wide variety of implementable details at this stage.

In step a graphical user interface input event is generated by the secondary controller which specifies the results of the process routing determination and the effect that the input will have upon the games in play and gaming machine as a whole. Specifically this graphical user interface input event will distinguish each differing type of soft key input i.e. graphical user interface button selection from all others. For example mapping player input to a primary game graphical user interface Max Bet Spin button may generate a Max Bet Spin event or the Select Lines primary game graphical user interface button triggers an event causing the number of lines in play to change etc. Similarly the secondary controller generates events for the secondary games and all the associated virtual buttons therewith. Each of the buttons may map to unique events which are used to conduct and control game play of the primary and or secondary games.

In step a determination is made as to whether the event which has been triggered is intended for a function of processing performed by the primary controller. An event intended for the primary controller may be a result of activation of a soft button on the primary graphical user interface correlating to an action exclusively handled by the primary controller. Examples may include actuation of the Pay Table or HELP buttons associated with the primary game. Typically if the secondary controller determines an input in a selected region of the screen relating solely to the primary game the input is routed to the primary controller using a set of native coordinates corresponding to the actuated region obtained through translation transformation of the input coordinates.

In step if the event is appropriate for the secondary controller to process a determination is made as to whether the event is a Game Start event which requires a mechanical component actuation of the gaming machine as discussed prior.

In step if the event is not a Game Start event which requires the primary controller to perform a given function e.g. another event which does not specifically require routing of a command to the primary content controller the secondary controller performs the appropriate function in regard to the secondary game s as indicated by the input event. For instance one such input event may include bet control for a secondary game and or an actuation of a Pay Table or HELP soft button associated with one or more secondary game s . Further actuation of the COLLECT soft button may simply terminate the secondary game and stop processing of the secondary controller altogether after the appropriate accounting and or game state writing processes to persistent memory as required by regulation or design.

Once the appropriate secondary game function is performed and completed by the secondary controller associated to the triggered event flow returns to presentation of the unified graphical user interface and the gaming machine waits for further user input i.e. step to continue with the gaming cycle.

However if in step it is determined that the event is intended for the primary controller the event is forwarded to the primary controller for processing. This may include issuance of one or more commands by the secondary controller to the primary controller via the API.

Similarly if in step the event is determined to be a Game Start event requiring the secondary controller to request at least one mechanical component of the gaming machine to conduct the secondary game the event is forwarded or issued to the primary controller. This transfer of event may occur in a number of varying ways including issuing commands directly using the primary controller API to effect control of mechanical component s of the gaming machine as discussed prior. Alternatively other functions as defined in the API may be used to transfer control to or request action of the primary controller and its associated services.

Returning to the reception of user input detailed in step step is performed when user input is received via physical buttons of the gaming machine. That is in response to a button of the gaming machine being actuated a process may be performed by the primary controller as a result of the secondary controller configured with event subscriptions and interceptive capabilities as detailed prior. The primary controller is able to process this input to control the gaming machine in various ways including mechanical component actuation for the primary game and or the secondary game s .

In step a button input event is generated by the primary controller specifying an event associated with the actuated button. As above this event will distinguish each differing type of button input from all others provided the functions of the buttons are distinct . For example pressing the gaming machine button related to the primary game Max Bet Spin function may generate a Max Bet Spin event or pressing a button relating to a primary game Select Lines event may cause the number of lines in play to change etc. Each of the gaming machine buttons may map to unique events used to conduct and control game play of the primary game and or the secondary game s depending upon implementation of secondary controller and overall gaming design.

In step a determination is made as to whether the generated button event is a secondary controller subscribed event. If so the event is routed to the secondary controller for processing and the process continues in step under direct control of the secondary controller. When the event is not a secondary controller subscribed event this indicates that the event is intended for processing by the primary controller. The primary controller determines the type of event and any appropriate or programmed process es performed as a result of a particular triggered event which is not forwarded or rerouted to the secondary controller.

In a case where there is no associated process assigned to be performed by the primary controller and or the secondary controller in response to a given event the input may be simply ignored by the primary controller. This may occur when the secondary controller is in complete control of all of the gaming functions and a button actuation event occurs which is unknown to the secondary controller processes or is undefined along with any associated input event.

Other triggered events may also be specified at this stage of the process including events which have been determined to be specifically intended for the primary game executing on the primary controller step . Further an API call by the secondary controller in response to a Game Start event which requires the secondary controller to actuate at least one mechanical component of the gaming machine to conduct complete the secondary game step is also processed by the primary controller at this stage. Further events are generated as a result of calls to the API which call for mechanical actuation of gaming machine component s .

In step a determination is made by the primary processor as to whether the event due for processing is actuating a mechanical component of the machine.

In step if the event is not a Game Start event or another event which causes a Game Start event chain or some other initiated actuation of mechanical components of the gaming machine the primary controller performs the appropriate function in regard to the primary game. As above this may include actuation of bet control Pay Table or HELP physical buttons of the gaming machine which does not cause the primary game to initiate and actuate physical components of the gaming machine. Further actuation of a physical COLLECT button may simply terminate the primary game and stop processing of the secondary controller altogether after appropriate accounting and or game state writing processes and or information transfer occurs to a persistent memory as required by regulation or design. In the event that the primary gaming process is not terminated in this fashion the process flow returns to a state where the unified graphical user interface is presented to the user and the gaming machine awaits player input once again step .

However when the event and or API function calls on behalf of the secondary controller indicates actuation of mechanical components of the gaming machine the mechanical service of the primary game machine are accessed and controlled as detailed prior. In the event that the secondary controller is controlling mechanical actuation of components exchanges of information between the primary controller and secondary controller may occur as a result of the interrogation.

In step the primary controller actuates the mechanical component s of the gaming machine as appropriate. This process is detailed above in reference to . In one embodiment an asynchronous message scheme is used which begins with a single request message spawning several response messages upon completion of various phases of actuation completion. One such embodiment provides distinct messages from the mechanical service indicating the mechanical parts are moving and stopping. Other embodiments may include the return of stop values as detailed prior.

In step after actuation of the mechanical component s terminates the current gaming cycle is finalized and completed. This may involve each respective controller performing tasks which terminate the overall cycle of the primary and secondary game s . This may additionally include further bonus rounds sounds and animation reporting of associated wins for all games etc. Further the writing of game states and accounting totals may be required to conform to various regulations. When completed both the primary and secondary games may be restored to an initial state which permits initiation of one or more of the primary and or secondary games again i.e. a new gaming cycle . In many cases this returns flow of the process to step to prompt the player to play another game or provide other input.

As mentioned prior because the secondary controller may be operationally independent from the primary game and primary gaming machine the secondary controller may generate a secondary game and secondary graphical user interface which has no knowledge of details of the primary game primary gaming machine or any operational details of either. In a more typical implementation the secondary controller is developed to interact with one or more specific primary gaming machines and associated components while conforming to one or more standardized models of configuration. This may include video and audio output and messaging methodologies enabling the unified graphical user interface to provide interaction with both primary game and secondary game control functions.

In general the primary controller and the executing primary game is completely oblivious to any specific operations of the secondary controller any secondary graphical user interface in use and any operational details of secondary games instantiated by the secondary controller. In one embodiment the primary controller reacts to the secondary controller calls to the API as if the calls are coming from the primary controller itself. In one embodiment the operations of the primary controller may not be altered or modified by the secondary controller in any way other than the superficial modification of presentation data through output devices specifically audio and video output.

In one embodiment the primary game and the primary controller operate completely independently and functionally unaltered by the secondary controller other than the presentation modification of video and audio output. The secondary controller may further modify output to include additional content and provides input coordinate transforming of the modified output screen s back to the native coordinate system generated and expected by the primary controller. Thus operation and presence of the secondary controller including presence and operation of the secondary controller resultant manipulation of output by the secondary controller and input coordinate translation performed by the secondary controller are completely indeterminable by and irrelevant to the primary controller in many embodiments.

Each of these embodiments and obvious variations thereof is contemplated as falling within the spirit and scope of the claimed invention which is set forth in the following claims. Moreover the present concepts expressly include any and all combinations and subcombinations of the preceding elements and aspects.
