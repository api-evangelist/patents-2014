The present invention relates to a technology of a deep ultraviolet LED typified by an AlGaN based deep ultraviolet LED Light Emitting Diode that is a III V group nitride semiconductor light emitting element.

As an example of a deep ultraviolet LED with a light emission wavelength of 220 to 350 nm there is known an AlGaN based deep ultraviolet LED with a design wavelength of 280 nm that has a structure in which a p GaN contact layer with high absorptance of deep ultraviolet rays is combined with an Au electrode with low reflectivity of deep ultraviolet rays. There is also known a technique of replacing such a p GaN contact layer with a p AlGaN contact layer that is transparent to the deep ultraviolet rays and further replacing the Au electrode with an Al reflecting electrode with high reflectivity thereby improving the LEE Light Extraction Efficiency as well as improving the EQE External Quantum Efficiency .

Non Patent Literature 1 and Non Patent Literature 2 report that regarding the above technique inserting a Ni layer which is as thin as 1 nm and thus has suppressed absorption of deep ultraviolet rays between the Al reflecting electrode and the transparent p AlGaN contact layer to obtain ohmic contact therebetween was found to improve the LEE to 15 and also improve the EQE from 3.8 to 7 .

However when a transparent p AlGaN contact layer is used the forwarding voltage is increased by about 5 V as compared to when the conventional p GaN contact layer is used. Thus the wall plug efficiency WPE deteriorates to 3 . This is estimated to be due to the reason that ohmic contact between the transparent p AlGaN contact layer and the Al reflecting electrode cannot be sufficiently secured even if a Ni layer is inserted. Further stacking the Ni layer while controlling the thickness thereof to as thin as 1 nm involves great technical difficulties and thus has a great influence on the production cost and yield when producing products. Thus improvement of the LED structure to obtain WPE at about an equal level to EQE is still a challenge to be achieved.

In response to such a background Patent Literature 1 discloses improving the light extraction efficiency by providing an opening in the p GaN contact layer thereby causing a part of light from a light emitting layer that has passed through the opening to be partially reflected by a reflecting metal layer. However the influence of absorption of light by the p GaN contact layer other than the opening cannot be eliminated. That is it has been basically impossible to control and suppress absorption of light by the p GaN contact layer.

Meanwhile in Patent Literature 2 that is related to an invention of the applicant of the present invention the LEE is improved by forming one or more photonic crystals with a periodic structure that satisfies Bragg scattering conditions at an interface between two structures with different refractive indices at a given depth position of a light extraction layer. However the embodiment of Patent Literature 2 is related to improving the LEE by forming the photonic crystal periodic structure in the light extraction layer and thus suppressing total reflection of light with the design wavelength at the interface. That is Patent Literature 2 does not specifically disclose introducing a photonic crystal periodic structure for reflection purposes that is formed such that it penetrates a plurality of layers by giving priority to transmission of light with the photonic crystal periodic structure.

It is an object of the present invention to increase the light extraction efficiency of a deep ultraviolet LED while maintaining high power conversion efficiency thereof.

According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a deep ultraviolet LED with a design wavelength of including a reflecting electrode layer a metal layer a p type GaN contact layer and a p type AlGaN layer that are sequentially stacked from a side opposite to a substrate the p type AlGaN layer being transparent to light with the wavelength of and a photonic crystal periodic structure provided in a range including at least an interface between the p type GaN contact layer and the p type AlGaN layer in a thickness direction. The photonic crystal periodic structure has a photonic band gap.

Regarding a decrease in the wall plug efficiency WPE with an increase in the contact resistance which becomes a problem when the external quantum efficiency EQE is improved by providing the p type AlGaN layer and high efficiency Al reflecting electrode it is possible to lower the contact resistance and improve the wall plug efficiency WPE by providing a p type GaN contact layer while it is possible to improve the LEE by providing a reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure in the p type GaN contact layer and the p type AlGaN layer.

The reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure reflects light with the wavelength of by having a photonic band gap. Thus as the absorption of light by the metal layer and the p type nitride semiconductor can be suppressed the light extraction efficiency can be increased.

According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for manufacturing a deep ultraviolet LED including a step of preparing a stacked structure with a design wavelength of the stacked structure including a reflecting electrode layer a metal layer a p type GaN contact layer and a p type AlGaN layer that are sequentially stacked from a side opposite to a substrate the p type AlGaN layer being transparent to light with the wavelength of 

a step of preparing a mold for forming a photonic crystal periodic structure the photonic crystal periodic structure being provided in a range including at least an interface between the p type GaN contact layer and the p type AlGaN layer in a thickness direction 

a step of forming a resist layer on the stacked structure and imprinting a structure of the mold to the resist layer and

a step of forming a photonic crystal periodic structure by sequentially etching the stacked structure using the resist layer as a mask.

This specification contains the descriptions of the specification and or drawings of the Japanese patent application JP 2014 043388 that serves as a basis for priority claim of the present application.

According to the present invention it is possible to significantly improve the LEE while avoiding deterioration of the WPE.

Hereinafter embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings. As an example a deep ultraviolet LED structure of an AlGaN based deep ultraviolet LED is shown that can prevent deterioration of ohmic contact by using a p GaN contact layer i.e. p GaN contact layer and a transparent p AlGaN contact layer i.e. p AlGaN contact layer in combination thereby preventing deterioration of the WPE as well as improving the LEE without requiring thinness of a stacked metal layer.

The columnar structure is provided in the range including the interface between the p GaN contact layer and the transparent p AlGaN contact layer in the thickness direction.

As shown in a columnar structure may have a structure in which the structure does not reach the interface between the p GaN contact layer and the Ni layer . As shown in a columnar structure may have a structure in which the structure does not reach the interface between the transparent p AlGaN contact layer and the p AlGaN layer . In addition as shown in a columnar structure may have a structure in which the structure does not reach the interface between the p GaN contact layer and the Ni layer .

That is it is acceptable as long as the photonic crystal periodic structure is provided in the range including at least the interface between the p type GaN contact layer and the p type AlGaN contact layer in the thickness direction.

It should be noted that a photonic crystal periodic structure shown in shows a view of a reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure that is formed such that it penetrates all layers of from the Al reflecting electrode layer to the transparent p AlGaN contact layer . An other layer s may also be included within the range that the relative order of the layer to the layer is unchanged. It should be noted that the transparent p type nitride semiconductor contact layer may typically be referred to as a p type nitride semiconductor layer and such p type nitride semiconductor layer may combine the function of the p AlGaN layer .

The photonic crystal periodic structure or is a reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure in which triangular lattices each of which includes circular holes with bottom surfaces are repeated as unit structures on the planes of the stacked layers. It should be noted that the unit structures may also be other unit structures such as tetragonal lattices. The photonic crystal periodic structure is desirably formed on the entire planes of the stacked layers to improve the LEE but may also be formed on a part of the planes.

The transparent p AlGaN contact layer may also be understood as a structure in which the thickness of a p GaN contact layer which absorbs light with the wavelength is partially replaced by a p AlGaN contact layer that contains 50 Al and is transparent to light with the wavelength . Herein the term transparent means that the transmissivity with respect to light with the wavelength is greater than or equal to 95 for example. As the Ni layer strongly absorbs light with the wavelength it is desirable that the Ni layer be ideally extremely thin as thin as about 1 nm. However the Ni layer may also have a thickness of greater than or equal to about 10 nm by taking practicality into consideration.

The reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure or refers to a structure in which as represented in the depth h is ideally controlled so that the bottom surfaces of the circular holes are located at the interface between the transparent p AlGaN contact layer and the p AlGaN layer . It should be noted that the transparent p AlGaN contact layer may combine the function of the p AlGaN layer . In such a case the bottom surfaces of the circular holes i.e. depth h may be located in the p AlGaN layer .

Further it is also possible to provide a LED structure in which a transmissive photonic crystal periodic structure is also formed on the light extraction surface side of a sapphire substrate for example in addition to the reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure or in accordance with this embodiment. Such a structure may rather have improved LEE than a LED structure that has a single reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure formed therein.

According to this embodiment regarding a decrease in the wall plug efficiency WPE with an increase in the contact resistance which becomes a problem when the external quantum efficiency EQE is improved by providing a transparent p type nitride semiconductor contact layer and a high efficiency Al reflecting electrode it is possible to lower the contact resistance with the electrode by providing a p GaN contact layer while it is possible to improve the LEE by providing a reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure.

A deep ultraviolet LED in accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention is a deep ultraviolet LED in which the photonic crystal periodic structure described in the first embodiment is designed to satisfy the following requirements. That is the photonic crystal periodic structure has transparent p AlGaN and the air which have different refractive indices formed as two structures at the bottom surface and satisfies Bragg scattering conditions represented by the following formula provided that the average refractive index of the structures is n where nis the function of the period a and the radius R of the circular hole and the period is a. 2 Formula 1 

According to the second embodiment it is possible to improve the LEE which is difficult to be achieved with a periodic structure that only has a period a which has about the same value as the design wavelength of the deep ultraviolet LED and the radius R of a circular hole.

The deep ultraviolet LED in accordance with the third embodiment of the present invention is a deep ultraviolet LED in which the parameters of the photonic crystal periodic structure with the photonic band gap described in the second embodiment are determined in accordance with the following procedures. That is the band structure of the TE polarized components is analyzed by a plane wave expansion method using R a which is the ratio of the radius R of the circular hole to the period a tentatively determined in advance the design wavelength and the dielectric constants and of the two structures corresponding to the refractive indices nand nof the respective structures. Specifically the dielectric constants and are input to the Maxwell s electromagnetic field wave equation Formula 2 represented by the following formula which has been obtained by expanding the plane wave with a wavelength of by a magnetic field H to compute eigen values in the wave number space and thus analyze the photonic band structure of the TE polarized components. Then the photonic band gap is determined from the analysis results and such determination is repeated hereinafter. Accordingly one or more candidates of R a at which the photonic band gap is maximum is are selected from the tentatively determined R a.

Herein denotes an inverse number of a dielectric constant G denotes a reciprocal lattice vector denotes frequency c denotes light velocity and k denotes a wave number vector.

It should be noted that the photonic band structure of the TE polarized components is analyzed herein in order to cause light with the wavelength from the light emitting layer to be maximally reflected by the interface to the light extraction surface side. This can be explained by the fact that the electric field of TE light will easily accumulate on the plane of the periodic structure at a connected portion of dielectrics that are provided in parallel with the plane of the periodic structure and thus that light with the wavelength will be reflected by the plane of the electric field due to Bragg scattering when the parameters of the periodic structure and the wavelength satisfy the Bragg scattering conditions.

Further the parameters of the photonic crystal periodic structure or are desirably parameters obtained by computing the period a and the radius R of the circular hole which have been obtained from the selected candidate R a and the processing depth h of the periodic structure with a period of greater than or equal to a for each order m of the Bragg scattering conditions conducting simulation on each parameter group using the FDTD method and selecting from the simulation results an optimal combination of the order m the period a the radius R and the depth h that most improves the LEE.

According to the third embodiment TE light from the light emitting layer is reflected by the photonic crystal periodic structure. Thus it is possible to increase the degree of freedom of selection of the types of the reflecting electrode layer and the metal layer and improve the LEE.

A deep ultraviolet LED in accordance with the fourth embodiment of the present invention is a deep ultraviolet LED characterized in that the formation processing depth h of the photonic crystal periodic structure or described in the third embodiment is greater than or equal to the period a as a condition to obtain high LEE. It should be noted that as the depth h the total thickness of the portion of the photonic crystal periodic structure that penetrates at least the p GaN contact layer and the transparent p AlGaN contact layer is desirably greater than or equal to of the period a and more preferably greater than or equal to the period a.

Even the depth h that is greater than or equal to of the period a is effective as a reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure in view of the limitation of the processing accuracy due to the high aspect ratio. However it is desirable to provide the depth h that is greater than or equal to the period a as in the fourth embodiment by overcoming the limitation of the accuracy using the production method described below.

The deep ultraviolet LED in accordance with the fifth embodiment of the present invention is a deep ultraviolet LED characterized in that the photonic crystal periodic structure described in the fourth embodiment is the photonic crystal periodic structure reference numeral of that penetrates all layers of from the Al reflecting electrode layer to the transparent p AlGaN contact layer .

According to the fifth embodiment the photonic crystal periodic structure can be formed at a time in succession such that it penetrates layers of from the reflecting electrode layer. Thus the technical difficulty of forming the photonic crystal periodic structure in some of the layers in the LED can be avoided thus enabling simplification of the production steps and cost reduction.

A deep ultraviolet LED in accordance with the sixth embodiment of the present invention is a deep ultraviolet LED that has the deep ultraviolet LED structure described in the fifth embodiment and has a structure in which layers described below are sequentially and relatively stacked. That is as exemplarily described above the deep ultraviolet LED includes from the substrate side the p AlGaN layer as a p type nitride semiconductor layer the transparent p AlGaN contact layer as a transparent p type nitride semiconductor contact layer and the p GaN contact layer as a contact layer on the metal layer side. The reflecting electrode layer and the metal layer can be obtained by though not particularly limited thereto combining an Al or Au reflecting electrode and a Ni or Pd or Pt layer. In particular as the type of metal metal whose adhesion to the inner wall of the circular hole can be suppressed is desirably used.

According to the sixth embodiment a highly advantageous effect of improving the LEE of the deep ultraviolet LED can be expected to be achieved by adopting such a layer structure.

A deep ultraviolet LED in accordance with the seventh embodiment of the present invention is a deep ultraviolet LED characterized in that the photonic crystal periodic structure or described in the first to sixth embodiments is formed by using a imprint technology of a nanoimprinting lithography method. The nanoimprinting lithography technology is an optimal process for forming a fine projection recess structure pattern on the order of nm to m on the entire surface of a large substrate with a size of 8 inches for example.

It should be noted that photoresist used in the imprint technology of the nanoimprinting lithography method should have high fluidity so as to closely fill a mold with a fine projection recess structure pattern. However the fluidity will cause deterioration of the etching selectivity of the transparent p AlGaN contact layer . Herein the deep ultraviolet LED in accordance with the eighth embodiment of the present invention is a deep ultraviolet LED characterized by having a photonic crystal periodic structure formed by a imprint technology using a bi layer resist method that can provide both high fluidity and high etching selectivity.

According to the seventh embodiment a photonic crystal periodic structure designed in accordance with this embodiment can be accurately imprinted to resist in a large area in units of nm. According to the eighth embodiment it is possible to form a photonic crystal periodic structure with a high aspect ratio designed in accordance with any of the embodiments of the present invention.

An example of the present invention will be described with reference to . The following table Table 1 shows the composition dope film thickness refractive index and the like of each layer. The design wavelength is 280 nm. The reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure formed has a photonic band gap with respect to the wavelength and reflects light from the light emitting layer toward the light extraction layer side that is to the sapphire substrate side.

The photonic crystal periodic structure is a reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure that includes circular holes with bottom surfaces at the interface between the transparent p AlGaN contact layer and the p AlGaN layer and has a triangular lattice formed by the circular holes as a unit structure. Two structures with different refractive indices that form such a periodic structure are transparent p AlGaN and the air or another medium. The average refractive index nthereof is determined by the following formula Formula 3 .

It should be noted that the transparent p AlGaN contact layer and the p AlGaN layer may be combined as a single layer. The transparent p AlGaN contact layer may simply be referred to as a p type AlGaN layer. The composition dope film thickness refractive index and the like of each layer including Table 1 are exemplary values used in the simulation. Thus the structure of the deep ultraviolet LED including transparency is not limited to the parameters shown in the table.

In Example 1 herein it is desirable that the photonic crystal periodic structure be ideally formed such that it penetrates all layers of from the Al reflecting electrode layer to the transparent p AlGaN contact layer and also that the air be used as the medium of the circular hole in view of the production cost and the like. Meanwhile when the photonic crystal periodic structure that penetrates only the p GaN contact layer and the transparent p AlGaN contact layer is formed using a liftoff method in the stacking step will allow the use of the air as the medium of the circular hole as with the photonic crystal periodic structure that is formed such that it penetrates all layers of from the Al reflecting electrode layer to the transparent p AlGaN contact layer . In addition the medium is not necessarily limited to the air as long as if the high level technical problem and cost disadvantages can be overcome it has a lower refractive index than the transparent p AlGaN contact layer and does not absorb light with the wavelength .

It should be noted that the transparent p AlGaN contact layer may combine the function of the p AlGaN layer . In such a case the bottom surfaces of the circular holes i.e. depth h may be located in the p AlGaN layer . 2 3 Formula 3 

Herein R a that is the ratio of the radius R of the circular hole to the period a is finally determined as a value at which the LEE is the maximum through the following steps. However R a is tentatively determined herein. The average refractive index nis computed assuming that the tentatively determined R a is 0.40 the refractive index n of the transparent p AlGaN contact layer is 2.65 and the refractive index n of the air is 1.00.

Next the radius R and the period a corresponding to the tentatively determined R a 0.40 are determined from the n 1.88 herein and the Bragg scattering conditions of the following formula Formula 4 for each order m 1

As a result it is found that a 149 and R 59.5 when m 2 a 224 and R 89.5 when m 3 and a 298 and R 119.5 when m 4.

Further the band structure is analyzed by a plane wave expansion method using the tentatively determined R a the refractive indices nand n and the dielectric constants 1.00 and 7.02 corresponding thereto. Specifically the dielectric constants and and R a are input to the Maxwell s electromagnetic field wave equation represented by the following formula Formula 5 which has been obtained by expanding a plane wave with a wavelength of by a magnetic field H to compute eigen values in the wave number space and thus determine the photonic band structure of the TE polarized components. Then the photonic band gap is determined from the thus determined band structure.

Herein denotes an inverse number of a dielectric constant G denotes a reciprocal lattice vector denotes frequency c denotes light velocity and k denotes a wave number vector.

Again new R a in Example 1 herein R a 0.25 0.30 0.35 etc. is tentatively determined to determine the photonic band gap of the TE polarized components in the same way. Such a step is repeated to study which R a provides the maximum photonic band gap and thus select a candidate R a. The period a and the radius R are computed from the selected candidate R a for each order m of the Bragg scattering conditions as described above and further the processing depth h of the photonic crystal periodic structure is added as a parameter to conduct simulation using the FDTD method. Then a combination of the order m the period a the radius R and the depth h at which the maximum LEE is exhibited is determined. Consequently it was determined that R a 0.40 the order m 4 the period a 298 nm and the radius R 119.5 nm in Example 1 herein.

The LEE rate of change that is an index of the advantageous effect of Example 1 herein is represented by the following formula Formula 6 that is the rate of change of the output 2 relative to the output 1. LEE Rate of Change Output 2 Output 1 Output 1 Formula 6 

Herein the output 2 is the optical output value of the LED structure that is the result of Example 1 herein while the output 1 is the optical output value as a reference to be compared with the output 2. The LED structure corresponding to the output 1 is as shown in the following table Table 2 and . The LED structure herein does not have formed therein the reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure in accordance with this embodiment. Further the structure does not include a metal layer or a p GaN contact layer but instead both the layers are replaced by the transparent p AlGaN contact layer . It should be noted that the optical output value is the value of an optical output from the light emitting layer with the deep ultraviolet LED structure that is received by a monitor arranged on each of the side surfaces i.e. four outer wall surfaces and the front surfaces i.e. top surface and bottom surface of the LED used for a simulation model based on the FDTD method.

Table 3 and show the simulation results of the FDTD based on the parameters of the reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure determined by the aforementioned design. Specifically in a combination of the thicknesses of the p GaN contact layer and the transparent p AlGaN contact layer and the depth h at which the photonic crystal periodic structure is formed were used as parameters and the LEE of the front surface output of each LED structure was compared with the LEE of the front surface output of the LED structure in so as to be compared as the LEE rate of change.

Table 3 and the ordinate axis of show the LEE rate of change of the output of the front surface of the LED. The leftmost column of Table 3 and the abscissa axis of represent a combination of the thicknesses of the p GaN contact layer and the transparent p AlGaN contact layer represented by nm nm which include 0 300 50 250 100 200 200 100 and 300 0. It should be noted that the total thickness of the two layers herein was set to 300 nm for the sake of convenience to compare the increase decrease of the LEE in accordance with not only the influence of the thickness of each layer but also the ratio of the thicknesses of the two layers. Herein the case of 300 0 corresponds to a comparison example of Example 1 herein which represents a LED structure without the transparent p AlGaN contact layer in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention. Likewise the case of 0 300 represents the LED structure in without a photonic crystal periodic structure corresponding to the output 1 that is the reference used to compute the LEE rate of change.

The uppermost row of Table 3 and the axis in the depth direction of represent the depth h at which the photonic crystal periodic structure is formed which include 0 100 200 300 and 460 nm. The case where the depth h is 300 nm corresponds to a case where a periodic structure is formed in each of the p GaN contact layer and the transparent p AlGaN contact layer . Likewise the case where the depth is 460 nm corresponds to a case where a periodic structure is formed such that it penetrates all layers of from the Al reflecting electrode layer to the transparent p AlGaN contact layer . In Table 3 and this is indicated by Penetrate. The case where the depth is 0 nm represents the output 1 LEE rate of change 0 which is the reference used to compute the LEE increase decrease rate of the LEE structure in .

As is clear from the results shown in Table 3 and the front surface output of the LED is significantly increased by the introduction of the transparent p AlGaN contact layer and the formation of the reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure or . Specifically the thickness of the p GaN contact layer that absorbs light with the wavelength was suppressed to the range of 50 to 200 nm while the transparent p AlGaN contact layer in the range of 250 to 100 nm was introduced and further the reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure was formed at a depth h of greater than or equal to 300 nm that is about equal to the period a whereby it was possible to obtain a LEE rate of change of greater than or equal to 113 for the front surface output of the LED that is an output that is 2.13 times that of the output 1. Such advantageous effect is recognized regardless of whether or not the reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure is formed such that it penetrates layers of from the Al reflecting electrode layer to the transparent p AlGaN contact layer . When the depth h of the photonic crystal periodic structure is 200 nm the LEE rate of change i.e. front surface output is increased. This corresponds to the depth of about of the period a of the structure in this example. From the results it can be said that the reflection effect of the photonic crystal periodic structure appears even when the depth is greater than or equal to of the period a.

Likewise Table 4 and show the LEE increase decrease rate of the total output of the side surfaces and the front surfaces of the LED while Table 5 and show the LEE rate of change of the side surface output.

From Table 4 and similar results to those of the aforementioned discussion can be obtained. Specifically introducing the transparent p AlGaN contact layer in the range of 250 to 100 nm suppressing the range of the p GaN contact layer to 50 to 200 nm and forming the reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure at a depth h of greater than or equal to 300 nm can obtain LEE that is 1.19 times higher at a maximum.

It should be noted that depending on the package structure of the LED or the application of the LED a reference used to determine whether or not each of the parameters of the photonic crystal periodic structure at that time is optimum will differ in accordance with the results of the FDTD simulation. That is a variety of references such as the output of the front surfaces of the LED the total output of the output of the front surfaces and the output of the side surfaces of the LED or luminance characteristics in the near field or the far field may be used. Conversely depending on the reference used each of the parameters of the reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure that are evaluated as optimal and thus are determined will differ. It should be noted that the near field is mainly referred to when the LEE rate of change is observed while the far field is referred to when the LEE rate of change and the angular distribution of the radiation pattern are observed.

In Example 2 herein the LEE rate of change of the front surface output of a LED with a photonic crystal periodic structure which is formed such that it penetrates all layers 460 nm of from the reflecting electrode layer to the transparent p AlGaN contact layer was compared for cases where the type of the electrode differs Al or Au. Table 6 shows the LED structure when the thicknesses of the p GaN contact layer and the transparent p AlGaN contact layer are 200 and 100 respectively and an Au electrode is used. Table 7 shows the results of comparison between the influence of the difference of the electrode on the LEE of the front surface output of the LED for each combination of the thicknesses of the p GaN contact layer and the transparent p AlGaN contact layer with the LEE of the LED structure in . shows a diagram thereof.

As is clear from the tables and drawing there is no big difference in the LEE rate of change depending on whether an Al electrode or an Au electrode is used when the other conditions are the same. Thus introducing the LED structure and the reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure in accordance with the present invention can increase the degree of freedom of selection of the reflecting electrode material as needed.

In Examples 1 and 2 above the combination of the thicknesses of the p GaN contact layer and the transparent p AlGaN contact layer that form the photonic crystal periodic structure or was changed in increments of 50 nm and the LEE increase decrease rates due to the difference were compared and studied. Example 3 herein confirmed in detail the relationship between the thicknesses of the p GaN contact layer and the transparent p AlGaN contact layer and the effect of suppressing absorption of light by the p GaN contact layer due to the introduction of the photonic crystal periodic structure i.e. the reflection effect of the photonic crystal periodic structure . In the deep ultraviolet LED structure shown in the following table Table 8 the thickness of the p GaN contact layer was changed in increments of 10 nm in the range of 200 to 300 nm and the LEE increase decrease rates due to the difference were compared and studied Table 9 . Herein the photonic crystal periodic structure that penetrates all layers of from the Al reflecting electrode layer to the transparent p AlGaN contact layer was formed by setting the parameters of the photonic crystal periodic structure such that the order m of the Bragg scattering conditions is 4 the radius R of the circular hole is 119.5 nm the period a is 298 nm and the depth h is 460 nm. It should be noted that Table 9 also shows as a reference the result of the LEE increase decrease rate when for the p GaN contact layer in the thickness range of 0 to 200 the combination of the thicknesses of the p GaN contact layer and the transparent p AlGaN contact layer confirmed in Example 1 is set to 50 nm.

As shown in Table 9 when the thickness of the p GaN contact layer is 260 nm in this case the thickness of the transparent p AlGaN contact layer is 40 nm the LEE rate of change i.e. total output is increased by 2 . From the results it is considered that when the order m of the Bragg scattering conditions as the parameter of the photonic crystal periodic structure is set to 4 it is possible to by setting the thickness of the p GaN contact layer to less than or equal to 260 nm in this case the thickness of the transparent p AlGaN contact layer is 40 nm completely suppress absorption of light by the p GaN contact layer so that the reflection effect due to the introduction of the reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure appears. As described above the transparent p AlGaN contact layer is present and has a certain thickness.

Further the relationship between the effect of suppressing absorption of light by the p GaN contact layer due to the introduction of the reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure and the thicknesses of the p GaN contact layer and the transparent p AlGaN contact layer was also compared and studied for a case where the order m of the Bragg scattering conditions as a parameter of the photonic crystal periodic structure was set to 3 Table 10 . In this case the radius R of the circular hole was set to 89.5 nm the period a was set to 224 nm and the depth h was set to 390 nm so as to allow the thickness of only a portion which penetrates the p GaN contact layer and the transparent p AlGaN contact layer of the photonic crystal periodic structure that is formed such that it penetrates all layers of from the Al reflecting electrode layer to the transparent p AlGaN contact layer to be greater than or equal to the period a as in the case where the order m of the Bragg scattering conditions is set to 4. The thickness of the p GaN contact layer was changed in increments of 50 nm in the range of 0 to 200 nm.

As is clear from Table 10 even when the order m is 3 it is considered that the advantageous effect of suppressing absorption of light by the p GaN contact layer due to the introduction of the reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure is expected to be achieved as long as the p GaN contact layer has a thickness that is less than about 50 nm.

The steps of specifically forming the photonic crystal periodic structures described in Examples 1 to 3 above using a nanoimprinting lithography method will be hereinafter described with reference to the drawings. Although an example of the photonic crystal periodic structure shown in which is formed such that it penetrates all layers of from the Al reflecting electrode layer to the transparent p AlGaN contact layer will be described the basic steps are the same even when the photonic crystal periodic structure that penetrates both the p GaN contact layer and the transparent p AlGaN contact layer is formed.

First a mold for accurately reproducing the photonic crystal periodic structure or which has been designed with any of the methods described in Examples 1 to 3 in the plurality of target layers is created. For the mold a resin mold is desirably used so that it can follow the warp of the substrate and the layers stacked thereon which would become prominent if the substrate size is increased.

It should be noted that photoresist used in the imprint technology of the nanoimprinting lithography method should have high fluidity so as to closely fill a mold with a fine projection recess structure pattern. However the fluidity will cause deterioration of the etching selectivity of the transparent p AlGaN contact layer . Thus a bi layer resist method which can provide both high fluidity and high etching selectivity is suitable for solving such a problem.

Specifically an organic resist material such as novolac resin which will improve the etching selectivity of the transparent p AlGaN contact layer is applied onto the Al reflecting electrode layer by a spin coater or the like for the stacked structure of the deep ultraviolet LED in which layers of up to the Al reflecting electrode layer have been stacked whereby an organic resist film is formed. Further silicon containing resist with high fluidity is applied onto the organic resist film to form a silicon containing resist film . The thickness of the silicon containing resist film is controlled so as to favorably secure the mold release characteristics of the mold taking into consideration the viscosity of the material and the like. Typically the silicon containing resist film may be thinner than the organic resist film .

The photonic crystal periodic structure or designed in accordance with any of Examples 1 to 3 is imprinted to the silicon containing resist film using the resin mold with the use of the nanoimprinting lithography method the basic structure of which is shown in . It should be noted that a silicon containing resist film remains in the recessed portions of the fine projection recess structure during imprint .

Next the silicon containing resist film that remains in the recessed portions is etched by plasma of oxygen containing gas and fluorine containing gas until the organic resist film is exposed. At this time the projection portions of the silicon containing resist film are also etched .

After that the silicon containing resist film is exposed to oxygen containing plasma to form a silicon oxide film and then a region of from the Al reflecting electrode layer up to the interface between the transparent p AlGaN contact layer and the p AlGaN layer is etched at a time by chlorine containing plasma with the silicon oxide film used as a mask . As the chlorine gas Cl BCl or the like is used. Using the chlorine containing plasma can secure high selectivity of the transparent p AlGaN contact layer with respect to the mask. Thus high accuracy processing with a high aspect ratio is possible. Finally the organic resist film and the silicon oxide film are removed by ashing .

Although this embodiment has illustrated an example of an AlGaN based deep ultraviolet LED Light Emitting Diode it can also be applied to optical semiconductor light emitting elements made of other materials as long as such light emitting elements have similar structures.

1 When the film thickness of the p GaN contact layer is about 200 nm it is possible to totally reflect incident light and suppress absorption and thus improve the total value of the LEE increase decrease rate by 10 or more as long as the depth of the photonic crystal is greater than or equal to 1 period.

2 In the case of 1 the Ni layer can be formed as thick as about 10 to 30 nm. Thus it is possible to obtain ohmic contact with the p GaN contact layer suppress an increase in the drive voltage and drastically improve the WPE.

3 In the case of 1 the degree of freedom of selection of the reflecting electrode material is increased.

4 A nanoimprinting method that uses bi layer resist can create a photonic crystal at a time such that it penetrates layers of from a reflecting electrode to a p GaN contact layer. Thus as it is not necessary to perform high precision positioning such as a liftoff process for fine patterns there is a significant advantage in the production cost.

A process such as simulation and control can be implemented by software processing with a CPU Central Processing Unit or a GPU Graphics Processing Unit or by hardware processing with an ASIC Application Specific Integrated Circuit or a FPGA Field Programmable Gate Array .
