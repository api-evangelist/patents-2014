Networks provide the ability for network connectable devices to communicate with one another. For example Internet of Things IoT systems allow communication among various IoT devices and or other devices. Many IoT systems provide a limited selection of devices that can interface with one another such as devices that share a common source and or manufacturer devices that operate using a common proprietary connection protocol or interface devices that have built in communications capabilities or the like. Typically IoT systems enable only simple interactions between devices oftentimes allowing only a single layer of processing and or communication. IoT systems that may enable more complex interactions between devices tend to only allow devices to communicate with other devices that share a common proprietary connection protocol or interface.

Techniques and systems are described for providing a common messaging system or interface that allows various devices to exchange machine to machine instant messages in real time or near real time. For example the common messaging system may be implemented by one or more network servers and may allow a device to exchange communications or messages with another device regardless of whether the devices are built by different manufacturers operate using different connection protocols or interfaces or whether the devices are built with the ability to communicate with a network. In some examples the common messaging system may operate using multiple connection protocols that may be used by different devices. The multiple connection protocols may be referred to herein as native connection protocols of the common messaging system. In some examples the common messaging system may include a universal application programming interface that is available for use by all of the native protocols. The common messaging system can route messages to and from any connected device in any supported protocol whether native or transformed by a plug in as described below . The common messaging system may translate between the different native protocols to facilitate message exchanges between devices that operate using different ones of the native connection protocols. For example the common messaging system may translate a received communication that is in a first native connection protocol to a second native connection protocol before sending the communication to a device that only operates using the second native connection protocol.

In some examples the common messaging system may interact with a universal interface that is built into a device. The built in universal interface allows the device to perform operations that native firmware of the device does not allow it to perform. In some embodiments the built in universal interface may include an operating system that allows the device to communicate with the common messaging system. For example the universal interface may override the native firmware of the device to allow the device to perform various operations.

In some examples devices may communicate with the common messaging system using a messaging system gateway that is connected to a same local area network or personal area network as the devices. For example the messaging system gateway may be located within a user s home and multiple devices within the user s home may connect to the messaging system gateway using one or more connection protocols. The messaging system gateway may operate as an intermediary between the common messaging system and the devices on the local area network or personal area network communicating with the common messaging system for each of the devices and communicating with the devices for the common messaging system. In some embodiments the messaging system gateway may include one or more messaging system plug ins. In some examples a messaging system plug in may translate or convert one or more non native connection protocols to a native connection protocol of the common messaging system. In some examples a messaging system plug in may also translate or map one or more proprietary application programming interfaces of devices to the universal application programming interface of the common messaging system. In some cases one or more of the devices themselves may include a messaging system plug in.

In some examples devices may communicate with the common messaging system using a mobile messaging system gateway that is installed on a mobile device. For example the mobile messaging system gateway may be installed on a user s mobile device. One or more devices within proximity to the mobile device may communicate with the mobile messaging system gateway using one or more connection protocols. Like the messaging system gateway the mobile messaging system gateway may operate as an intermediary between the common messaging system and the devices. The mobile messaging system gateway may include one or more messaging system plug ins.

Devices may be assigned a unique identifier and a token. In some embodiments one or more components or programs of a device may also be assigned a unique identifier e.g. a universally unique identifier UUID and a token. In some cases the unique identifier and or token for the components of a device may be the same as the unique identifier and or token of the device itself. In some embodiments components of a device that may be assigned a unique identifier may include a sensor e.g. a camera motion sensor temperature sensor accelerometer gyroscope or any other available sensor an output e.g. a microphone siren display light tactile output or any other available output a third party messaging service that the device is able to run or any other component of a device that can be identified accessed and or controlled. Using the common messaging system the universal interface and or the messaging system gateway devices that have assigned unique identifiers can query a vast network of devices for one or more devices that meet specific search criteria and can message or otherwise communicate with the devices.

In some embodiments multiple cloud servers with instances of a common messaging system may be created with multiple servers or other systems each operating an instance of software that includes a common messaging system. In some embodiments a particular instance of messaging system may have its own unique identifier that allows the instance of messaging system to connect to another instance of messaging system thus forming a mesh network of messaging systems. Other networks and devices or machines may also be part of the mesh network such as local area networks and personal area networks and the devices or machines that are interconnected using the local area networks and personal area networks. Each of the local area networks and personal area networks can have their own unique identifier and or token allowing the networks to be addressable using their unique identifier and also allowing them to address other unique identifiers around the world. Such a mesh network may allow messages and other payloads to be routed between devices and systems across cloud networks with instances of common messaging systems. Each person device or machine system or components thereof can be referenced by a common messaging system using its unique identifier. Each of the unique identifiers can discover other unique identifiers e.g. clouds other networks people or devices or machines using one or more queries and the common messaging system universal interface messaging system gateway and or mobile messaging system gateway can enable messages to be exchanged between unique identifiers.

In some embodiments the common messaging system may also allow a device built without the ability to communicate with a network to connect to other devices that are located remotely from the device. For example the common messaging system may allow serially connected devices that are located remote from one another to communicate. The serially connected devices may not be configured to communicate directly with the common messaging system. For example the serially connected devices may not be equipped with a wireless transceiver or with a wired port that allows the devices to communicate with a network. The serially connected devices may serially connect to another device that can connect with the messaging system e.g. a personal computer a lap top a tablet a serial phone line or the like . For example the common messaging system may bind sessions of first and second serially connected devices together to create a virtual serial cable connection that extends to two remote locations of the first and second serially connected devices. Each of the serially connected devices may be assigned a unique identifier and token. The messaging system may convert the serial input communication from the first serially connected device to a communication in the native protocol of the messaging system and may process the input using the universal application programming interface. The messaging system may convert the communication back to serial on the output before sending the communication to the second serially connected device. Accordingly a first serially connected device can communicate with another serially connected device over the cloud network of the common messaging system by sending serial communications to the messaging system.

The term machine readable storage medium or computer readable storage medium includes but is not limited to portable or non portable storage devices optical storage devices and various other mediums capable of storing containing or carrying instruction s and or data. A machine readable storage medium or computer readable storage medium may include a non transitory medium in which data can be stored and that does not include carrier waves and or transitory electronic signals propagating wirelessly or over wired connections. Examples of a non transitory medium may include but are not limited to a magnetic disk or tape optical storage media such as compact disk CD or digital versatile disk DVD flash memory memory or memory devices. A computer program product may include code and or machine executable instructions that may represent a procedure a function a subprogram a program a routine a subroutine a module a software package a class or any combination of instructions data structures or program statements. A code segment may be coupled to another code segment or a hardware circuit by passing and or receiving information data arguments parameters or memory contents. Information arguments parameters data etc. may be passed forwarded or transmitted via any suitable means including memory sharing message passing token passing network transmission etc.

Furthermore embodiments may be implemented by hardware software firmware middleware microcode hardware description languages or any combination thereof.

A processor s may perform the necessary tasks.

Systems depicted in some of the figures may be provided in various configurations. In some embodiments the systems may be configured as a distributed system where one or more components of the system are distributed across one or more networks in a cloud computing system.

Networks provide the ability for network connectable devices to communicate with one another. For example Internet of Things IoT systems allow communication among various IoT devices and or other devices. An IoT system may provide only a limited selection of devices that can interface with one another using the IoT system. For example devices that can utilize an IoT system may be limited to devices that share a common source and or manufacturer devices that operate using a common proprietary connection protocol or interface devices that have built in communications capabilities and or the like. Limiting the types of devices that can communicate using a specific IoT system constrains the types of functions that can be performed by the devices. For example a motion sensor built by a manufacture and that uses a first connection protocol may not be capable of communicating with a burglary alarm system built by a different manufacturer and that uses a second connection protocol. Furthermore vendors that may provide the ability for devices that use different proprietary protocols to communicate have to go through each device s proprietary application programming interface to facilitate message exchange between the devices. For example a server may receive a message from a first device that uses a first proprietary connection protocol and application programming interface that is destined for a second device that uses a second proprietary connection protocol and application programming interface. The server must send the message to the proprietary cloud server with which the second device is controlled and the proprietary cloud server accesses the application programming interface used by the second device and sends the message to the second device. The requirement of the server to go through the proprietary cloud server for the message to the sent to the second device adds latency to the message transport from the first device to the second device. Accordingly techniques and systems are described for providing a common messaging system or interface that allows various devices to exchange machine to machine instant messages regardless of whether the devices are built by different manufacturers operate using different connection protocols or interfaces or whether the devices are built with the ability to communicate with a network.

The system may include one or more remote servers or clouds that are in communication with other devices or systems via a network such as the Internet an intranet a LAN a PAN or a WAN. For example the system includes a common messaging system or messaging system that supports machine to machine instant message exchange in real time or near real time. In some embodiments the messaging system may be an open source machine to machine messaging platform enabling IoT devices other devices or machines and or systems to message or otherwise communicate with any other IoT devices other devices or machines and or systems. The messaging system may be implemented by one or more remote servers and may allow a IoT device other device or machine and or a system to exchange communications or messages with another device or system regardless of whether the devices or systems are built by different manufacturers operate using different connection protocols or interfaces or whether the devices or systems are built with the ability to communicate with a network. While only a single messaging system is shown one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that multiple private or public messaging systems may be implemented using the techniques described herein. One or more remote servers of the messaging system may be connected to a network via the Internet and or other connection platforms e.g. a WAN and or a LAN such that the servers may be accessed from anywhere in the world. The remote servers allow IoT devices other devices or machines and or systems connected to the servers via the network to communicate and exchange messages with other IoT devices other devices or machines and or systems from anywhere in the world. The remote servers may be configured with enough processing power to run an application store and process data and or perform any other computing task. In some examples the remote servers may provide enough processing power to operate applications running on devices located remotely from the servers and applications running on the servers themselves.

Messaging system may be configured to support multiple connection protocols such as any suitable machine to machine connection protocol. For example the messaging system may support connection protocols such as hypertext transfer protocol HTTP websockets message queuing telemetry transport MQTT constrained application protocol CoAP Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol XMPP Simple Network Management Protocol SNMP AllJoyn and or any other suitable connection protocol. The multiple connection protocols supported by the messaging system may be referred to herein as native connection protocols of the messaging system . Messaging system may also support multiple developer platforms such as one or more software developer kits SDKs . For example the messaging system may support SDKs such as Node.JS JavaScript Python Ruby or any other suitable SDK. The support of multiple developer platforms and protocols provides programmers with the flexibility to customize functions instructions and commands for IoT devices other devices or machines and or systems connected to messaging system .

The messaging system may include a cloud infrastructure system that provides cloud services. In certain embodiments services provided by the cloud infrastructure of messaging system may include a host of services that are made available to users of the cloud infrastructure system on demand such as registration access control and message routing for users devices or machines systems or components thereof. Services provided by the messaging system can be dynamically scaled to meet the demands of users. The messaging system may comprise one or more computers servers and or systems. In some embodiments the computers servers and or systems that make up the cloud network of the messaging system are different from a user s own on premises computers servers and or systems. For example the cloud network may host an application and a user may via a communication network such as a WAN LAN and or PAN on demand order and use the application. In some embodiments the cloud network of the messaging system may host a Network Address Translation Traversal application to establish a secure connection between the messaging system and a device or machine. A separate secure connection e.g. using a native protocol of the messaging system may be established by each device or machine for communicating with the messaging system . In certain embodiments the cloud network of the messaging system may include a suite of applications middleware or firmware that can be accessed by a user device or machine system or component thereof.

Upon registering with the messaging system each device or machine person and or system may be assigned a unique identifier and a security token. For example a device IoT or other device or system connected to the messaging system a person associated with an account or an application that utilizes the messaging system or the like may be assigned or otherwise provided with a distinct universally unique identifier UUID and or a distinct security token. Each IoT device other device or machine system and or person using a device must communicate its distinct UUID and security token to the messaging system in order to access the messaging system . The messaging system may authenticate the IoT device other device or machine system and or person using each respective distinct UUID and token. The messaging system may use the UUIDs to process route and or otherwise manage messages and other communications to an appropriate device person system and or machine. For example a device may send a message with its UUID and a destination UUID for the device system or person to which the message is destined. The messaging system may process route and or otherwise manage the message so that it is received at the appropriate destination.

In some embodiments one or more components or programs of a device or system may also be assigned a unique identifier and a security token. In some cases the unique identifier and or token for the components of a device or system may be the same as the unique identifier and or token of the device or system itself. In some cases the unique identifier and or token for a component or program of a device or system may be different from that of the device or system and may be unique only to the component or program. In some embodiments components of a device or system that may be assigned a unique identifier may include a sensor e.g. a camera motion sensor temperature sensor accelerometer gyroscope or any other available sensor an output e.g. a microphone siren display light tactile output or any other available output a third party messaging service that the device or system is able to run or any other component of a device or system that can be identified accessed and or controlled.

Messaging system may further be configured to interact with any application programming interface API . Each API may also be assigned or otherwise provided with a unique identifier e.g. a distinct UUID and or a security token. Assigning APIs with a unique identifier enables messaging system to receive instructions from and provide instructions to any IoT device other device or machine and or system that is connected to the messaging system . Further details describing how the messaging system can interact with any API of any device or system are described herein. By being able to interact with any API messaging system may control the functionality of all components of a registered IoT device other device or machine and or system that are accessible by the messaging system . In some embodiments messaging system may be configured such that a single message transmitted by messaging system may be communicated to multiple devices and or systems having different APIs. Accessible IoT devices other devices or machines and or systems include any device that has been registered with messaging system and that has been assigned a unique identifier and or a security token. For example a user may purchase an IoT device. The user must register the IoT device with the messaging system and may be assigned a UUID and security token by the messaging system to make the IoT device accessible to the messaging system .

Using the common messaging system people devices systems and or components thereof that have assigned UUIDs can query and communicate with a network of other people devices system and components thereof that have assigned UUIDs and that meet specific search criteria. For example a device may query the common messaging system searching for a specific type of devices that are located in a particular area and may receive a list of UUIDs for devices that meet the search criteria. The device may then send a message with a destination UUID assigned to the destination device to which the device wants to send a message.

In some embodiments messaging system may also detect connect and or communicate with other servers allowing messaging system to route messages to IoT devices other devices or machines and or systems on the other servers via a server to server connection. Server to server communications may include connections used to transfer data from one server to another server. For example a user may use multiple cloud servers to store different types of information. A user may want to transfer data from a first server of a first cloud network to a second server of a second cloud network. A server to server communication allows the user to directly transfer or otherwise share this information with the second server. As another example the messaging system supports inter cloud communications to allow people devices or machines systems or components thereof to route messages across clouds to other people devices or machines systems or components thereof on other clouds. For instance a device connected to a private or public cloud network may send a message to another device connected to another private or public cloud.

IoT devices other devices or machines and or systems may be able to connect with the messaging system in several ways. In some embodiments devices and systems may communicate with the messaging system using a messaging system gateway. For example IoT devices other devices or machines and or systems may communicate with the messaging system using messaging system gateway or hub . The messaging system gateway may be connected to a same LAN as the devices that use the messaging system gateway . For example the messaging system gateway may be installed at a location such as a home office a sports venue an outside environment e.g. a park a city or the like or any other suitable location. In some embodiments the messaging system gateway includes an instance of messaging system software that is configured to interact with the messaging system . In some cases the messaging system gateway may be run on an operating system such as but not limited to Linux Mac OS and or Windows . In some embodiments a messaging system gateway may be a standalone physical device such as a wireless router or modem which runs the gateway software that connects to the messaging system using a WAN. In some embodiments a messaging system gateway may be integrated into an IoT device other device or machine and or system by installing the gateway software onto the IoT device other device or machine and or system. For example the messaging system gateway may be run on computing devices such as a Raspberry Pi a home and or office computer Intel Galileo Beagle Bones Yuns and or other suitable computing device.

Regardless of physical form the messaging system gateway may operate as an intermediary between the messaging system and the devices or systems that use the messaging system gateway . For example IoT devices other devices or machines and or systems may be connected to messaging system gateway which then links the IoT devices other devices or machines and or systems to the messaging system in real time. The connection of a device or system to the messaging system via the messaging system gateway allows connected IoT devices other devices or machines and or systems to communicate with one another in real time. IoT devices other devices or machines and or systems may be connected to messaging system gateway using one or more native connection protocols of the IoT device other device or machine and or system. The protocols may include but are not limited to Transmission Control Protocol TCP User Datagram Protocol UDP WiFi ZigBee Bluetooth low energy BLE HTTP websockets MQTT CoAP XMPP SNMP AllJoyn and or any other suitable connection protocol. In some embodiments messaging system gateway may broadcast a private network signal such that registered devices and systems may securely connect to the messaging system gateway and to the messaging system . Devices and systems that do not have access to the messaging system gateway and messaging system may be unable to process the private network signal.

In some embodiments messaging system gateway is on a LAN side of a firewall such as a network address translations NAT firewall implemented using a router or other suitable firewall. In some cases the messaging system gateway may use websockets to connect to the messaging system . The connection between websockets of the messaging system gateway and the messaging system may include a bi directional persistent connection. The bi directional persistent connection may auto reconnect as WAN e.g. Internet or the like connectivity becomes available. By locating the messaging system gateway inside of the firewall only communications to and from the messaging system gateway have to be granted access to the firewall. Accordingly the messaging system and any system and or device connected to the messaging system gateway may communicate through the firewall via the messaging system gateway . The messaging system gateway may be used by a person or business to connect various IoT devices other devices or machines and or systems to the messaging system serving as a secure connection for communicating with messaging system much like a personal firewall.

Devices and systems may also be able to communicate with the messaging system using a mobile messaging system gateway that is installed on a mobile device. For example IoT devices other devices or machines and or systems may be able to connect with the messaging system using a mobile gateway . The mobile gateway is similar to a messaging system gateway but instead is installed and operated on a mobile device. For example mobile gateway may be installed on a mobile phone tablet laptop wearable device or other suitable mobile device. The mobile gateway may allow the mobile phone to connect to the messaging system . The mobile gateway may access all sensors on the mobile device. For example geolocation sensor data compass headings and or accelerometer data of a mobile phone may be provided to the messaging system through mobile gateway . In some embodiments the mobile gateway may be installed in wearable technology such as pedometers headsets watches and the like as well as in Bluetooth low energy devices. In some embodiments the mobile gateway may also provide a personal area network PAN and may allow other devices that are connectable to the mobile device to connect to the messaging system via the mobile gateway . For example one or more devices that do not have an Internet Protocol address and that are not able to connect to a LAN e.g. a WiFi network or the like may connect to the mobile gateway using a wired interface or a short range communication protocol interface such as Bluetooth BLE Zigbee near field communication NFC radio frequency RF infrared IR or any other suitable communication protocol. These devices may then connect to messaging system through the mobile gateway of the mobile device. The mobile gateway may operate to exchange communications between the devices and the messaging system . Devices that do not have an Internet Protocol address and that are not able to connect to a local area network may include wearable technology or other similar devices that only have access to a PAN.

In some embodiments an IoT device other device or machine and or system may connect with messaging system the messaging system gateway and or the mobile gateway using a universal messaging system interface that is programmed into the device or system. The built in universal messaging system interface or universal interface allows a device or system to perform operations that native firmware of the device or system does not allow it to perform. For example the messaging system interface may override the native firmware of a device to allow the device to perform various operations that are outside of the functionality of the native firmware. In some embodiments the messaging system interface may be installed on a device that does not have the ability to communicate with other devices using one or more connection protocols. In such embodiments the messaging system interface may provide the device with the capability to use one or more connection protocols. The messaging system interface may access one or more sensors inputs outputs or programs on the device or system in order to perform various operations. For example the messaging system interface may have access to and control a geolocation sensor a compass a camera a motion sensor a temperature sensor an accelerometer a gyroscope a graphical interface input a keypad input a touchscreen input a microphone a siren a display a light a tactile output a third party messaging service that the device or system is able to run or any other component of a device or system that can be identified accessed and or controlled.

In some embodiments the built in universal messaging system interface may include an operating system that allows the device to communicate with the messaging system . Messaging system interface may be installed on an IoT device other device or machine and or system such as a computing device. For example the messaging system interface may be installed on a Raspberry Pi board an Arduino board a microcontroller a minicomputer or any other suitable computing device.

In some embodiments a device or system running the messaging system interface may connect directly to messaging system . In some embodiments a device or system running the messaging system interface may connect to the messaging system via the messaging system gateway or the mobile gateway . The messaging system interface run by the device or system may be assigned a UUID and a token. The messaging system interface may connect to the messaging system using the assigned UUID and token and may await further instructions from the messaging system . In some embodiments the messaging system may act as a compute server that controls the messaging system interface . For example messaging system may activate and or deactivate pins of the computing device running the messaging system interface request sensor data from the computing device and or cause the messaging system interface to perform other functions related to the computing device. In some embodiments the messaging system interface can be connected to a gateway e.g. messaging system gateway or mobile gateway and the gateway may act as a compute server that controls the messaging system interface in a similar manner as described above. In some embodiments messaging system interface may be a mobile operating system or application that is able to run on mobile device operating systems such as iOS and Android operating systems.

Information from messaging system including information transmitted to messaging system by messaging system gateway mobile gateway and or messaging system interface may be transmitted to one or more data storage systems. For example information about IoT devices other devices or machines and or systems registered with the messaging system may be transmitted to device directory for storage. The information about the IoT device other device or machine and or system may be stored in device directory upon registration of the IoT device other device or machine and or system. For example information related to when the IoT device other device or machine and or system comes online or offline may be stored in device directory .

In some embodiments the device directory may maintain various lists such as whitelists and or blacklists that are associated with a unique identifier e.g. a UUID assigned a person an IoT device other device or machine system and or component thereof. The use of whitelists and blacklists ensures that devices systems and users only have access to those UUIDs of IoT devices other devices or machines and or systems for which permission has been granted. In one example the device directory may maintain a whitelist for a UUID assigned to a device. The whitelist includes a list or array of UUIDs assigned to devices or systems that are allowed access the device at various levels of access. For example four levels of access to the device may be granted to other devices or systems and a separate list or array may be maintained for each level of access. In this example the whitelist for the device s UUID may include a list or array that includes UUIDs of devices or systems that may discover the device a list or array of UUIDs of devices or systems that may send a message to the device a list or array of UUIDs of devices or systems that may receive a message from the device and or a list or array of UUIDs of devices or systems that may configure the device. Other levels of access may also be granted such as the ability of another device or system to subscribe to the device.

In another example the device directory may also maintain a blacklist for a UUID assigned to the device. The blacklist includes a list or array of UUIDs assigned to devices or systems that are denied access to the device at the various levels of access. In this example the blacklist for the device s UUID may include a list or array that includes UUIDs of devices or systems that cannot discover the device a list or array of UUIDs of devices or systems that cannot send a message to the device a list or array of UUIDs of devices or systems that cannot receive a message from the device and or a list or array of UUIDs of devices or systems that cannot configure the device.

In some embodiments the device directory is queriable such that a device system or user may be provided with a list and or array of IoT devices other devices or machines and or systems that fit requested search criteria. The messaging system may access the device directory upon receiving a query from a device system or user. Upon polling the device directory according to the criteria specified in a query the messaging system may provide a device with a list or array of UUIDs assigned to IoT devices other devices or machines and or systems that are currently online and that the device has access to according to the device s UUID and or security token. The use of the whitelists and or blacklists operates as a security feature ensuring that devices systems and users only have access to other devices systems and users to which permission has been granted.

In some embodiments sensor data from sensors of registered IoT devices other devices or machines and or systems may be transmitted to sensor data storage . The sensor data may be streamed from a registered IoT device other device or machine and or system through messaging system in real time. Sensor data storage is queriable such that a user may poll sensor data storage to receive data from specified sensors during a specified time period. A user may also be able to query the sensor data storage for all available data from one or more sensors. In some embodiments information from sensor data storage as well as additional information from messaging system may be transmitted to an analytics database . In some embodiments analytics database may not be queried by a user of the system . In other embodiments analytics database may be queried by a user of the system . The information stored in analytics database may be accessible via a platform network .

In some embodiments multiple servers or other systems may each operate an instance of software that includes the messaging system thus creating multiple cloud servers and or instances of messaging systems . In some embodiments a particular instance of messaging system may have its own UUID that allows the instance of messaging system to connect to another instance of messaging system to form a mesh network of messaging systems. Other networks and devices or machines may also be part of the mesh network such as LANs and PANs and the devices or machines that are interconnected using the LANs and PANs. Each of the LANs and PANs can have their own unique UUID and or token registered with the messaging system . The LANs and PANs are addressable using their unique UUID and can also address other UUIDs around the world. Such a mesh network may allow messages and other payloads to be routed between devices across messaging systems . Accordingly the messaging system supports inter cloud communications to allow people devices or machines systems or components thereof to route messages across clouds to other people devices or machines systems or components thereof on other clouds. Each of the cloud networks may run an instance of the messaging system . For instance a device connected to a private or public cloud network may send a message to another device connected to another private or public cloud.

As described above each person device or machine system e.g. cloud network running an instance of the messaging system a LAN a PAN or the like or components thereof that is registered with the messaging system is assigned a UUID. Each person device or machine system or components thereof can be referenced by the messaging system using its UUID. Each of the UUIDs can discover other UUIDs e.g. clouds other networks people or devices or machines using one or more queries such as using multicast Domain Name System MDNS or API queries. In some embodiments a UUID can connect to multiple networks thus forming a global mesh network including different networks e.g. multiple cloud networks LANs PANs or a combination of cloud networks LANs and or PANs . A cloud network running an instance of messaging system may also be assigned an UUID and can route messages across cloud networks via inter cloud communications using a routing paradigm. For example a cloud network can send a message across cloud networks by sending the message with a route UUID1 UUID2 UUID3 UUID4 with each UUID be assigned to a different cloud network. In some embodiments the mesh network may route the message based on known connections.

Platform network may include one or more analytics engines that may process the information received from the analytics database . The analytics engines may aggregate the received information detect trends and or perform other analytics on the information. Platform network may be communicatively coupled with a number of APIs that are used to create manage identify and or communicate with functions of different IoT devices other devices or machines and or systems. APIs may include for example sales analytics APIs social media account and other third party messaging account APIs stock quote APIs weather service APIs other data APIs mobile application APIs and any other suitable API. For example a Facebook or other social media message may use a messaging API to send SMS messages. Platform network may use the messaging API to deliver a payload to a device or system configured to display a SMS message. A light API may be provided by a manufacturer of smart light bulbs. The platform network would then use this light API to provide an output to turn a light bulb connected to the platform network on or off. Platform network is also in communication with messaging system using the APIs of messaging system . Platform network may interact with the IoT devices other devices or machines and or systems connected through the messaging system using UUIDs and or security tokens.

The UUIDs and or security tokens may be issued by the messaging system and or the platform network . In some embodiments a user may register systems and or devices with the messaging system . The platform network may import or otherwise utilize any UUIDs and or tokens issued by the messaging system during the registration. In some embodiments a user may register devices and or systems with the platform network . The platform network may issue UUIDs and security tokens to IoT devices other devices or machines and or systems upon registration of the IoT device other device or machine and or system. The UUIDs and security tokens are used to access the messaging system as described above. In some embodiments a user may register devices and or systems with both the messaging system and the platform network . Either messaging system or platform network may issue UUIDs and or tokens. Registration with the non issuing system or network creates a link or other association with the issued UUIDs and or security tokens.

Platform network may operate an application or other program that provides a designer graphical interface that allows a user to create a control system or flow. The designer graphical interface may allow the user to create a control system by dragging and dropping blocks that represent various devices and or systems of the control system inputs and or outputs from the various devices and or systems and or functions for controlling the devices and or systems. Any IoT device other device or machine and or system that is registered with platform network may be configured to receive or transmit a message to any other IoT device other device or machine and or system that is registered with platform network using an appropriate control system designed using the designer graphical interface. Messages may be transmitted from one device or system to control operation of another device or system. For example the platform network may run control systems continuously such that an input from a device or system may automatically cause an event to occur in a different location and or by a different device or system. Such functionality along with access to the data from analytics database enables the platform network to monitor a performance behavior and or state of any IoT device other device or machine and or system within the control system and to send a resulting message or payload to any other IoT device other device or machine and or system in the control system based on the monitored performance behavior and or state. In another example the platform network may run a control system designed using the designer graphical interface upon receiving a command such as from a user or from another device or system. In some embodiments the designer graphical interface operated by the platform network may access any IoT device other device or machine and or system connected to messaging system including IoT devices other devices or machines and or systems connected using the messaging system gateway messaging system interface and or mobile gateway . This connection enables control systems created using the designer graphical interface to control output functions of devices and or systems registered with the messaging system . For example real time monitoring of data at a remote location such as performance of a machine or system or of a person s health condition may be performed by the platform network .

The platform network may also automatically provide messages or other outputs including commands to any of the registered IoT devices other devices or machines and or systems based on processes performed on information received from IoT devices other device or machine and or system. For example sensor data may be received from an IoT device and processed by analytics systems of the platform network . Using artificial intelligence and or machine learning within the platform network the processed sensor data may be used to provide commands to another system or device connected to platform network .

In some embodiments platform network may be connected with messaging system through a web based design interface . Web based design interface may include similar functionality as the designer of platform network but operates as a web based application. Users may design control systems and flows on web based design interface and test the control systems prior to fully deploying a control system into platform network . Users may have access to all IoT devices other devices or machines and or systems associated with messaging system and or platform network although the processing functions available using the web based design interface are limited to those provided by a web browser. Web based design interface may act as a developer design tool that functions through the capabilities of the web browser. A user may then import the control system into platform network for continuous operation of the control system.

Devices or machines systems or components thereof that are each assigned individual UUIDs may continuously stream data e.g. sensor data to the messaging system . The streamed data may be stored in device directory sensor data storage and or to the analytics database . The streamed data from the UUIDs may be reacted upon in real time. As described in more detail below UUIDs or user control system or flow created using the platform network can subscribe to other UUIDs streaming the data. Based on thresholds within the data frequency of occurrence of certain data or the occurrence of the data itself events can be created that trigger messages to be exchanged between devices or machines and or systems. For example a photo sensor with an assigned UUID that senses a change in light may stream sensor data to the messaging system and a control system created using the platform network may indicate that anytime a change in light occurs a light with an assigned UUID should be turned on or off. The control system may subscribe to the UUID of the sensor so that it can detect when a change in light occurs. When the control system senses a light change it may trigger a message to be sent to the light in order to cause the light to change states e.g. on or off . In some examples the sensor data and message exchanges or other transactions may be streamed into the analytics database for real time near real time and or offline data analytics.

In some embodiments UUIDs can subscribe to other UUIDs with or without tokens provided security permissions allow it . Subscribing with the device s UUID with a token allow a person device or system to spy on the device s inbound and outbound communications in an eavesdropping mode. Subscribing without the device s token may only allow the subscribing device access to the messages broadcast by the device provided security permissions allow it .

The system may further include one or more messaging system interfaces implemented by one or more machines or devices. For example the system includes messaging system interface messaging system interface messaging system interface and messaging system interface . The messaging system interfaces may be similar to the messaging system interface described above with respect to and may perform one or more of the functions described above. The messaging system interfaces may each be installed on a separate computing device and integrated with a separate machine or device. For example the messaging system interfaces or may be installed on a computing device such as a Raspberry Pi board an Arduino board a microcontroller a minicomputer or any other suitable computing device. The computing devices with the installed messaging system interfaces or may then be integrated with separate devices or machines. Accordingly four machines may each be integrated with a computing device installed with one of the messaging system interfaces and . Devices or machines can include any electronic device including sensors and consumer products such as light bulbs thermostats home automation devices smoke alarms burglary alarms an accelerator or other electronic component of a vehicle a display device a printer or any other electronic device.

The system may further include one or more messaging system gateways including a messaging system gateway and a mobile gateway not shown . The messaging system gateway may be similar to the messaging system gateway described above with respect to and may perform one or more of the functions described above. In some embodiments the messaging system gateway may include a mobile gateway similar to the mobile gateway described above with respect to . The messaging system gateway may be connected to a local area network LAN and or to a personal area network PAN .

Any machine that has been assigned a unique identifier e.g. a UUID by the messaging system or messaging system and that has the ability to connect to a wide area network WAN e.g. an IoT device can connect directly to the messaging system . In some embodiments only the messaging system issues unique identifiers to people machines or devices systems or components thereof. In such embodiments the messaging system may use the unique identifiers that are issued by the messaging system . In some embodiments the messaging systems and are independent messaging systems and each messaging systems and may issue different unique identifiers. Machines with or without unique identifiers can connect to the messaging system gateway . A machine with an assigned unique identifier and the appropriate access level permission can query the network from anywhere in the world for other machines that meet a specific search criteria. The machine may message the other machines via the messaging system .

The messaging systems and support inter cloud communications allowing machines to route messages across the messaging systems and to devices and sub devices on other cloud networks. For example the machine running the messaging system interface is connected to the private messaging system cloud network and can send a message to a machine running the messaging system interface that is connected to the public messaging system . The machine running the messaging system interface may be located in New York N.Y. and the machine running the messaging system interface may be located in London England. The machine running the messaging system interface may send the message to a route of UUIDs corresponding to the path that the message must follow in order to reach the machine running the messaging system interface . The route may be included in a routing list that is included in the message e.g. in a field of the message such as a header field . For example the routing list for the message may include a route of UUIDs that includes UUID MSGSYS UUID MSGSYS UUID MSGSYSINT. The messaging system may assign the UUID MSGSYS to the messaging system the UUID MSGSYS to itself and the UUID MSGSYSINT to the machine running the messaging system interface . The network servers of the messaging systems and the messaging system gateway and the machines or devices running the messaging system interfaces if included in the route may each remove their UUID from the routing list and pass the message on to the next UUID in the list until the message arrives at its destination. The same routing technique may be used to send messages within the same messaging system cloud network or across multiple messaging system cloud networks.

In some embodiments devices or machines can also communicate with other devices or machines via one or more peer to peer sockets rather than going through a messaging system or . For example the machine running the messaging system interface may directly communicate with the machine running the messaging system interface . One or more dynamic routing protocols may be used by the machines when exchanging communications via a peer to peer connection. In some embodiments devices or machines may discover and be introduced to other devices or machines using the messaging system . After being introduced by the messaging system the devices or machines may then begin a peer to peer communications session directly provided they have the proper security permissions. For example the machine running the messaging system interface may query the messaging system for machines that meets certain criteria e.g. Philips Hue light bulbs in a particular location or other suitable search criteria . The messaging system may check the security permissions of the machine running the messaging system interface and may return a list or array of UUIDs assigned to machines that meet the criteria and for which the machine running the messaging system interface has permission to access. One of the machines on the list or array may include the machine running the messaging system interface . The machines running messaging system interfaces and may then begin a peer to peer communications session to directly exchange messages.

In some embodiments the messaging system may store various properties of each registered person machine or device system or component thereof that has an assigned UUID. Each registered person machine or device system or component thereof may have a registry store in which the properties may be stored. For example the registry store for each registered person machine or device system or component thereof may be stored in a device directory similar to the device directory described above. The properties can be anything that describes the person machine or device system or component thereof including status or state e.g. on off idle sleeping or the like type color features connection protocols geolocation or the like. For example one or more servers of the messaging system may track how each registered machine or device is connected to the messaging system or to a messaging system gateway e.g. gateway . The messaging system may also track the geolocation of each device or machine. For example the messaging system may store in a registry store for each machine or device the connection protocol used by each machine or device and the geolocation of each machine or device at a given point in time. The geolocation may be stored as a set of coordinates e.g. global positioning system GPS coordinates latitude longitude coordinates or the like . The connection protocol and the geolocation may be updated each time either changes. For example if a machine or device changes locations or connects with the messaging system using a different connection protocol the messaging system may update the machine s registry store with the updated connection protocol and or geolocation. In some embodiments the messaging system can store all of the connection protocols for which a machine or device is configured to operate. The properties may be updated in real time as the change occurs or in partial real time at different points in time e.g. every 1 minute 2 minutes 5 minutes 30 minutes 1 hour or other appropriate period of time .

The messaging systems and operate using one or more native connection protocols. For example the messaging systems and may natively recognize a HTTP connection protocol a websockets connection protocol a MQTT connection protocol a CoAP connection protocol an XMPP connection protocol a SNMP connection protocol an AllJoyn connection protocol or any other appropriate connection protocol. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the messaging systems and may natively operate using any other appropriate machine to machine connection protocol. Other protocols may be added to the messaging system or over time as the protocols become more universally used.

The messaging system may also include a universal application programming interface that is available for use by all of the native connection protocols of the messaging system . The universal application programming interface may be used to interface Internet Things IoT devices that use different proprietary application programming interfaces. The universal application programming interface allows the messaging system to avoid having to go through each machine s proprietary cloud network and proprietary application programming interface to facilitate message exchange between machines that use different proprietary protocols to communicate. Without a universal application programming interface a server may receive a message from a first device that is destined for a second device. The first device may use a first proprietary connection protocol and application programming interface and the second device may use a second proprietary connection protocol and application programming interface. The server would have to send the message to the proprietary cloud server with which the second device is registered. The proprietary cloud server would then access the application programming interface used by the second device and send the message to the second device. Such a procedure of sending the messages to a different proprietary cloud network using different application programming interface requests for each different proprietary protocol used adds latency to the message transport from the first device to the second device. Using the universal application programming interface the messaging system can receive messages from the first device and can directly send the messages to the second device or to a local gateway to which the second device is connected via a LAN or PAN using a single application programming interface request.

The universal application programming interface supports various commands. For example the universal application programming interface allows users machines or devices systems or components thereof to get a status of the messaging system e.g. online offline temporarily offline or the like . The universal application programming interface also allows a machine or device to be registered with the messaging system . Upon receiving a registration request the universal application programming interface may return a UUID and a security token to the registrant. The universal application programming interface also specifies how queries from users machines or devices systems or components thereof are handled. For example the universal application programming interface may allow the messaging system to return a list of UUIDs that correspond to a query for different users machines or devices systems or components thereof. As another example the universal application programming interface may allow the messaging system to return information related to a specific machine or device in response to a query for information relating to the machine or device. The universal application programming interface also describes how to update features of e.g. change a location connection protocol color or other feature or control e.g. turn on off move to a different location or the like registered machines or devices in response to requests from users machines or devices systems or components thereof to make the changes and that have permission to do so . One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the universal application programming interface can specify to the servers of the messaging system how to perform various generic functions that relate to any connected users machines or devices systems or components thereof.

One or more computing devices of the messaging system can route messages to and from any connected machine or device in any supported protocol whether native or transformed by a plug in as described below . The computing devices may include one or more network servers. The messaging system may translate between the different native connection protocols to facilitate message exchanges between machines or devices that operate using different connection protocols. For example the common messaging system may translate a received communication that is in a first native connection protocol to a second native connection protocol before sending the communication to a machine or device that only operates using the second native connection protocol or that operates using a connection protocol that is different than the first and second native connection protocols in which case a plug in would be needed to convert from the second native connection protocol to the protocol that the machine uses . In one example a MQTT device can use the messaging system to communicate a message to a CoAP device a websocket powered device or a web page via HTTP. The messaging system can thus interpret or translate the message to the destination device s connected or preferred connection protocol.

In one example a computing device may be used for interfacing Internet Things IoT devices that use different connection protocols. For example the computing device may be a network server of the messaging system and may include one or more data processors. The computing device may also include a receiver. A first IoT device may transmit a communication destined for a second IoT device across a WAN or to a messaging system gateway e.g. messaging system gateway via a LAN and or PAN. The first IoT device may include a messaging system interface. The receiver of the computing device may receive the communication from the first IoT device. The first IoT device may be communicatively connected to the computing device using a first connection protocol and the communication may be received using the first connection protocol. The first connection protocol may be a connection protocol that is native to the computing device of the messaging system . For example the first connection protocol may be a MQTT connection protocol.

The computing device may include a non transitory computer readable storage medium containing instructions that when executed on the one or more data processors cause the one or more processors to perform various operations. The computing device may determine a second IoT device to which the communication is intended to be transmitted. The computing device may also determine a second connection protocol used by the second IoT device. For example the first IoT device may be assigned a first UUID and the second IoT device may be assigned a second UUID. The received communication may include the second UUID e.g. in a field of a communication packet . The computing device may determine the identity of the second IoT device and the second connection protocol used by the second IoT device based on the second UUID. For example the computing device may refer to a registry store e.g. in the device directory of messaging system that is associated with the second UUID in order to determine the connection protocol used by the second IoT device. The computing device may then translate the communication to the second connection protocol that corresponds to the protocol with which the second IoT device is connected to the computing device of the messaging system . The first connection protocol is different than the second connection protocol. For example the second connection protocol may be a HTTP connection protocol. In some embodiments the first IoT device may not be configured to communicate using the second connection protocol and the second IoT device may not be configured to communicate using the first connection protocol.

The computing device may further include a transmitter for transmitting the communication to the second IoT device that is communicatively connected to the computing device using the second connection protocol. The communication is transmitted using the second connection protocol.

In some embodiments the receiver is configured to and may receive a response to the communication from the second IoT device. The response may be received using the second connection protocol with which the second IoT device is communicatively connected to the computing device. The computing device may then translate the response to the first connection protocol with which the first IoT device is communicatively connected to the computing device. The transmitter is configured to and may transmit the response to the first IoT device using the first connection protocol.

In some embodiments the receiver is configured to and may receive a second communication from a third party messaging account. The transmitter is configured to and may transmit the second communication to the second IoT device. The second communication received from the third party messaging account controls a function of the second IoT device. For example the third party messaging account may be an account of a third party messaging service such as Facebook Twitter LinkedIn SMS or any other messaging service that allows a user of a device to send and receive messages using a registered account. In some embodiments the second communication includes a message and a tag. The tag identifies a destination program of the second device such as an application or program that enables a machine or device to send messages using the third party messaging accounts. For example the tag may identify an identifier of the application or program. Upon being received by the application or program of the second device the destination application or program may be opened and the tagged data may be entered into the application or program to activate the indicated function.

In some embodiments the messaging system gateway may include one or more messaging system plug ins. In some embodiments one or more plug ins may be installed on one or more computing devices such as a microcontroller a minicomputer or any other suitable computing device in the messaging system gateway . In some embodiments one or more plug ins may be added to one or more existing programs of the messaging system gateway . In some examples each plug in may include program code that knows how to interact with the messaging system gateway . For example a plug in may include a JavaScript piece of code. In some examples when sending messages from a machine to the messaging system a messaging system plug in may translate or convert one or more connection protocols that are used by the machine and that are not native to the messaging system to a native connection protocol of the messaging system . When sending messages from the messaging system to the machine the messaging system plug in of the gateway may also translate the native connection protocols of the messaging system to the protocols used by the machine. In some examples a messaging system plug in may also translate or map one or more proprietary application programming interfaces used by a machine to a universal application programming interface of the messaging system . Similar plug ins may be used in a mobile gateway e.g. mobile gateway and may perform similar functions as those described herein. For example a mobile gateway may allow a user to interconnect various devices worn or carried by the user via a PAN provided by the mobile gateway as described above. One or more plug ins of the mobile gateway may allow the devices to communicate with the messaging system similar to the plug ins of the messaging system gateway .

To perform the translation a plug in may define a message schema that corresponds to the format of the messages required to communicate with a particular machine or device. For example a message with a command from the messaging system may instruct one or more machines to perform a function such as to turn off all lights in a room. The message may be transmitted in a general format of the universal application programming interface that is not specific to the proprietary application programming interfaces of the different machines. The message may also be transmitted by the messaging system using a connection protocol that is not used by the different machines. The proprietary application programming interfaces of the machines may only be configured to receive messages in a certain format and the message from the messaging system may not be in any of the specific formats. The one or more plug ins that are used to translate messages for the different machine may translate the message into the format that is required by each of the proprietary application programming interfaces. The plug ins may also transmit the message to the machines using the proprietary connection protocol for which the machines are configured to operate.

Accordingly the messaging system gateway supports an open plug in architecture that translates non native connection protocols such Phillips Hue Nest Belkin Wemo Insteon SmartThings or any other appropriate proprietary legacy or new connection protocols to native protocols and or to a universal application programming interface of the messaging system . In some cases one or more of the machines or devices themselves may include a messaging system plug in. Each machine or device that runs proprietary firmware and or that uses proprietary application programming interfaces can include one or more plug ins that translate the proprietary communications to and from the connection protocols used by the messaging system . The plug in architecture allows proprietary legacy e.g. RS 232 serial RF or the like and or new machines or devices e.g. BLE wearable devices or the like to be registered with and communicate with the messaging system regardless of the connection protocol natively used by the machines or devices.

The messaging system gateway may include multiple plug ins. For example a set of machines or devices may be connected to the messaging system gateway . Different plug ins may be used by different subsets of machines or devices that are connected to the messaging system gateway . The different subsets of machines may relate to different classes of devices. For example machines may be broken into classes based on a manufacturer of the devices a connection protocol and or application programming interface used by the devices or any other appropriate classification. Each of the devices that are connected to the messaging system gateway may be assigned to a logical sub device that the messaging system gateway keeps track of. The messaging system gateway may assign and map each logical sub device to a particular plug in. For example the messaging system gateway may store a record of all devices with the record of each connected device including a separate sub device and plug in combination. In one example three Philips Hue lights and two Nest smoke alarms may be connected to the messaging system gateway for communicating with the messaging system . The messaging system gateway may have a stored record for each device including five records. The three records for the three Philips Hue lights may each include a separate sub device e.g. sub device A sub device B sub device C and a plug in that is specifically configured to translate between the messaging system native connection protocols and application programming interfaces and the Philips Hue connection protocols and application programming interfaces. Similar records may be stored for the two Nest smoke alarms including two records storing a separate sub device for each smoke alarm e.g. sub device D sub device E and a plug in that is configured to translate between the messaging system native connection protocols and application programming interfaces and the Nest connection protocols and application programming interfaces. In some embodiments the messaging system gateway may include a single plug in that is configured to and may translate between multiple proprietary connection protocols and application programming interfaces.

In one example of the universal application programming interface a computing device may be provided with the universal application programming interface. The computing device may be included in a cloud network. For example the computing device may include one or more network servers of the messaging system . The computing device includes one or more data processors and a receiver for receiving a communication originating from a first IoT device. The first IoT device may use a first proprietary application programming interface and the communication may include a command for a second IoT device to perform. The command may be converted from a protocol corresponding to the first proprietary application programming interface to a universal protocol corresponding to the universal application programming interface. For example either the computing device of the messaging system or a plug in of a messaging system gateway e.g. messaging system gateway may convert the command to a format that is understood by the universal application programming interface as described above.

The computing device may include a non transitory computer readable storage medium containing instructions that when executed on the one or more data processors cause the one or more processors to perform various operations. The computing device may determine that the communication is to be transmitted to the second IoT device. For example the first IoT device may be assigned a first UUID and the second IoT device may be assigned a second UUID. The received communication may include the second UUID e.g. in a field of a communication packet . The computing device may determine the identity of the second IoT device based on the second UUID. The computing device may then cause a transmitter to transmit the communication including the command to the second IoT device. The second IoT device may use a second proprietary application programming interface. The command may be converted from the universal protocol corresponding to the universal application programming interface to a protocol corresponding to the second proprietary application programming interface. For example either the computing device of the messaging system or a plug in of a messaging system gateway e.g. messaging system gateway may convert the command to a format that is usable by the second proprietary application programming interface as described above.

In some embodiments the receiver is configured to and may receive a second communication from a third party messaging account. The transmitter is configured to and may transmit the second communication to the second IoT device. The second communication received from the third party messaging account controls a function of the second IoT device. For example the third party messaging account may be an account of a third party messaging service such as Facebook Twitter LinkedIn SMS or any other messaging service that allows a user of a device to send and receive messages using a registered account. In some embodiments the second communication includes a message and a tag. The tag identifies a destination program of the second device such as an application or program that enables a machine or device to send messages using the third party messaging accounts. For example the tag may identify an identifier of the application or program. Upon being received by the application or program of the second device the destination application or program may be opened and the tagged data may be entered into the application or program to activate the indicated function.

In some examples of using one or more plug ins a computing device may be provided for communicating with the universal application programming interface of the messaging system . In some embodiments the computing device may be included in the messaging system gateway and may execute the one or more plug ins. In some embodiments the computing device may be included in a mobile gateway e.g. mobile gateway and may execute the one or more plug ins. The computing device includes one or more data processors and a non transitory computer readable storage medium containing instructions which when executed on the one or more data processors cause the one or more processors to perform various operations. The computing device may receive a communication from a first proprietary application programming interface of a first IoT device. The communication may include a command for a second IoT device to perform. For example the first IoT device may include a smoke alarm and the second IoT device may include a lighting system controller connected to one or more lights. The first and second IoT devices may be connected to the computing device via a local area network a personal area network or a combination of a local area network and a personal area network. The command may include a message indicating that the smoke alarm has detected smoke and that the lighting system controller should turn on the one or more lights. The second IoT device may use the first proprietary application programming interface or a second proprietary application programming interface that is different than the first proprietary application programming interface. The computing device may convert the command from a protocol corresponding to the first proprietary application programming interface to a universal protocol corresponding to the universal application programming interface using the techniques described above. The computing device may further cause a transmitter to transmit the communication including the converted command to the universal application programming interface of the messaging system cloud network. The universal application programming interface may process the command determine the identity of the second IoT device and route the command to the appropriate networks or devices so that it can reach the second IoT device. The command may then be received by the second IoT device or a messaging system gateway connected to the second IoT device. A plug in of the messaging system gateway may then convert the command to a command that can be carried out by a proprietary application programming interface of the second IoT device.

The computing device may further receive a second communication from the universal application programming interface that includes a command for a third IoT device to perform. The third device may include another device connected to the computing device via the local area network the personal area network or a combination of the local area network and the personal area network. The third IoT device uses a third proprietary application programming interface. The computing device may convert the command of the second communication from the universal protocol corresponding to the universal application programming interface to a protocol corresponding to the third proprietary application programming interface used by the third IoT device. The computing device may then cause the transmitter to transmit the second communication including the converted command to the third IoT device.

In some embodiments the computing device determine a sub device that is mapped to the third IoT device. The computing device may route the second communication to the sub device mapped to the third IoT device and may determine a plug in that applies to the sub device. As described above the sub device is mapped to a particular plug in and can be used to identify the plug in to use to convert the command to the proprietary application programming interface.

In some embodiments the computing device may receive a third communication from the universal application programming interface. The third communication may include a message from a third party messaging account. The third communication from the third party messaging account controls a function of the second IoT device. For example the third party messaging account may be an account of a third party messaging service such as Facebook Twitter LinkedIn SMS or any other messaging service that allows a user of a device to send and receive messages using a registered account. In some embodiments the third communication includes a message and a tag. The tag identifies a destination program of the second device such as an application or program that enables a machine or device to send messages using the third party messaging accounts. For example the tag may identify an identifier of the application or program. Upon being received by the application or program of the second device the destination application or program may be opened and the tagged data may be entered into the application or program to activate the indicated function.

Working in combination the messaging system and the messaging system gateway and or a mobile gateway with the plug ins allow machines or devices to communicate with one another regardless of the proprietary nature of the connection protocols or application programming interfaces that are used by the machines or devices. In the example above including the three Philips Hue lights and two Nest smoke alarms a smoke alarm may communicate with one or more of the lights by sending messages to the messaging system via the messaging system gateway . For example when smoke is detected by the smoke alarm the smoke alarm may transmit a message to the messaging system gateway instructing all of the lights to turn on. A plug in of the messaging system gateway may translate the message from the proprietary Nest format to a generic native format used by the messaging system . The messaging system may determine a destination for the message by referring to one or more UUIDs that are included in the message. In some embodiments the messaging system may determine a destination based on a query included in the message. For example the message may indicate that the message is to be sent to all lights that are located within a particular geolocation e.g. within a certain distance from the smoke alarm . Once the messaging system determines that the destination for the message includes the three lights the messaging system may process the message using the universal application programming interface. For example the messaging system may authenticate the smoke alarm using its UUID and token combination and may determine the security permissions of the smoke alarm in order to verify that the smoke alarm has appropriate access to the lights e.g. that the smoke alarm is permitted to discover and send messages to the lights .

As previously described the system also includes messaging system interface messaging system interface messaging system interface and messaging system interface . The machines running the messaging system interfaces may directly connect with the messaging system or may connect with the messaging system gateway using the universal messaging system interfaces . In some embodiments the machine running the messaging system interface may be a closed network machine that is designed to communicate with a proprietary network in order to transmit and receive communications to other machines that operate using the same proprietary protocols. The messaging system interface allows the machine to communicate directly with the messaging system without going through the proprietary network. By communicating directly with the messaging system the machine can communicate with any machine registered with the messaging system regardless of the proprietary nature of the other machines. In some embodiments the messaging system interfaces or may be an operating system that allows the machine running the messaging system interface or to communicate with the messaging system .

The built in universal messaging system interfaces allow the machine running the universal messaging system interfaces to perform operations that native firmware of the machines does not allow them to perform. For example the messaging system interface may override the native firmware of its machine to allow the machine to perform various operations that are outside of the functionality of the native firmware. In some embodiments the messaging system interface may be installed on a machine that does not have the ability to communicate with other machines using one or more connection protocols. In such embodiments the messaging system interface may provide the machine with the capability to use one or more connection protocols. The messaging system interfaces may access one or more sensors inputs outputs or programs on the machines running them in order to perform various operations. For example the messaging system interface may have access to and control a geolocation sensor a compass a camera a motion sensor a temperature sensor an accelerometer a gyroscope a graphical interface input a keypad input a touchscreen input a microphone a siren a display a light a tactile output a third party messaging service that the machine is able to run or any other component of the machine that can be identified accessed and or controlled.

The messaging system interfaces may each be assigned a different UUID and token. The messaging system interfaces may connect to the messaging system using the assigned UUID and token and may await further instructions from the messaging system . In some embodiments the messaging system may act as a compute server that controls the messaging system messaging system interfaces . For example messaging system may activate and or deactivate pins of the machine running the messaging system interface request sensor data from the machine and or cause the messaging system interface to perform other functions related to the machine. In some embodiments one or more of the messaging system interfaces can be connected to a gateway e.g. messaging system gateway or a mobile gateway and the gateway may act as a compute server that controls the messaging system interfaces in a similar manner as the messaging system . In some embodiments the messaging system interfaces may each be a mobile operating system or application that is able to run on mobile device operating systems such as iOS and Android operating systems.

In one example of using one or more messaging system interfaces a computing device may be provided. The computing device may include a Raspberry Pi board an Arduino board a microcontroller a minicomputer or any other suitable computing device. The computing device may be built into or integrated with a first device to allow the first device to communicate with other devices. For example the computing device includes a messaging system interface or universal interface for enabling one or more sensors of the first device to communicate with one or more sensors of a second device by connecting the one or more sensors with a network server of the messaging system . The first device and the second device may be in different locations such as different rooms of a building cities countries or continents. The first device may include a solar panel located on a roof of a building and the second device may include a dimmable light bulb located in a room of the building.

The proprietary protocol and native firmware of the first device and the proprietary protocol and native firmware of the second device may not allow the devices to exchange communications with each other or with the messaging system . The universal interface allows the first device to communicate with the messaging system in order to exchange communications with the second device. The universal interface is configured to and may obtain sensor data from a sensor of the first device. For example the universal interface may obtain sensor data from the solar panel indicating that it is getting dark outside of the building. The amount of sunlight being received may fall below a certain threshold level as measured by an amount of current being generated by the solar panel using the received sunlight. The universal interface may cause a transmitter of the first device to transmit the sensor data to a network server of the messaging system which may include a cloud network. The universal interface thus allows the first device to transmit sensor data to the messaging system even when the proprietary protocol or firmware of the first device does not allow the one or more sensors of the first device to communicate with other devices. In some embodiments the universal interface may transmit the sensor data to a messaging system gateway on a LAN and or a PAN with which the universal interface can communicate.

The universal interface may further receive a command from the messaging system . The command may be received when a sensor of the second device senses a condition. For example the light may include a photodiode that can sense light. The photodiode may sense natural light and in response may transmit a message to the messaging system e.g. using a universal interface installed on the dimmable light to query whether the solar panel senses sunlight. In this example the solar panel may have incorrectly determined that it was getting dark in response to the sun going behind a cloud. The command received by the universal interface may cause the sensor of the first device to perform a function. For example the solar panel may check the amount of current being produced based on the current amount of sunlight being received. The first device may then send a command to the messaging system with updated sensor data.

In some embodiments the universal interface is configured to and may determine a first universally unique identifier assigned to the sensor of the first device determine a second universally unique identifier assigned to a sensor of the second device and cause the transmitter to transmit the first universally unique identifier and the second universally unique identifier with the sensor data to the network server. Accordingly the network server of the messaging system may determine to which device and sensor to transmit the message and may determine the security access permissions of the first device sensor.

In another example a universal messaging system interface installed on a device may allow multiple sensors within the device to interact in a way that the sensors were not designed to operate. For example a device may include a thermostat. The thermostat may include a motion sensor that is designed to turn on a LED display when motion is detected. The thermostat may also include a controller that controls the temperature of an air conditioning system. The native proprietary protocol and firmware of the thermostat is not designed to allow the motion detector to be used except to send signals to turn on the LED display as motion is detected. For example the native proprietary protocol and firmware of the thermostat may not allow the motion sensor and the controller to communicate with one another. The thermostat may be integrated with a computing device e.g. a Raspberry Pi board an Arduino board a microcontroller a minicomputer or any other suitable computing device that has a universal messaging system interface installed on it. The universal messaging system interface allows the sensors of the thermostat to communicate with the messaging system . For example the motion sensor and the controller may be assigned separate UUIDs and tokens. The universal messaging system interface may stream motion data from the motion sensor to the messaging system . The messaging system may perform one or more functions based on the motion data. For example the messaging system may include a program that sends a message to the controller anytime motion is detected by the motion sensor. The program may be created by a user of the thermostat using the designer graphical interface implemented by the platform network or the design interface described above. The program may be stored in the messaging system and may access the motion data and convert motion sensor values to a command that is included in the message. The command may instruct the controller to turn the temperature of the air conditioning system to 72 degrees. Accordingly sensors of the thermostat that are not designed to communicate with one another can exchange messages using the messaging system and the messaging system interface.

The messaging system interface allows the motion sensor to stream motion data to the messaging system either directly or via the messaging system gateway . In some embodiments a user of the lighting system and motion sensor may create a program in the messaging system e.g. using the designer graphical interface implemented by the platform network or the design interface described above that accesses the streamed motion data and converts motion sensor values to different colors and or patterns of the lighting system . For example when motion is detected the colors of the lights in the lighting system should all be different colors e.g. red blue and green . Otherwise the lights in the lighting system should all be the same color e.g. white . The program may be mapped to the UUID of the motion sensor and the UUID of the lighting system . As the motion data is streamed the messaging system gateway e.g. using a plug in as described above and or the messaging system may convert the connection protocol and or the application programming interface protocol of the motion sensor to the native protocols used by the messaging system if needed. The messaging system may implement the user s program based on the received motion data and may output a message to the messaging system gateway in accordance with the motion data. For example when data is received indicating that motion is detected the messaging system may send a message to the messaging system gateway with commands that cause the lights of the lighting system to be turned red blue and green. The messaging system gateway may include a plug in that converts the generic message from the messaging system to a proprietary message that a proprietary application programming interface of the lighting system can interpret e.g. a Philips Hue proprietary protocol or the like . The messaging system gateway may then output messages in the appropriate proprietary format to each of the lights of the lighting system with the hue values according to red blue and green.

The messaging systems or may also allow serially connected devices that are located remote from one another to communicate. The serially connected devices may not be configured to communicate directly with a messaging system and thus may be required to serially connect to another device that can connect with the messaging system. For example the serially connected devices may not be equipped with a wireless transceiver or with a wired port that allows the devices to communicate with a network. In some examples the messaging system may allow a first serial device and or serial interface to connect to the messaging system and communicate with it from anywhere in the world via the universal application programming interface or any of the native protocols of the messaging system. A second serial device may also be connected to the messaging system via a device that can directly connect to the messaging system . The messaging system may bind sessions of the first and second serially connected devices together in effect creating a virtual serial cable connection that extends to the two remote locations of the first and second serially connected devices. Each of the serially connected devices may be assigned a UUID and token by the messaging system similar to that described above. The messaging system may convert the serial input communication from the first serially connected device to a communication in the native protocol of the messaging system and may process the input using the universal application programming interface. The messaging system may then convert the communication back to serial on the output before sending the communication to the second serially connected device. Accordingly a first serially connected device can communicate with another serially connected device over the cloud network of the messaging system by sending serial communications to the messaging system .

In some embodiments the virtual serial cable created by the messaging system can connect serial devices or emulated serial devices in various configurations such as one to one one to many and many to many. In the example provided above one serially connected device may be connected to another serially connected device. In another example one serially connected device may be connected to more than one other serially connected device. In yet another example multiple serially connected devices may be connected to multiple other serially connected devices. A many to many serial device set of connections may operate as a wide area network of serially connected devices.

In one example a network server for binding remote serially connected devices may be provided. The network server may be part of the messaging system or . The network server includes one or more data processors and a receiver. The receiver is configured to and may receive a serial communication from a first serially connected device located in a first location. The first serially connected device is assigned a first universally unique identifier and the serial communication includes a second universally unique identifier assigned to a second serially connected device located in a second location. In some embodiments the first serially connected device and the second serially connected device are not configured to communicate with the network server. The first serially connected device is serially connected to a first device that enables communication with the network server and the second serially connected device is serially connected to a second device that enables communication with the network server.

The network server further includes a non transitory computer readable storage medium containing instructions which when executed on the one or more data processors cause the one or more processors to perform operations. The network server may obtain the second universally unique identifier and determine that the second universally unique identifier is assigned to the second serially connected device. The network server may create a virtual serial connection between the first serially connected device and the second serially connected device. The virtual serial connection is established with the second serially connected device based on the second universally unique identifier being assigned to the second serially connected device. The network server further includes a transmitter that is configured to and may transmit the serial communication to the second serially connected device located in the second location. In some embodiments the transmitter may also transmit the first universally unique identifier along with the serial communication to the second serially connected device. Once received by the second serially connected device the serial communication causes the second serially connected device to perform an operation.

In some embodiments creating the virtual serial connection includes binding communications of the first and second serially connected devices to the other of the first and second serially connected devices such that all communications communicated from the first serially connected device are transmitted to the second serially connected device and such that all communications communicated from the second serially connected device are transmitted to the first serially connected device until the virtual serial connection is released. For example the connection may be released once one or both of the first or second serially connected devices are taken offline and the connection with the messaging system is released.

The serial device may detect motion and may transmit a serial communication including motion data over the serial connection to the device . The device may relay the serial communication to the messaging system . The messaging system may convert the serial communication from the serial device to a communication in the native protocol of the messaging system. The messaging system may process the input using the universal application programming interface in order to determine what output to send to the serial device . For example the messaging system may store a program e.g. created by a user using the designer graphical interface implemented by the platform network or the design interface described above that generates an output communication that causes the serial device to play music whenever motion data is received. The messaging system may then convert the output communication back to serial before sending the output communication to the serial device via the device .

The communication sessions of the serial devices and may be bound to one another until the virtual serial connection is released. For example the connection may be released once one or both of the serial devices and are taken offline and the connection with the messaging system is released.

Process is illustrated as a logical flow diagram the operation of which represent a sequence of operations that can be implemented in hardware computer instructions or a combination thereof. In the context of computer instructions the operations represent computer executable instructions stored on one or more computer readable storage media that when executed by one or more processors perform the recited operations. Generally computer executable instructions include routines programs objects components data structures and the like that perform particular functions or implement particular data types. The order in which the operations are described is not intended to be construed as a limitation and any number of the described operations can be combined in any order and or in parallel to implement the processes.

Additionally the process may be performed under the control of one or more computer systems configured with executable instructions and may be implemented as code e.g. executable instructions one or more computer programs or one or more applications executing collectively on one or more processors by hardware or combinations thereof. As noted above the code may be stored on a machine readable storage medium for example in the form of a computer program comprising a plurality of instructions executable by one or more processors. The machine readable storage medium may be non transitory.

At the process includes receiving by a computing device a communication from a first IoT device wherein the first IoT device is communicatively connected to the computing device using a first connection protocol and wherein the communication is received using the first connection protocol. In some embodiments the computing device may be a network server of a messaging system e.g. messaging system or . For example the first IoT device may transmit a communication destined for a second IoT device. The communication may be received by the computing device directly from the first IoT device over a wide area network or may be received via a messaging system gateway e.g. messaging system gateway or or a mobile gateway e.g. mobile gateway via a local area network and or a personal area network. In some embodiments the first IoT device may include a messaging system interface e.g. messaging system interface or . The first connection protocol may be a connection protocol that is native to the computing device.

At the process includes determining a second IoT device to which the communication is intended to be transmitted. At the process includes determining a second connection protocol used by the second IoT device.

Process is illustrated as a logical flow diagram the operation of which represent a sequence of operations that can be implemented in hardware computer instructions or a combination thereof. In the context of computer instructions the operations represent computer executable instructions stored on one or more computer readable storage media that when executed by one or more processors perform the recited operations. Generally computer executable instructions include routines programs objects components data structures and the like that perform particular functions or implement particular data types. The order in which the operations are described is not intended to be construed as a limitation and any number of the described operations can be combined in any order and or in parallel to implement the processes.

Additionally the process may be performed under the control of one or more computer systems configured with executable instructions and may be implemented as code e.g. executable instructions one or more computer programs or one or more applications executing collectively on one or more processors by hardware or combinations thereof. As noted above the code may be stored on a machine readable storage medium for example in the form of a computer program comprising a plurality of instructions executable by one or more processors. The machine readable storage medium may be non transitory.

At the process includes obtaining by a computing device sensor data from a sensor of a first device. The computing device may include a Raspberry Pi board an Arduino board a microcontroller a minicomputer or any other suitable computing device. The computing device may be built into or integrated with a first device to allow the first device to communicate with other devices. For example the computing device includes a messaging system interface or universal interface for enabling one or more sensors of the first device to communicate with one or more sensors of a second device by connecting the one or more sensors with a network server of a messaging system e.g. messaging system or . The first device and the second device may be in different locations such as different rooms of a building different cities different countries or different continents. In one example the first device may include a solar panel located on a roof of a building and the second device may include a dimmable light bulb located in a room of the building.

At the process includes causing a transmitter to transmit the sensor data to a network server of the messaging system wherein a proprietary protocol of the first device does not allow the one or more sensors of the first device to communicate with other devices. For example the proprietary protocol and native firmware of the first device and the proprietary protocol and native firmware of a second device may not allow the devices to exchange communications with each other or with the messaging system. The universal interface allows the first device to communicate with the messaging system in order to exchange communications with the second device. The universal interface is configured to and may obtain sensor data from a sensor of the first device. Using the example above the universal interface may obtain sensor data from the solar panel indicating that it is getting dark outside of the building. The amount of sunlight being received may fall below a certain threshold level as measured by an amount of current being generated by the solar panel using the received sunlight. The universal interface may instruct the transmitter to transmit the sensor data to the messaging system. Accordingly the universal interface thus allows the first device to transmit sensor data to the messaging system even when the proprietary protocol or firmware of the first device does not allow the one or more sensors of the first device to communicate with other devices. In some embodiments the sensor data is transmitted to a cloud network that includes the network server. In some embodiments the sensor data is transmitted to a messaging system gateway connected to a same local area network as the computing device. In some embodiments the sensor data is transmitted to a mobile gateway via a personal area network.

At the process includes receiving a command from the messaging system wherein the command is received when a sensor of the second device senses a condition and wherein the command causes the sensor of the first device to perform a function. For example the dimmable light bulb may include a photodiode that can sense light. The photodiode may sense natural light and in response may transmit a message to the messaging system e.g. using a universal interface installed on the dimmable light to query whether the solar panel senses sunlight. Clouds covering the sun may have caused the amount of sunlight to fall below the threshold causing the solar panel to send the sensor data indicating darkness. In response to receiving the message transmitted by the light bulb the solar panel may check the amount of current being produced based on the amount of sunlight being received. The first device may then send a command to the messaging system with updated sensor data based on the current measurement.

In some embodiments the process includes determining a first universally unique identifier assigned to the sensor of the first device determining a second universally unique identifier assigned to a sensor of the second device and causing the transmitter to transmit the first universally unique identifier and the second universally unique identifier with the sensor data to the network server. Accordingly the network server of the messaging system may determine to which device and sensor to transmit the message and may determine the security access permissions of the first device sensor.

At the process includes transmitting the serial communication to the second serially connected device located in the second location wherein the serial communication causes the second serially connected device to perform an operation. In some embodiments the first universally unique identifier may be transmitted along with the serial communication to the second serially connected device.

In some embodiments the process further includes converting the received serial communication to a communication in a native protocol of the network server and processing the communication using an application programming interface. In some embodiments the process further includes converting the communication back to a serial format before transmitting the communication to the second serially connected device.

In some embodiments creating the virtual serial connection includes binding communications of the first and second serially connected devices to the other of the first and second serially connected devices such that all communications communicated from the first serially connected device are transmitted to the second serially connected device and such that all communications communicated from the second serially connected device are transmitted to the first serially connected device until the virtual serial connection is released. For example the connection may be released once one or both of the first or second serially connected devices are taken offline and the connection with the messaging system is released.
