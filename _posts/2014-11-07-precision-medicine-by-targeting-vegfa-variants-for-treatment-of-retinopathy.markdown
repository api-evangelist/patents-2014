It is recognized that individual humans differ in their sequence and recently several individuals have had their genomes sequenced for instance James Watson and Craig Venter. Comparison of the genome sequence of individuals has revealed differences in their sequences in both coding and non coding parts of the genome. Some of these variations in humans are significant and contribute to phenotypic differences between individuals. In extreme cases these will result in genetic disease. The 1000 Genomes Project has the objective of cataloguing sequences in the human genome involving sequencing the genomes of a very large sampling of individuals from diverse art recognized human ethnic populations.

Through the application of human genetic variation analysis and rationally designed sequence selection the present invention provides for improved human patient diagnosis and therapy. Importantly the invention enables tailored medicines that address individual human patient genotypes or phenotypes.

The inventor s analysis of large numbers of naturally occurring genomic human TOI sequences reveals that there is significant variation across diverse human populations and provides for the ability for correlation between individual human patients and tailored medical and diagnostic approaches addressing the target. The technical applications of these findings as per the present invention thus contribute to better treatment prophylaxis and diagnosis in humans and provides for patient benefit by enabling personalized medicines and therapies. This provides advantages of better prescribing less wastage of medications and improved chances of drug efficacy and better diagnosis in patients.

Furthermore the inventor surprisingly realised that some rarer natural forms although present in humans at much lower frequencies than the common form nevertheless are represented in multiple and ethnically diverse human populations and usually with many human examples per represented ethnic population. Thus the inventor realised that targeting such rarer forms would provide for effective treatment prophylaxis or diagnosis across many human ethnic populations thereby extending the utility of the present invention and better serving patients in those populations.

With this the inventor realised that there is significant industrial and medical application for the invention in terms of guiding the choice of an anti TOI ligand for administration to human patients for therapy and or prophylaxis of TOI mediated or associated diseases and conditions. In this way the patient receives drugs and ligands that are tailored to their needs as determined by the patient s genetic or phenotypic makeup. Hand in hand with this the invention provides for the genotyping and or phenotyping of patients in connection with such treatment thereby allowing a proper match of drug to patient. This increases the chances of medical efficacy reduces the likelihood of inferior treatment using drugs or ligands that are not matched to the patient eg poor efficacy and or side effects and avoids pharmaceutical mis prescription and waste.

The invention provides useful anti target ligands for addressing humans suffering from or likely to suffer from a disease or condition mediated or associated with the TOI. For example the ligand specifically binds to the TOI variant as per the invention. The ligand may inhibit or antagonise the activity of the target eg the ligand neutralises the target. The skilled person will be familiar with neutralising ligands in general such as antibodies or antibody fragments and can readily test suitable ligands for specific binding and or neutralisation of a target in vitro or in an in vivo assay.

An antibody fragment comprises a portion of an intact antibody preferably the antigen binding and or the variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include dAb Fab Fab F ab 2 and Fv fragments diabodies linear antibodies single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.

In an embodiment the ligand of the invention is or comprises an antibody or antibody fragment for example an antibody or fragment comprising human variable regions and optionally also human constant regions . Anti TOI or TOI binding or targeting antibodies and fragments can be prepared according to any known method eg using transgenic mice eg the Kymouse or Velocimouse or Omnimouse Xenomouse HuMab Mouse or MeMo Mouse rats eg the Omnirat camelids sharks rabbits chickens or other non human animals immunised with the TOI followed optionally by humanisation of the constant regions and or variable regions to produce human or humanised antibodies. In an example display technologies can be used such as yeast phage or ribosome display as will be apparent to the skilled person. Standard affinity maturation eg using a display technology can be performed in a further step after isolation of an antibody lead from a transgenic animal phage display library or other library. Representative examples of suitable technologies are described in US20120093818 Amgen Inc which is incorporated herein by reference eg the methods set out in paragraphs 0309 to 0346 .

Generally a VELOCIMMUNE or other mouse or rat can be challenged with the antigen of interest and lymphatic cells such as B cells are recovered from the mice that express antibodies. The lymphatic cells may be fused with a myeloma cell line to prepare immortal hybridoma cell lines and such hybridoma cell lines are screened and selected to identify hybridoma cell lines that produce antibodies specific to the antigen of interest. DNA encoding the variable regions of the heavy chain and light chain may be isolated and linked to desirable isotypic constant regions of the heavy chain and light chain. Such an antibody protein may be produced in a cell such as a CHO cell. Alternatively DNA encoding the antigen specific chimaeric antibodies or the variable domains of the light and heavy chains may be isolated directly from antigen specific lymphocytes.

Initially high affinity chimaeric antibodies are isolated having a human variable region and a mouse constant region. As described below the antibodies are characterized and selected for desirable characteristics including affinity selectivity epitope etc. The mouse constant regions are replaced with a desired human constant region to generate the fully human antibody of the invention for example wild type or modified IgG1 or IgG4 for example SEQ ID NO 751 752 753 in US2011 0065902 which sequences are incorporated herein by reference for use in the ligands of the present invention .

For example the TOI is human PCSK9 eg a mature cleaved autocatalysed or active PCSK9. In an example the disease is a cardiovascular disease such as hyperlipidaemia.

Ligands of the invention are useful for instance in specific binding assays for genotyping or phenotyping humans affinity purification of the TOI and in screening assays to identify other antagonists of TOI activity. Some of the ligands of the invention are useful for inhibiting binding of TOI to a congnate human receptor or protein or inhibiting TOI mediated activities.

The invention encompasses anti TOI eg PCSK9 antibody ligands having a modified glycosylation pattern. In some applications modification to remove undesirable glycosylation sites may be useful or e.g. removal of a fucose moiety to increase antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC function see Shield et al. 2002 JBC 277 26733 . In other applications modification of galactosylation can be made in order to modify complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC .

In an example the invention features a pharmaceutical composition comprising a ligand of the invention wherein the ligand is or comprises a recombinant human antibody or fragment thereof which specifically binds the TOI eg a rare variant as described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In one embodiment the invention features a composition which is a combination of an antibody ligand or antigen binding fragment of an antibody of the invention and a second therapeutic agent. The second therapeutic agent may be any of an anti inflammatory agent an anti angiogenesis agent a painkiller a diuretic a chemotherapeutic agent an anti neoplastic agent a vasodilator a vasoconstrictor a statin a beta blocker a nutrient an adjuvant an anti obesity agent and an anti diabetes agent.

 Pharmaceutically acceptable refers to approved or approvable by a regulatory agency of the USA Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals including humans. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier excipient or adjuvant refers to an carrier excipient or adjuvant that can be administered to a subject together with an agent e.g. any antibody or antibody chain described herein and which does not destroy the pharmacological activity thereof and is nontoxic when administered in doses sufficient to deliver a therapeutic amount of the agent.

In an example the invention features a method for inhibiting TOI activity using the anti TOI ligand of the invention eg an antibody or antigen binding portion of the antibody of the invention wherein the therapeutic method comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the ligand. The disorder treated is any disease or condition which is improved ameliorated inhibited or prevented by removal inhibition or reduction of TOI activity.

By the phrase therapeutically effective amount is meant an amount that produces the desired effect for which it is administered. The exact amount will depend on the purpose of the treatment and will be ascertainable by one skilled in the art using known techniques see for example Lloyd 1999 The Art Science and Technology of Pharmaceutical Compounding .

The term specifically binds or the like means that a ligand eg an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof forms a complex with an antigen that is relatively stable under physiologic conditions. Specific binding can be characterized by an equilibrium dissociation constant of at least about 1 10M or less e.g. a smaller KD denotes a tighter binding . Methods for determining whether two molecules specifically bind are well known in the art and include for example equilibrium dialysis surface plasmon resonance and the like. An isolated antibody that specifically binds a human TOI may however exhibit cross reactivity to other antigens such as a TOI molecule from another species. Moreover multi specific antibodies e.g. bispecifics that bind to human TOI and one or more additional antigens are nonetheless considered antibodies that specifically bind TOI as used herein.

The skilled person will be familiar with techniques that can be used for accurate genotyping and application to the invention. These include the following.

Miniaturized assays such as microarrays with oligonucleotide reagents immobilized on small surfaces are frequently proposed for large scale mutation analysis and high throughput genotyping Large scale identification mapping and genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the human genome Wang D G Fan J B Siao C J Berno A Young P Sapolsky R Ghandour G Perkins N Winchester E Spencer J Kruglyak L Stein L Hsie L Topaloglou T Hubbell E Robinson E Mittmann M Morris M S Shen N Kilburn D Rioux J Nusbaum C Rozen S Hudson T J Lipshutz R Chee M Lander E S Science. 1998 May 15 280 5366 1077 82 .

An approach for a fully automated large scale SNP analysis is the homogeneous assay i.e. a single phase assay without separation steps permitting continual monitoring during amplification. The TaqMan assay Applied Biosystems originally designed for quantitative real time PCR is a homogeneous single step assay also used in determination of mutation status of DNA see eg A. A. Komar ed. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms Methods in Molecular Biology 578 DOI 10.1007 978 1 60327 411 119 Humana Press a part of Springer Science Business Media LLC and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms Methods in Molecular Biology Volume 578 2009 pp 293 306 The TaqMan Method for SNP Genotyping Gong Qing Shen et al . The TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay exploits the 5 exonuclease activity of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase to cleave a doubly labeled probe hybridized to the SNP containing sequence of ssDNA. Cleavage separates a 5 fluorophore from a 3 quencher leading to detectable fluorescent signal. The use of two allele specific probes carrying different fluorophores permits SNP determination in the same tube without any post PCR processing. Genotype is determined from the ratio of intensities of the two fluorescent probes at the end of amplification. Thus rather than taking advantage of the full set of real time PCR data as in quantitative studies only end point data are used.

TaqMan SNP genotyping in a high throughput automated manner is facilitated by the use of validated Pre made TaqMan Genotyping assays but Custom TaqMan Assays may also be used High throughput genotyping with single nucleotide polymorphisms Ranade K Chang M S Ting C T Pei D Hsiao C F Olivier M Pesich R Hebert J Chen Y D Dzau V J Curb D Olshen R Risch N Cox D R Botstein D Genome Res. 2001 July 11 7 1262 8 Assessment of two flexible and compatible SNP genotyping platforms TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays and the SNPlex Genotyping System De la Vega F M Lazaruk K D Rhodes M D Wenz M H Mutat Res. 2005 Jun. 3 573 1 2 111 35 . The results of the assay can be automatically determined by genotyping software provided with real time thermal cyclers e.g. IQ software of Bio Rad Sequence Detection Software of Applied Biosystems .

Single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs can be determined using TaqMan real time PCR assays Applied Biosystems and commercial software that assigns genotypes based on reporter probe signals at the end of amplification. An algorithm for automatic genotype caling of SNPs using the full course of TaqMan real time data is available for use A. Callegaro et al Nucleic Acids Res. 2006 34 7 e56 Published online 2006 Apr. 14. doi 10.1093 nar gk1185 PMCID PMC1440877 . The algorithm is unique in that it classifies samples according to the behavior of blanks no DNA samples which cluster with heterozygous samples. This method of classification eliminates the need for positive controls and permits accurate genotyping even in the absence of a genotype class for example when one allele is rare.

The skilled person will be familiar with techniques that can be used for accurate phenotyping and application to the invention. These include the use of amino acid sequencing of isolated target protein and comparison of sequences from different variants eg with the most common variant . An antibody that specifically and selectively binds in the area of a SNP under stringent conditions can also be used to identify a particular variant. In another method the genotype is determined and a corresponding amino acid sequence phenotype determined eg by in silico translation.

The invention provides therapeutic compositions comprising the anti TOI ligand eg antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof of the present invention. The administration of therapeutic compositions in accordance with the invention will be administered with suitable carriers excipients and other agents that are incorporated into formulations to provide improved transfer delivery tolerance and the like. A multitude of appropriate formulations can be found in the formulary known to all pharmaceutical chemists Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences Mack Publishing Company Easton Pa. These formulations include for example powders pastes ointments jellies waxes oils lipids lipid cationic or anionic containing vesicles such as LIPOFECTINT DNA conjugates anhydrous absorption pastes oil in water and water in oil emulsions emulsions carbowax polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights semi solid gels and semi solid mixtures containing carbowax. See also Powell et al. Compendium of excipients for parenteral formulations PDA 1998 J Pharm Sci Technol 52 238 311.

The dose may vary depending upon the age and the size of a subject to be administered target disease conditions route of administration and the like. When the ligand eg antibody of the present invention is used for treating various conditions and diseases associated with the TOI in an adult patient it is advantageous to intravenously administer the antibody of the present invention normally at a single dose of about 0.01 to about 20 mg kg body weight more preferably about 0.02 to about 7 about 0.03 to about 5 or about 0.05 to about 3 mg kg body weight. Depending on the severity of the condition the frequency and the duration of the treatment can be adjusted.

Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer the ligand or pharmaceutical composition of the invention for example a ligand provided by e.g. encapsulation in liposomes microparticles microcapsules recombinant cells capable of expressing the mutant viruses receptor mediated endocytosis see e.g. Wu et al. 1987 J. Biol. Chem. 262 4429 4432 . Methods of introduction include but are not limited to intradermal intramuscular intraperitoneal intravenous subcutaneous intranasal epidural and oral routes. The ligand or composition may be administered by any convenient route for example by infusion or bolus injection by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings e.g. oral mucosa rectal and intestinal mucosa etc. and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local.

The ligand or pharmaceutical composition can be also delivered in a vesicle in particular a liposome see Langer 1990 Science 249 1527 1533 Treat et al. 1989 in Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer Lopez Berestein and Fidler eds.

In certain situations the ligand or pharmaceutical composition can be delivered in a controlled release system. In one embodiment a pump may be used see Langer supra Sefton 1987 CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14 201 . In another embodiment polymeric materials can be used see Medical Applications of Controlled Release Langer and Wise eds. CRC Pres. Boca Raton Fla. 1974 . In yet another embodiment a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the composition s target thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose see e.g. Goodson in Medical Applications of Controlled Release supra vol. 2 pp. 115 138 1984 .

The injectable preparations may include dosage forms for intravenous subcutaneous intracutaneous and intramuscular injections drip infusions etc. These injectable preparations may be prepared by methods publicly known. For example the injectable preparations may be prepared e.g. by dissolving suspending or emulsifying the antibody or its salt described above in a sterile aqueous medium or an oily medium conventionally used for injections. As the aqueous medium for injections there are for example physiological saline an isotonic solution containing glucose and other auxiliary agents etc. which may be used in combination with an appropriate solubilizing agent such as an alcohol e.g. ethanol a polyalcohol e.g. propylene glycol polyethylene glycol a nonionic surfactant e.g. polysorbate 80 HCO 50 polyoxyethylene 50 mol adduct of hydrogenated castor oil etc. As the oily medium there are employed e.g. sesame oil soybean oil etc. which may be used in combination with a solubilizing agent such as benzyl benzoate benzyl alcohol etc. The injection thus prepared is preferably filled in an appropriate ampoule. A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be delivered subcutaneously or intravenously with a standard needle and syringe. In addition with respect to subcutaneous delivery a pen delivery device readily has applications in delivering a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Such a pen delivery device can be reusable or disposable. A reusable pen delivery device generally utilizes a replaceable cartridge that contains a pharmaceutical composition. Once all of the pharmaceutical composition within the cartridge has been administered and the cartridge is empty the empty cartridge can readily be discarded and replaced with a new cartridge that contains the pharmaceutical composition. The pen delivery device can then be reused. In a disposable pen delivery device there is no replaceable cartridge. Rather the disposable pen delivery device comes prefilled with the pharmaceutical composition held in a reservoir within the device. Once the reservoir is emptied of the pharmaceutical composition the entire device is discarded.

Nucleotide and polypeptide sequences for a number of PCSK9 isoforms are provided herein e.g. SEQ ID NOs 1 37.

PCSK9 exists as both a pro form and a mature form. Autocatalysis of the PCSK9 proform occurs between Gln152 and Ser153 VFAQ SIP SEQ ID NO 116 Naureckiene et al. 2003 and has been shown to be required for its secretion from cells Seidah et al. 2003 .

As used herein ligand refers to a molecule which can bind e.g. specifically bind to a second molecule or receptor. In some embodiments a ligand can be e.g. an antibody antibody fragment antibody portion and or affibody.

The term variant as used herein refers to a peptide or nucleic acid that differs from the polypeptide or nucleic acid eg the most common one in humans eg most frequent in a database as disclosed herein such as the 1000 Genomes Project database by one or more amino acid or nucleic acid deletions additions yet retains one or more specific functions or biological activities of the naturally occurring molecule Amino acid substitutions include alterations in which an amino acid is replaced with a different naturally occurring amino acid residue. Such substitutions may be classified as conservative in which case an amino acid residue contained in a polypeptide is replaced with another naturally occurring amino acid of similar character either in relation to polarity side chain functionality or size. Such conservative substitutions are well known in the art. Substitutions encompassed by the present invention may also be non conservative in which an amino acid residue which is present in a peptide is substituted with an amino acid having different properties such as naturally occurring amino acid from a different group e.g. substituting a charged or hydrophobic amino acid with alanine or alternatively in which a naturally occurring amino acid is substituted with a non conventional amino acid. In some embodiments amino acid substitutions are conservative. Also encompassed within the term variant when used with reference to a polynucleotide or polypeptide refers to a polynucleotide or polypeptide that can vary in primary secondary or tertiary structure as compared to a reference polynucleotide or polypeptide respectively e.g. as compared to a wild type polynucleotide or polypeptide .

Variants of PCSK9 are provided elsewhere herein. Variants of PCSK9 can include the forms described herein as a f c r p m e h aj and q. Sequences of these variants are provided herein see e.g SEQ ID NOs 1 27 and in Table 1 2 or 6.

In some aspects one can use synthetic variants recombinant variants or chemically modified polynucleotide variants or polypeptide variants isolated or generated using methods well known in the art. Modified variants can include conservative or non conservative amino acid changes as described below. Polynucleotide changes can result in amino acid substitutions additions deletions fusions and truncations in the polypeptide encoded by the reference sequence. Some aspects use include insertion variants deletion variants or substituted variants with substitutions of amino acids including insertions and substitutions of amino acids and other molecules that do not normally occur in the peptide sequence that is the basis of the variant for example but not limited to insertion of ornithine which do not normally occur in human proteins. The term conservative substitution when describing a polypeptide refers to a change in the amino acid composition of the polypeptide that does not substantially alter the polypeptide s activity. For example a conservative substitution refers to substituting an amino acid residue for a different amino acid residue that has similar chemical properties. Conservative amino acid substitutions include replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine an aspartate with a glutamate or a threonine with a serine.

 Conservative amino acid substitutions result from replacing one amino acid with another having similar structural and or chemical properties such as the replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine an aspartate with a glutamate or a threonine with a serine. Thus a conservative substitution of a particular amino acid sequence refers to substitution of those amino acids that are not critical for polypeptide activity or substitution of amino acids with other amino acids having similar properties e.g. acidic basic positively or negatively charged polar or non polar etc. such that the substitution of even critical amino acids does not reduce the activity of the peptide i.e. the ability of the peptide to penetrate the blood brain barrier BBB . Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. For example the following six groups each contain amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another 1 Alanine A Serine S Threonine T 2 Aspartic acid D Glutamic acid E 3 Asparagine N Glutamine Q 4 Arginine R Lysine K 5 Isoleucine I Leucine L Methionine M Valine V and 6 Phenylalanine F Tyrosine Y Tryptophan W . See also Creighton Proteins W. H. Freeman and Company 1984 incorporated by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments individual substitutions deletions or additions that alter add or delete a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids can also be considered conservative substitutions if the change does not reduce the activity of the peptide. Insertions or deletions are typically in the range of about 1 to 5 amino acids. The choice of conservative amino acids may be selected based on the location of the amino acid to be substituted in the peptide for example if the amino acid is on the exterior of the peptide and expose to solvents or on the interior and not exposed to solvents.

In alternative embodiments one can select the amino acid which will substitute an existing amino acid based on the location of the existing amino acid i.e. its exposure to solvents i.e. if the amino acid is exposed to solvents or is present on the outer surface of the peptide or polypeptide as compared to internally localized amino acids not exposed to solvents . Selection of such conservative amino acid substitutions are well known in the art for example as disclosed in Dordo et al J. MoI Biol 1999 217 721 739 and Taylor et al J. Theor. Biol. 119 1986 205 218 and S. French and B. Robson J. MoI. Evol. 19 1983 171. Accordingly one can select conservative amino acid substitutions suitable for amino acids on the exterior of a protein or peptide i e amino acids exposed to a solvent for example but not limited to the following substitutions can be used substitution of Y with F T with S or K P with A E with D or Q N with D or G R with K G with N or A T with S or K D with N or E I with L or V F with Y S with T or A R with K G with N or A K with R A with S K or P.

In alternative embodiments one can also select conservative amino acid substitutions encompassed suitable for amino acids on the interior of a protein or peptide for example one can use suitable conservative substitutions for amino acids is on the interior of a protein or peptide i.e. the amino acids are not exposed to a solvent for example but not limited to one can use the following conservative substitutions where Y is substituted with F T with A or S I with L or V W with Y M with L N with D G with A T with A or S D with N I with L or V F with Y or L S with A or T and A with S G T or V.

Treatment is generally effective if one or more symptoms or clinical markers are reduced. Alternatively treatment is effective if the progression of a disease is reduced or halted. That is treatment includes not just the improvement of symptoms or markers but also a cessation of or at least slowing of progress or worsening of symptoms compared to what would be expected in the absence of treatment. Beneficial or desired clinical results include but are not limited to alleviation of one or more symptom s diminishment of extent of disease stabilized i.e. not worsening state of disease delay or slowing of disease progression amelioration or palliation of the disease state remission whether partial or total and or decreased mortality whether detectable or undetectable. The term treatment of a disease also includes providing relief from the symptoms or side effects of the disease including palliative treatment . For treatment to be effective a complete cure is not contemplated. The method can in certain aspects include cure as well.

As used herein the term pharmaceutical composition refers to the active agent in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier e.g. a carrier commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry. The phrase pharmaceutically acceptable is employed herein to refer to those compounds materials compositions and or dosage forms which are within the scope of sound medical judgment suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity irritation allergic response or other problem or complication commensurate with a reasonable benefit risk ratio.

As used herein the term administering refers to the placement of a compound as disclosed herein into a subject by a method or route which results in at least partial delivery of the agent at a desired site.

The decrease can be due to administration of a pharmaceutical composition e.g. administration of a composition as described herein or another composition e.g. a statin or due to another cause e.g. a change in diet and or exercise.

An existing treatment for high cholesterol levels is the administration of a statin. As referred to herein a statin also known as HMG CoA reductase inhibitors are inhibitors of the enzyme HMG coA reductase which mediates cholesterol production in the liver. Statins by competitively binding HMG CoA reductase prevent the binding of HMG CoA to the enzyme and thereby inhibit the activity of the reductase e.g. the production of mevalonate . Non limiting examples of statins can include atorvastatin LIPITOR fluvastatin LESCOL lovastatin MEVACOR ALTOCOR pitavastatin LIVALO pravastatin PRAVACHOL rosuvastatin CRESTOR and simvastatin ZOCOR .

In an example frequencies herein are according to the 1000 Genomes database eg the Phase I database or as shown in Ensemble available on the world wide web at ensembl.org eg at 1October 2013 or 1October 2014. In an example each SNP encodes a non synonymous amino acid variation ie the SNP is not a silent mutation.

As described herein the present invention contemplates ligands eg antibodies and fragments whose binding site specificities have been matched to one or more variant human TOIs eg PCSK9 or IL6R . Additionally or alternatively and as further illustrated in the non limiting Examples below an optional aspect of the invention provides for matching of other features of the ligand to the patient s genotype or phenotype. In this respect for example the invention includes the ability to match amino acid sequence variation in a human patient to one or more ligand sequences or domains outside of the binding sites. For example where the ligand comprises or consists of a human TOI binding antibody or an anti human TOI receptor Fc fusion this aspect of the invention provides for more tailored matching of one or more constant region domains eg the Fc to the patient genotype or phenotype. Additionally or alternatively it is contemplated that sequence variation in the binding site can be similarly matched to the patient s genotype or phenotype. The present inventor has done this by considering the SNP occurrences in sequences encoding one or more parts of the ligand eg SNP occurrences in one more or all of the gene segments from which the variable domain s and or constant region domain s are derived. The inventor realised that it would be desirable to match the ligand to one or more corresponding variant SNPs found in the patient to be treated therapeutically and or prophylactically. Matching could involve designing the ligand specifically for a patient of known phenotype and or genotype or matching could involve choosing a ligand by determining that there is correspondence between variation in the patient s phenotype or genotype with the variation in the ligand amino acid and or corresponding nucleotides.

A key consideration for the inventor was the desire to promote compatibility of the ligand with the patient s body and in particular the possible patient immune system responses to administered ligands. For example it has been observed that human patients receiving human or humanised antibody drugs may mount an immune response against the incoming antibody a so called HAHA response which results in the patient producing anti drug antibodies as a result of the patient s immune system recognising the drug as foreign. For example studies have suggested that some patients receiving HUMIRA adalimumab currently the biggest selling antibody medicine mount a HAHA immune response against the medicine and this may impact treatment adversely. Reference is made to JAMA. 2011 305 14 1460 1468. doi 10.1001 jama.2011.406 Development of Antidrug Antibodies Against Adalimumab and Association With Disease Activity and Treatment Failure During Long term Follow up GM Bartelds et al. The authors concluded that results of this study showed that development of antidrug antibodies was associated with a negative outcome of adalimumab treatment in human RA patients. It was reported that not only did patients with anti adalimumab antibodies discontinue treatment more often and earlier than patients without anti adalimumab antibodies they also had a higher disease activity during treatment and only rarely came into remission. In addition reportedly the data showed that two thirds of the anti adalimumab antibody positive patients developed these antibodies in the first 28 weeks of treatment and that the presence of anti adalimumab antibodies substantially influenced serum adalimumab concentrations.

This HAHA theme is therefore a significant concern and this has been considered by the regulatory authorities. For example the European Medicines Agency EMA has issued a Guideline on immunogenicity assessment of monoclonal antibodies intended for in vivo clinical use available on the world wide web at ema.europa.eu docs en GB documentlibrary Scientific guideline 2012 06 WC500128688.pdf EMA CHMP BMWP 86289 2010 addendum to EMEA CHMP BMWP 14327 2006 which came into force on 1December 2012. As such it is good practice for researchers to identify and assess risk of anti antibody drug occurrence and effects.

The present aspect of the invention by more closely tailoring the ligand itself as well as its specificity to the patient helps to address these considerations when designing and administering anti human TOI medicines for treating and or preventing human TOI related diseases and conditions.

The inventor also considered the desirability to tailor the variation in the ligand constant region eg for an antibody or Fc containing ligand mindful that then the constant region being administered to the patient would be tuned to the various components such as patient s Fc receptors that would interact with the constant region in the patient. Good Fc Fc receptor interactions can be important for drug recycling via the FcRn to provide for useful half lives in vivo or for use in cell killing eg for cancer indications. In this way it is possible therefore to tune the effector function of the constant region eg Fc to the patient more closely to promote efficacy. For example more efficacious drugs are desirable for better patient treatment and may provide the possibility of lowered dosing and or dosing frequencies.

The inventor analysed amino acid variability and distribution amongst large representative human samples. The result of the analysis for example antibody gene segments is shown in Table 9.

In a first example the inventor identified the possibility of addressing the rarer IGH gamma 1 SNPs 204D observed cumulative frequency of 0.296 and 206L observed cumulative frequency of 0.283 individually or in combination. These residues are part of the CH3 domain and as such they form part of antibody Fc regions.

Some embodiments of the technology described herein can be defined according to any of the following numbered paragraphs 

Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 PCSK9 is a serine protease involved in regulating the levels of the low density lipoprotein receptor LDLR protein Horton et al. 2007 Seidah and Prat 2007 . In vitro experiments have shown that adding PCSK9 to HepG2 cells lowers the levels of cell surface LDLR Benjannet et al. 2004 Lagace et al. 2006 Maxwell et al. 2005 Park et al. 2004 . Experiments with mice have shown that increasing PCSK9 protein levels decreases levels of LDLR protein in the liver Benjannet et al. 2004 Lagace et al. 2006 Maxwell et al. 2005 Park et al. 2004 while PCSK9 knockout mice have increased levels of LDLR in the liver Rashid et al. 2005 . Additionally various human PCSK9 mutations that result in either increased or decreased levels of plasma LDL have been identified Kotowski et al. 2006 Zhao et al. 2006 . PCSK9 has been shown to directly interact with the LDLR protein be endocytosed along with the LDLR and co immunofluoresce with the LDLR throughout the endosomal pathway Lagace et al. 2006 .

PCSK9 is a prohormone proprotein convertase in the subtilisin S8 family of serine proteases Seidah et al. 2003 . Humans have nine prohormone proprotein convertases that can be divided between the S8A and S8B subfamilies Rawlings et al. 2006 . Furin PC1 PC3 PC2 PACE4 PC4 PC5 PC6 and PC7 PC8 LPC SPC7 are classified in subfamily S8B. Crystal and NMR structures of different domains from mouse furin and PC1 reveal subtilisin like pro and catalytic domains and a P domain directly C terminal to the catalytic domain Henrich et al. 2003 Tangrea et al. 2002 . Based on the amino acid sequence similarity within this subfamily all seven members are predicted to have similar structures Henrich et al. 2005 . SKI 1 S1P and PCSK9 are classified in subfamily SBA. Sequence comparisons with these proteins also suggest the presence of subtilisin like pro and catalytic domains Sakai et al. 1998 Seidah et al. 2003 Seidah et al. 1999 . In these proteins the amino acid sequence C terminal to the catalytic domain is more variable and does not suggest the presence of a P domain.

Prohormone proprotein convertases are expressed as zymogens and they mature through a multi step process. The function of the pro domain in this process is two fold. The pro domain first acts as a chaperone and is required for proper folding of the catalytic domain Ikemura et al. 1987 . Once the catalytic domain is folded autocatalysis occurs between the pro domain and catalytic domain. Following this initial cleavage reaction the pro domain remains bound to the catalytic domain where it then acts as an inhibitor of catalytic activity Fu et al. 2000 . When conditions are correct maturation proceeds with a second autocatalytic event at a site within the pro domain Anderson et al. 1997 . After this second cleavage event occurs the pro domain and catalytic domain dissociate giving rise to an active protease.

Autocatalysis of the PCSK9 zymogen occurs between Gln152 and Ser153 VFAQ SIP SEQ ID NO 116 Naureckiene et al. 2003 and has been shown to be required for its secretion from cells Seidah et al. 2003 . A second autocatalytic event at a site within PCSK9 s pro domain has not been observed. Purified PCSK9 is made up of two species that can be separated by non reducing SDS PAGE the pro domain at 17 Kd and the catalytic plus C terminal domains at 65 Kd. PCSK9 has not been isolated without its inhibitory pro domain and measurements of PCSK9 s catalytic activity have been variable Naureckiene et al. 2003 Seidah et al. 2003 .

In certain embodiments a PCSK9 polypeptide includes terminal residues such as but not limited to leader sequence residues targeting residues amino terminal methionine residues lysine residues tag residues and or fusion protein residues. PCSK9 has also been referred to as FH3 NARC1 HCHOLA3 proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 and neural apoptosis regulated convertase 1. The PCSK9 gene encodes a proprotein convertase protein that belongs to the proteinase K subfamily of the secretory subtilase family. The term PCSK9 denotes both the proprotein and the product generated following autocatalysis of the proprotein. When only the autocatalyzed product is being referred to such as for an antigen binding protein or ligand that binds to the cleaved PCSK9 the protein can be referred to as the mature cleaved processed or active PCSK9. When only the inactive form is being referred to the protein can be referred to as the inactive pro form or unprocessed form of PCSK9. The term PCSK9 also encompasses PCSK9 molecules incorporating post translational modifications of the PCSK9 amino acid sequence such as PCSK9 sequences that have been glycosylated PCSK9 sequences from which its signal sequence has been cleaved PCSK9 sequence from which its pro domain has been cleaved from the catalytic domain but not separated from the catalytic domain see e.g. FIGS. 1A and 1B of US20120093818A1 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety .

The present invention provides anti PCSK9 ligands and PCSK9 binding or targeting ligands as described herein. The ligands have a variety of utilities. Some of the ligands for instance are useful in specific binding assays for genotyping or phenotyping humans affinity purification of PCSK9 in particular human PCSK9 or its ligands and in screening assays to identify other antagonists of PCSK9 activity. Some of the ligands of the invention are useful for inhibiting binding of PCSK9 to LDLR or inhibiting PCSK9 mediated activities.

Anti PCSK9 ligands eg antibodies and anti sense RNA have been developed based on targeting and neutralising so called wild type human PCSK9 which is a commonly occurring form see eg US20120093818A1 and US20110065902A1 each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . While such therapies are useful for human patients harbouring this form of human PCSK9 the inventor considered it useful to investigate the possibility of targeting much rarer but still naturally occurring forms of PCSK9 amongst human populations. In this way the inventor arrived at insight into the natural occurrences and distributions of rarer human PCSK9 forms that can serve as useful targets at the protein or nucleic acid level for human treatment prophylaxis and diagnosis pertinent to diseases and conditions mediated or associated with PCSK9 activity. This particularly provides for tailored therapies prophylaxis and diagnosis in humans that are devoid of the common PCSK9 gene or protein ie the form a or a as used in US20120093818A1 and US20110065902A1 to generate antibodies .

The skilled person will know that SNPs or other changes that translate into amino acid variation can cause variability in activity and or conformation of human targets to be addressed. This has spawned great interest in personalized medicine where genotyping and knowledge of protein and nucleotide variability is used to more effectively tailor medicines and diagnosis of patients. The invention therefore provides for tailored pharmaceuticals and testing that specifically addresses rarer PCSK9 polymorphic variant forms. Such forms or alleles at the nucleotide level in many of the examples determined by the inventor comprise multiple changes at the nucleotide and amino acid levels from the corresponding common form nucleotide and amino acids sequences ie there are multiple non synonymous changes at the nucleotide level that translate into multiple corresponding changes in the protein target in humans.

Furthermore the inventor surprisingly realised that the rarer natural forms although present in humans at much lower frequencies than the common form nevertheless are represented in multiple and ethnically diverse human populations and usually with many human examples per represented ethnic population. Thus the inventor realised that targeting such rarer forms would provide for effective treatment prophylaxis or diagnosis across many human ethnic populations thereby extending the utility of the present invention.

With this realisation the inventor realised that there is significant industrial and medical application for the invention in terms of guiding the choice of anti PCSK9 ligand for administration to human patients for therapy and or prophylaxis of PCSK9 mediated or associated diseases or conditions. In this way the patient receives drugs and ligands that are tailored to their needs as determined by the patient s genetic or phenotypic makeup. Hand in hand with this the invention provides for the genotyping and or phenotyping of patients in connection with such treatment thereby allowing a proper match of drug to patient. This increases the chances of medical efficacy reduces the likelihood of inferior treatment using drugs or ligands that are not matched to the patient eg poor efficacy and or side effects and avoids pharmaceutical mis prescription and waste.

In developing this thinking the present inventor decided to determine a set of human PCSK9 variants on the basis of the following criteria these being criteria that the inventor realised would provide for useful medical drugs and diagnostics to tailored need in the human population. The inventor selected variants having at least 3 of the 4 following criteria 

On the basis of these criteria the inventor identified the variants listed in Table 1 below excluding form a .

The invention provides therapeutic methods for treating a human patient in need of a composition or ligand of the invention. While modifications in lifestyle and conventional drug treatment are often successful in reducing cholesterol levels not all patients are able to achieve the recommended target cholesterol levels with such approaches. Various conditions such as familial hypercholesterolemia FH appear to be resistant to lowering of LDL C levels in spite of aggressive use of conventional therapy. Homozygous and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia hoFH heFH is a condition associated with premature atherosclerotic vascular disease. However patients diagnosed with hoFH are largely unresponsive to conventional drug therapy and have limited treatment options. Specifically treatment with statins which reduce LDL C by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis and upregulating the hepatic LDL receptor may have little effect in patients whose LDL receptors are non existent or defective. A mean LDL C reduction of only less than about 20 has been recently reported in patients with genotype confirmed hoFH treated with the maximal dose of statins. The addition of ezetimibe 10 mg day to this regimen resulted in a total reduction of LDL C levels of 27 which is still far from optimal. Likewise many patients are statin non responsive poorly controlled with statin therapy or cannot tolerate statin therapy in general these patients are unable to achieve cholesterol control with alternative treatments. There is a large unmet medical need for new treatments that can address the short comings of current treatment options.

Specific populations treatable by the therapeutic methods of the invention include patients indicated for LDL apheresis subjects with PCSK9 activating GOF mutations heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia heFH subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia who are statin intolerant or statin uncontrolled and subjects at risk for developing hypercholesterolemia who may be preventably treated.

In an example of any aspect of the invention the ligand eg antibody or fragment eg alirocumab bocovizumab or evolocumab or an antibody or fragment comprising the variable domains of 316P or 31H4 is administered to the human at a two weekly dose of from 75 to 150 mg eg from 75 to 150 mg administered once or twice over a two week period . In an example the ligand is for such administration to the human.

Binding of the antibodies to the PCSK9 variants was carried out by SPR using the ProteOn XPR36 Array system BioRad . An anti human IgG surface Jackson Labs 109 005 008 was created on a GLC Biosensor chip by primary amine coupling. Test antibodies were captured on this surface as ligands. The PCSK9 variants were used as analytes and passed over the captured antibodies at 256 nM 64 nM 16 nM 4 nM and 1 nM. Binding curves were double referenced using a buffer injection i.e. 0 nM to remove baseline drift and injection artefacts. Regeneration of the capture surface was with 100 mM phosphoric acid which removed the captured antibody allowing another cycle of capture and binding. The binding sensorgrams generated were analysed using the 1 1 model inherent to the ProteOn XPR36 Array system analysis software. The assay was performed at 25 C. and using 1 HBS EP Teknova as running buffer.

Three antibodies were tested and the resulting binding data are presented below Table 3 . Antibodies 316P and 31H4 are antibodies disclosed in US20110065902A1 the sequences of these antibodies and their variable domains are incorporated herein by reference for possible use in the present invention and possible inclusion in claims herein . Antibody 316P comprises heavy chain variable domains derived from recombination of human VH3 23 04 and JH2 01 with a D and light chain variable domains derived from recombination of human V 4 1 01 and J 2 01.

Evolocumab comprises a human IGHG2 01 heavy chain and a human IGLC2 01 lambda light chain a VH derived from recombination of human IGHV1 18 01 and IGHJ6 01 with a D segment and a V derived from recombination of human IGLV2 14 01 and IGLJ2 01.

The results showed that all antibodies tested bound to PCSK9 variants equally with any binding variation seen being within experimental error for such a strong affinity interaction.

Thus the invention determines that an antibody with the following profile can specifically bind one or more variants of the invention 

1. An antibody eg 316P or alirocumab that comprises heavy chain variable domains derived from recombination of human IGHV3 23 04 and IGHJH2 01 with a D and light chain variable domains derived from recombination of human IGKV4 1 01 and IGKJ2 01 or

2. An antibody eg evolocumab that comprises human heavy chain variable domains derived from recombination of human IGHV1 18 01 and IGHJ6 01 with a D segment and light chain variable domains derived from recombination of human IGLV2 14 01 and IGLJ2 01.

Thus according to the invention the skilled person is hereby provided with the required determination of specific binding of the ligand to PCSK9 variants. Applications of this determination are set out above in the context of methods and other aspects of the invention.

Interleukin 4 IL 4 also known as B cell stimulating factor or BSF 1 was originally characterized by its ability to stimulate the proliferation of B cells in response to low concentrations of antibodies directed to surface immunoglobulin. IL 4 has been shown to possess a broad spectrum of biological activities including growth stimulation of T cells mast cells granulocytes megakaryocytes and erythrocytes. IL 4 induces the expression of class II major histocompatibility complex molecules in resting B cells and enhances the secretion of IgE and IgGI isotypes by stimulated B cells

In an example the invention provides a method of treating or reducing the risk of an IL4Ra mediated disease or condition in a human in need thereof the method comprising administering to said human a ligand eg an antibody or antibody fragment that specifically binds a human IL4RA protein. The invention also provides a corresponding ligand.

The present invention provides anti IL4Ra ligands and IL4Ra binding or targeting ligands as described herein. The ligands have a variety of utilities. Some of the ligands for instance are useful in specific binding assays for genotyping or phenotyping humans affinity purification of IL4Ra in particular human IL4Ra or its ligands and in screening assays to identify other antagonists of IL4Ra activity. Some of the ligands of the invention are useful for inhibiting binding of IL4Ra to IL4 or inhibiting IL4Ra mediated activities.

Anti IL4Ra ligands eg antibodies and anti sense RNA have been developed based on targeting and neutralising so called wild type human IL4Ra which is a commonly occurring form see eg SEQ ID NO 67 . While such therapies are useful for human patients harbouring this form of human IL4RA the inventor considered it useful to investigate the possibility of targeting rarer but still naturally occurring forms of IL4Ra amongst human populations. In this way the inventor arrived at insight into the natural occurrences and distributions of rarer human IL4Ra forms that can serve as useful targets at the protein or nucleic acid level for human treatment prophylaxis and diagnosis pertinent to diseases and conditions mediated or associated with IL4RA activity. This particularly provides for tailored therapies prophylaxis and diagnosis in humans that are devoid of the common IL4Ra gene or protein.

The skilled person will know that SNPs or other changes that translate into amino acid variation can cause variability in activity and or conformation of human targets to be addressed. This has spawned great interest in personalized medicine where genotyping and knowledge of protein and nucleotide variability is used to more effectively tailor medicines and diagnosis of patients. The invention therefore provides for tailored pharmaceuticals and testing that specifically addresses rarer IL4Ra polymorphic variant forms. Such forms or alleles at the nucleotide level comprise one or more changes at the nucleotide and amino acid levels from the corresponding common form nucleotide and amino acids sequences ie there are one or more non synonymous changes at the nucleotide level that translate into one or more corresponding changes in the protein target in humans.

Furthermore the inventor surprisingly realised that the rarer natural forms although present in humans at much lower frequencies than the common form nevertheless are represented in multiple and ethnically diverse human populations and usually with many human examples per represented ethnic population. Thus the inventor realised that targeting such rarer forms would provide for effective treatment prophylaxis or diagnosis across many human ethnic populations thereby extending the utility of the present invention.

With this realisation the inventor realised that there is significant industrial and medical application for the invention in terms of guiding the choice of anti IL4Ra ligand for administration to human patients for therapy and or prophylaxis of IL4Ra mediated or associated diseases or conditions. In this way the patient receives drugs and ligands that are tailored to their needs as determined by the patient s genetic or phenotypic makeup. Hand in hand with this the invention provides for the genotyping and or phenotyping of patients in connection with such treatment thereby allowing a proper match of drug to patient. This increases the chances of medical efficacy reduces the likelihood of inferior treatment using drugs or ligands that are not matched to the patient eg poor efficacy and or side effects and avoids pharmaceutical mis prescription and waste.

In developing this thinking in this non limiting example the present inventor decided to determine a set of human IL4Ra variants on the basis of the following criteria these being criteria that the inventor realised would provide for useful medical drugs and diagnostics to tailored need in the human population. The inventor selected variants having at least 3 of the 4 following criteria 

Naturally occurring human IL4Ra variation having a total human genotype frequency of about 50 or less 

Naturally occurring human IL4Ra variation found in many different human ethnic populations using the standard categorisation of the 1000 Genomes Project see Table 2 below and

Naturally occurring human IL4Ra variation found in many individuals distributed across such many different ethnic populations.

On the basis of these criteria the inventor identified variants listed in Table 11 below. The inventor s selection included as an additional or alternative consideration selection for nucleotide variation that produced amino acid variation in corresponding IL4Ra forms ie non synonymous variations as opposed to silent variations that do not alter amino acid residues in the target protein.

In an example the invention provides a method of treating or reducing the risk of an IL4Ra mediated disease or condition in a human in need thereof the method comprising administering to said human a ligand eg an antibody or antibody fragment that specifically binds a human IL4RA protein that comprises a mutation selected from the group consisting of I75V E400A C431R S503P Q576R and S752A in SEQ ID NO 67.

The human IL 4Ra aka IL 4Ra subunit Swiss Prot accession number P24394 is a 140 kDa type 1 membrane protein that binds human IL 4 with a high affinity Andrews et al J. Biol. Chem 2002 277 46073 46078 . The IL 4 IL 4Ra complex can dimerize with either the common gamma chain yc CD132 or the IL 13Ralpha1 IL 13Ra1 subunit via domains on IL 4 to create two different signalling complexes commonly referred to as Type I and Type II receptors respectively. Alternatively IL 13 can bind IL 13Ra1 to form an IL 13 IL 13Ra1 complex that recruits the IL 4Ra subunit to form a Type II receptor complex. Thus IL 4Ra mediates the biological activities of both IL 4 and IL 13 reviewed by Gessner et al Immunobiology 201 285 2000 . In vitro studies have shown that IL 4 and IL 13 activate effector functions in a number of cell types for example in T cells B cells eosinophils mast cells basophils airway smooth muscle cells respiratory epithelial cells lung fibroblasts and endothelial cells reviewed by Steinke et al Resp Res 2 66 2001 and by Willis Karp Immunol Rev 202 175 2004 .

IL 4 by binding to its receptor IL 4R is essential for the development of airway inflammation present in asthma through the induction of IgE synthesis in B cells and differentiation of T cells to a Th2 phenotype. Dupilumab is a monoclonal antibody designed for the treatment of atopic diseases. It binds to the alpha subunit of the interleukin 4 receptor. Through blockade of IL 4R alpha dupilumab modulates signaling of both the IL 4 and IL 13 pathway which have been implicated in the pathophysiology of allergic disease. Anti IL4Ra ligands antibodies and fragments according to the invention can for example be used for treating or reducing the risk of allergic disease.

In an example the ligand antibody or fragment is for treating or reducing the risk of or treats or reduces the risk of allergic asthma eosinophilic asthma or atopic dermatitis optionally wherein the antibody is dupilumab.

In addition to its role in asthma IL 4Ra has been linked with a number of other pathologies e.g. as follows anti IL4Ra ligands antibodies and fragments according to the invention can for example be used for treating or reducing the risk of any one of these diseases or conditions 

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease COPD includes patient populations with varying degrees of chronic bronchitis small airway disease and emphysema and is characterised by progressive irreversible lung function decline that responds poorly to current asthma based therapy. The underlying causes of COPD remain poorly understood. The Dutch hypothesis proposes that there is a common susceptibility to COPD and asthma and therefore that similar mechanisms may contribute to the pathogenesis of both disorders Sluiter et al. Eur Respir J . Zheng et al J Clin Invest 106 9 1081 93 2000 have demonstrated that overexpression oflL 13 in the mouse lung caused emphysema elevated mucus production and inflammation reflecting aspects of human COPD. Furthermore AHR an IL 13 dependent response in murine models of allergic inflammation has been shown to be predictive of lung function decline in smokers Tashkin et al. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 153 6 Pt 1 1802 11 1996 . A link has also been established between an IL 13 promoter polymorphism and susceptibility to develop COPD Van Der Pouw Kraan et al. Genes Immun 3 7 436 9 2002 . The signs are therefore that IL 4 IL 13 pathway and in particular IL 13 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of COPD.

In addition to asthma the IL 4 11 13 pathway has been linked to other fibrotic conditions like systemic sclerosis Hasegawa et al. J Rheumatol 24 2 328 32 1997 pulmonary fibrosis Hancock et al. Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol 18 1 60 5 1998 parasite induced liver fibrosis Fallon et al. J Immunol 164 5 2585 91 2000 Chiaramonte et al. J Clin Invest 104 6 777 85 1999 Chiaramonte Hepatology 34 2 273 82 2001 and cystic fibrosis Hauber et al. J. Cyst Fibr 2 189 2003 .

IL 4 and to some extent IL 13 are crucial for B cell mediated activities such as B cell proliferation immunoglobulin secretion and expression of FcepsilonR. Clinical applications of an IL 4Ra inhibitor include for example use in allergy therapy to suppress IgE synthesis including for example atopic dermatitis and food allergy use in transplation therapy to prevent transplant rejection as well as suppression of delayed type hypersensitivity or contact hypersensitivity reactions.

IL 4Ra polymorphisms in the human population have been described reviewed by Gessner et al Immunobiology 201 285 2000 and association with IgE levels or clinical atopy has been reported in some populations. For instance V75R576 IL 4Ra is associated with allergic asthma and enhanced IL 4Ra function Risma et al. J. Immunol. 169 3 1604 1610 2002 .

Anti IL4Ra ligands antibodies and fragments according to the invention optionally neutralise IL 4Ra with high potency for example as described in more detail in the Examples of EP2604628. Neutralisation means inhibition of a biological activity mediated by IL 4Ra. Ligands antibodies and fragments according to the invention may neutralise one or more activities mediated by IL 4Ra. The inhibited biological activity is likely mediated by prevention of IL 4Ra forming a signalling complex with gamma chain or IL 13Ra and either of the associated soluble ligands e.g. IL 4 or IL 13.

Neutralisation of IL 4 or IL 13 signalling through its IL 4Ra containing receptor complex may be measured by inhibition of IL 4 or IL 13 stimulated TF 1 cell proliferation.

Reference is made to J Clin Invest. 2007 December 117 12 3603 9 Mutations in sodium channel gene SCN9A cause a spectrum of human genetic pain disorders Drenth JP Waxman SG incorporated herein by reference . Voltage gated sodium channels play a critical role in the generation and conduction of action potentials and are thus important for electrical signalling by most excitable cells. Sodium channels are integral membrane proteins and are comprised of a large a subunit which forms the voltage sensitive and ion selective pore and smaller auxiliary subunit s that can modulate the kinetics and voltage dependence of channel gating. To date we know of 9 isoforms of the sodium channel a subunit Nav1.1 Nav1.9 each with a unique central and peripheral nervous system distribution. Four closely related sodium channels Nav1.1 1.2 1.3 and 1.7 are encoded by a set of 4 genes SCN1A SCN2A SCN3A and SCN9A respectively located within a cluster on chromosome 2q24.3. Nav1.7 has a critical role in pain sensation. Furthermore from KO studies and animal pain models it would appear that Nav1.7 plays a major role in inflammatory pain.

Nav1.7 is located in peripheral neurons and plays an important role in action potential production in these cells. Recent genetic studies have identified Nav1.7 dysfunction in three different human pain disorders. Gain of function missense mutations in Nav1.7 have been shown to cause primary erythermalgia PE and paroxysmal extreme pain disorder PEPD while nonsense mutations in Nav1.7 result in loss of Nav1.7 function and a condition known as channelopathy associated insensitivity to pain CIP a rare disorder in which affected individuals are unable to feel physical pain. Recent work has shown that different types of channelopathies diseases caused by disturbed function of ion channel subunits or the proteins that regulate them all involving the same Nav1.7 sodium channel underlie these disorders.

Nav1.7 is encoded by SCN9A a 113.5 kb gene comprising 26 exons OMIM 603415 Drenth Waxman The encoded sodium channel is composed of 1977 amino acids organized into 4 domains each with 6 transmembrane segments and is predominantly expressed in the dorsal root ganglion DRG neurons and sympathetic ganglion neurons Drenth Waxman Immunohistochemical studies show that Nav1.7 is present at the distal ends of the wire like projections of neurons known as neurites close to the impulse trigger zone where neuronal firing is initiated. Interestingly the large majority of DRG neurons that express Nav1.7 are pain sensing nociceptive suggesting a role for this sodium channel in the pathogenesis of pain.

Cell. 2014 Jun. 5 157 6 1393 404. doi 10.1016 j.cell.2014.03.064. Epub 2014 May 22 A monoclonal antibody that targets a NaV1.7 channel voltage sensor for pain and itch relief Lee J H et al and 2011 both incorporated herein by reference describe the generation of a monoclonal antibody against human Nav1.7.

In an example the invention provides a method of treating or reducing the risk of a Nav1.7 mediated disease or condition in a human in need thereof the method comprising administering to said human a ligand eg an antibody or antibody fragment that specifically binds a human Nav1.7 protein. The invention also provides a corresponding ligand.

The present invention provides anti Nav1.7 ligands and Nav1.7 binding or targeting ligands as described herein. The ligands have a variety of utilities. Some of the ligands for instance are useful in specific binding assays for genotyping or phenotyping humans affinity purification of Nav1.7 in particular human Nav1.7 or its ligands and in screening assays to identify other antagonists of Nav1.7 activity. Some of the ligands of the invention are useful for inhibiting Nav1.7 mediated activities.

Anti Nav1.7 ligands eg antibodies and anti sense RNA have been developed based on targeting and neutralising so called wild type human Nav1.7 which is a commonly occurring form see eg SEQ ID NO 75 . While such therapies are useful for human patients harbouring this form of human NAV1.7 the inventor considered it useful to investigate the possibility of targeting rarer but still naturally occurring forms of Nav1.7 amongst human populations. In this way the inventor arrived at insight into the natural occurrences and distributions of rarer human Nav1.7 forms that can serve as useful targets at the protein or nucleic acid level for human treatment prophylaxis and diagnosis pertinent to diseases and conditions mediated or associated with NAV1.7 activity. This particularly provides for tailored therapies prophylaxis and diagnosis in humans that are devoid of the common Nav1.7 gene or protein.

The skilled person will know that SNPs or other changes that translate into amino acid variation can cause variability in activity and or conformation of human targets to be addressed. This has spawned great interest in personalized medicine where genotyping and knowledge of protein and nucleotide variability is used to more effectively tailor medicines and diagnosis of patients. The invention therefore provides for tailored pharmaceuticals and testing that specifically addresses rarer Nav1.7 polymorphic variant forms. Such forms or alleles at the nucleotide level comprise one or more changes at the nucleotide and amino acid levels from the corresponding common form nucleotide and amino acids sequences ie there are one or more non synonymous aka missense changes at the nucleotide level that translate into one or more corresponding changes in the protein target in humans.

Furthermore the inventor surprisingly realised that the rarer natural forms although present in humans at much lower frequencies than the common form nevertheless are represented in multiple and ethnically diverse human populations and usually with many human examples per represented ethnic population. Thus the inventor realised that targeting such rarer forms would provide for effective treatment prophylaxis or diagnosis across many human ethnic populations thereby extending the utility of the present invention.

With this realisation the inventor saw that there is significant industrial and medical application for the invention in terms of guiding the choice of anti Nav1.7 ligand for administration to human patients for therapy and or prophylaxis of Nav1.7 mediated or associated diseases or conditions. In this way the patient receives drugs and ligands that are tailored to their needs as determined by the patient s genetic or phenotypic makeup. Hand in hand with this the invention provides for the genotyping and or phenotyping of patients in connection with such treatment thereby allowing a proper match of drug to patient. This increases the chances of medical efficacy reduces the likelihood of inferior treatment using drugs or ligands that are not matched to the patient eg poor efficacy and or side effects and avoids pharmaceutical mis prescription and waste.

In developing this thinking in this non limiting example the present inventor decided to determine a set of human Nav1.7 variants on the basis of the following criteria these being criteria that the inventor realised would provide for useful medical drugs and diagnostics to tailored need in the human population. The inventor selected variants having at least 3 of the 4 following criteria

chain constant regions encoded by said first constant region gene segment. xvi wherein the ligand comprises a human lambda light chain constant region encoded by a first human lambda light chain constant region gene segment and wherein said human comprises i said first constant region gene segment or the human expresses antibodies comprising human lambda light chain constant regions encoded by said first constant region gene segment.

These examples although written in the context of the present Nav1.7 example are applicable to the invention as it relates to any other TOI herein and thus can be combined and used in claims herein relating to any TOI. In any of these example the ligand is optionally an antibody eg a human or humanised antibody eg a humanised mouse rat or Camelid antibody .

Thus it may be advantageous for Nav1.7 ligands for the ligand to comprise a gamma 4 or gamma 2 constant region eg as per the examples above . For example the gamma 4 is an IgG4PE ie a gamma 4 constant region with 228Pro and 235Glu . For example the gamma 2 is an IgG2 a.

For example as per example ix the inventor identified the possibility of addressing IGH gamma 4 variation and identified utility for variations 189L and 289R individually or in combination since these residues are part of the CH3 domain and as such they form part of antibody Fc regions. Thus matching of these CH3 variations with the patient is especially beneficial for reasons as discussed above. Thus in this example the ligand of the invention comprises or consists of an antibody that comprises a human gamma 4 heavy chain constant region that comprises a Leu corresponding to position 189 of SEQ ID NO 73 or an Arg corresponding to position 289 of SEQ ID NO 73 and wherein the genome of the human comprises a gamma 4 heavy chain constant region nucleotide sequence that encodes such a Leu and or Arg or the human expresses antibodies comprising human gamma 4 constant regions comprising such a Leu and or Arg.

The specific binding of ligands of the invention to Nav1.7 variants can be performed using the SPR method described in Example 1.

Preferably herein the Nav1.7 mutation is 1161W also known as 1150W in some publications eg Reimann et al Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2010 Mar. 16 107 11 5148 53. doi 10.1073 pnas.0913181107.

This describes the correlation of 1150W ie 1161W with increased pain perception lower threshold in normal humans.

The present invention provides anti IL6R ligands and IL6R binding or targeting ligands as described herein. The ligands have a variety of utilities. Some of the ligands for instance are useful in specific binding assays for genotyping or phenotyping humans affinity purification of IL6R in particular human IL6R or its ligands and in screening assays to identify other antagonists of IL6R activity. Some of the ligands of the invention are useful for inhibiting binding of IL6R to IL6 and or gp130 or inhibiting IL6R mediated activities.

Anti IL6R ligands eg antibodies and anti sense RNA have been developed based on targeting and neutralising so called wild type human IL6R which is a commonly occurring form see eg SEQ ID NO 78 . While such therapies are useful for human patients harbouring this form of human IL6R the inventor considered it useful to investigate the possibility of targeting rarer but still naturally occurring forms of IL6R amongst human populations. In this way the inventor arrived at insight into the natural occurrences and distributions of rarer human IL6R forms that can serve as useful targets at the protein or nucleic acid level for human treatment prophylaxis and diagnosis pertinent to diseases and conditions mediated or associated with IL6R activity. This particularly provides for tailored therapies prophylaxis and diagnosis in humans that are devoid of the common IL6R gene or protein.

The skilled person will know that SNPs or other changes that translate into amino acid variation can cause variability in activity and or conformation of human targets to be addressed. This has spawned great interest in personalized medicine where genotyping and knowledge of protein and nucleotide variability is used to more effectively tailor medicines and diagnosis of patients. The invention therefore provides for tailored pharmaceuticals and testing that specifically addresses rarer IL6R polymorphic variant forms. Such forms or alleles at the nucleotide level comprise one or more changes at the nucleotide and amino acid levels from the corresponding common form nucleotide and amino acids sequences ie there are one or more non synonymous changes at the nucleotide level that translate into one or more corresponding changes in the protein target in humans.

Furthermore the inventor surprisingly realised that the rarer natural forms although present in humans at much lower frequencies than the common form nevertheless are represented in multiple and ethnically diverse human populations and usually with many human examples per represented ethnic population. Thus the inventor realised that targeting such rarer forms would provide for effective treatment prophylaxis or diagnosis across many human ethnic populations thereby extending the utility of the present invention.

With this realisation the inventor realised that there is significant industrial and medical application for the invention in terms of guiding the choice of anti IL6R ligand for administration to human patients for therapy and or prophylaxis of IL6R mediated or associated diseases or conditions. In this way the patient receives drugs and ligands that are tailored to their needs as determined by the patient s genetic or phenotypic makeup. Hand in hand with this the invention provides for the genotyping and or phenotyping of patients in connection with such treatment thereby allowing a proper match of drug to patient. This increases the chances of medical efficacy reduces the likelihood of inferior treatment using drugs or ligands that are not matched to the patient eg poor efficacy and or side effects and avoids pharmaceutical mis prescription and waste.

In developing this thinking in this non limiting example the present inventor decided to determine a set of human IL6R variants on the basis of the following criteria these being criteria that the inventor realised would provide for useful medical drugs and diagnostics to tailored need in the human population. The inventor selected variants having at least 3 of the 4 following criteria 

On the basis of these criteria the inventor identified the variants listed in Table 13 below. The inventor s selection included as a consideration selection for nucleotide variation that produced amino acid variation in corresponding IL6R forms ie non synonymous variations as opposed to silent variations that do not alter amino acid residues in the target protein.

As outlined above the invention includes the possibility to tailor treatment of humans further by selecting antibody based ligands with variable and or constant domains based on gene segments found in many humans of the ethnic populations where the variant IL6R forms are found to meet the selection criteria of the invention. An example is provided for ligands comprising antibody VH domains derived from recombination of human IGHV gene segments comprising selected nucleotides at positions in the HCDR1 or FW3 where there is variability in humans ie where SNPs occur in humans .

The inventor analysed human IGHV variation and used this to choose ligands based on human IGHV alleles comprising said selected nucleotides and for matching to human recipient genotypes and or phenotypes. The inventor identified utility in using gene VH gene segments encoding i a CDR1 comprising a Phe at position 4 shown in SEQ ID NO 109 and wherein said human comprises a VH gene segment encoding a CDR1 comprising a Phe at position 4 shown in SEQ ID NO 109 or the human expresses VH domains that comprise a CDR1 comprising a Phe at position 4 shown in SEQ ID NO 109 or ii a FW3 comprising a Thr at position 33 shown in SEQ ID NO 111 and wherein said human comprises a VH gene segment encoding a FW3 comprising a Thr at position 33 shown in SEQ ID NO 111 or the human expresses VH domains that comprise a FW3 comprising a Thr at position 33 shown in SEQ ID NO 111. Further information is provided in Table 14 which shows variation at these positions as well as the variant distributions across the 1000 Genomes Project database relating to many human populations.

In other embodiments as explained more fully above the invention provides for ligands which are tailored to the human recipient s genotype and or phenotype based on alternative human VH gene segments or on V V or constant region gene segments see further Table 16 for representative variants .

 i wherein the ligand comprises a VH domain derived from the recombination of human VH segment IGHV3 7 01 a human D gene segment and a human JH segment and wherein said human comprises a IGHV3 7 01 VH gene segment or the human expresses VH domains derived from the recombination of human VH segment IGHV3 7 01 a human D gene segment and a human JH segment. ii wherein the ligand comprises a V domain derived from the recombination of human V segment IGKV1 12 01 and a human J segment and wherein said human comprises a IGKV1 12 01 V gene segment or the human expresses V domains derived from the recombination of human V segment IGKV1 12 01 and a human J segment. iii wherein the ligand comprises a V domain derived from the recombination of a human V segment and a human J segment the human V segment encoding i a CDR3 comprising a Pro at position 7 shown in SEQ ID NO 113 and wherein said human comprises a V gene segment encoding a CDR3 comprising a Pro at position 7 shown in SEQ ID NO 113 or the human expresses V domains that comprise a CDR3 comprising a Pro at position 7 shown in SEQ ID NO 113 or ii a FW3 comprising a Ser at position 15 shown in SEQ ID NO 115 and wherein said human comprises a V gene segment encoding a FW3 comprising a Ser at position 15 shown in SEQ ID NO 115 or the human expresses V domains that comprise a FW3 comprising a Ser at position 15 shown in SEQ ID NO 115. iv wherein the ligand comprises a human gamma 1 heavy chain constant region that comprises an Asp at position 204 shown in SEQ ID NO 81 or a Leu at position 206 shown in SEQ ID NO 81 and wherein said human comprises i an IGHG1 01 human heavy chain constant region gene segment or the human expresses antibodies comprising human gamma 1 heavy chain constant regions comprising an Asp at position 204 shown in SEQ ID NO 81 or a Leu at position 206 shown in SEQ ID NO 81. v wherein the ligand comprises a human gamma 2 heavy chain constant region that comprises an amino acid selected from the group consisting of a Pro at position 72 shown in SEQ ID NO 83 an Asn at position 75 shown in SEQ ID NO 83 a Phe at position 76 shown in SEQ ID NO 83 a Val at position 161 shown in SEQ ID NO 83 and an Ala at position 257 shown in SEQ ID NO 83 and wherein said human comprises i an IGHG2 01 human heavy chain constant region gene segment or the human expresses antibodies comprising human gamma 2 heavy chain constant regions comprising said selected Pro at position 72 shown in SEQ ID NO 83 Asn at position 75 shown in SEQ ID NO 83 Phe at position 76 shown in SEQ ID NO 83 Val at position 161 shown in SEQ ID NO 83 or Ala at position 257 shown in SEQ ID NO 83. vi wherein the ligand comprises a human kappa chain constant region that comprises a Val at position 84 shown in SEQ ID NO 93 or a Cys at position 87 shown in SEQ ID NO 93 and wherein said human comprises i an IGKC1 01 human kappa chain constant region gene segment or the human expresses antibodies comprising human kappa chain constant regions comprising a Val corresponding to position 84 shown in SEQ ID NO 93 or a Cys at position 87 shown in SEQ ID NO 93. vii wherein the ligand comprises a human IGLC1 01 lambda chain constant region and wherein said human comprises i a human IGLC1 01 lambda chain constant region gene segment or the human expresses antibodies comprising human IGLC1 01 lambda chain constant regions.

For example as per example iv the inventor identified the possibility of addressing the rarer IGH gamma 1 SNPs 204D observed cumulative frequency of 0.296 and 206L observed cumulative frequency of 0.283 individually or in combination. These residues are part of the CH3 domain and as such they form part of antibody Fc regions. Thus matching of these CH3 variations with the patient is especially beneficial for reasons as discussed above. Thus in this example the ligand of the invention comprises or consists of an antibody that comprises a human gamma 1 heavy chain constant region that comprises an Asp corresponding to position 204 of SEQ ID NO 81 or a Leu corresponding to position 206 of SEQ ID NO 81 and wherein the genome of the human comprises a gamma 1 heavy chain constant region nucleotide sequence that encodes such an Asp or Leu or the human expresses antibodies comprising human gamma 1 constant regions comprising such an Asp or Leu. An example of such a ligand is sarilumab.

In another example as per example v the inventor identified the possibility of addressing IGH gamma 2 SNPs. This included consideration of Fc region variation in this respect the inventor focused on positions 161 and 257 which are in the Fc region. Thus in this example the ligand of the invention comprises or consists of an antibody that comprises a human gamma 2 heavy chain constant region that comprises an amino acid selected from the group consisting of a Pro corresponding to position 72 of SEQ ID NO 83 an Asn corresponding to position 75 of SEQ ID NO 83 a Phe corresponding to position 76 of SEQ ID NO 83 a Val corresponding to position 161 of SEQ ID NO 83 and an Ala corresponding to position 257 of SEQ ID NO 83 and wherein the genome of the human comprises a gamma 2 heavy chain constant region nucleotide sequence that encodes such a selected amino acid or the human expresses antibodies comprising human gamma 2 constant regions comprising such a selected amino acid.

In another example as per example vi the inventor addressed human kappa constant region variation. Thus in this example the ligand of the invention comprises or consists of an antibody that comprises a human kappa light chain constant region that comprises a Val corresponding to position 84 of SEQ ID NO 93 or a Cys corresponding to position 87 of SEQ ID NO 93 and wherein the genome of the human comprises a kappa light chain constant region nucleotide sequence that encodes such a Val or Cys or the human expresses antibodies comprising human kappa light chain constant regions comprising such a Val or Cys. An example of such a ligand is sarilumab.

In another example as per example vii the inventor addressed human lambda constant region variation. Thus in this example the ligand of the invention comprises or consists of an antibody that comprises a human IGLC2 01 light chain constant region and wherein the genome of the human comprises a human IGLC2 01 nucleotide sequence or the human expresses antibodies comprising human light chain IGLC2 01 constant regions.

The specific binding of ligands of the invention to IL6R variants can be performed using the following method.

Binding of the antibodies to the IL6R variants is carried out by SPR using the ProteOn XPR36 Array system BioRad . An anti human IgG surface Jackson Labs 109 005 008 was created on a GLC Biosensor chip by primary amine coupling. Test antibodies are captured on this surface as ligands. The IL6R variants are used as analytes and passed over the captured antibodies at 256 nM 64 nM 16 nM 4 nM and 1 nM. Binding curves are double referenced using a buffer injection i.e. 0 nM to remove baseline drift and injection artefacts. Regeneration of the capture surface is with 100 mM phosphoric acid which removes the captured antibody allowing another cycle of capture and binding. The binding sensorgrams generated are analysed using the 1 1 model inherent to the ProteOn XPR36 Array system analysis software. The assay is performed at 25 C. and using 1xHBS EP Teknova as running buffer.

VEGF A is also referred to as VEGF Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A MVCD1 VEGF A Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Vascular Permeability Factor and VPF. Human VEGF A binds to the human FLT1 VEGFR1 and KDR VEGFR2 receptors. Human isoforms including VEGF 165 and VEGF 145 have been observed.

Vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF is a highly specific mitogen for vascular endothelial cells. Five VEGF isoforms are generated as a result of alternative splicing from a single VEGF gene. These isoforms differ in their molecular mass and in biological properties such as their ability to bind to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. The expression of VEGF is potentiated in response to hypoxia by activated oncogenes and by a variety of cytokines. VEGF induces endothelial cell proliferation promotes cell migration and inhibits apoptosis. In vivo VEGF induces angiogenesis as well as permeabilization of blood vessels and plays a central role in the regulation of vasculogenesis. Deregulated VEGF expression contributes to the development of solid tumours by promoting tumour angiogenesis and to the etiology of several additional diseases that are characterized by abnormal angiogenesis. Consequently inhibition of VEGF signalling abrogates the development of a wide variety of tumours. The various VEGF forms bind to two tyrosine kinase receptors VEGFR 1 flt 1 and VEGFR 2 KDR flk 1 in humans which are expressed almost exclusively in endothelial cells. Endothelial cells express in addition the neuropilin 1 and neuropilin 2 coreceptors which bind selectively to the 165 amino acid form of VEGF VEGF165 .

VEGF is a key regulator of angiogenesis and its expression in producing cells is regulated by a plethora of external factors. Cytokines growth factors and gonadotropins that do not stimulate angiogenesis directly can modulate angiogenesis by modulating VEGF expression in specific cell types and thus exert an indirect angiogenic or anti angiogenic effect. Factors that can potentiate VEGF production include fibroblast growth factor 4 FGF 4 PDGF tumour necrosis factor transforming growth factor TGF keratinocyte growth factor KGF IGF I interleukin 1 IL 1 and IL 6.

Angiogenesis has a causal role in many diseases including neovascular age related macular degeneration AMD . Identification of key regulators of angiogenesis including vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF fibroblast growth factor 2 pigment epithelium derived growth factor angiopoietins and extracellular matrix molecules has facilitated the development of novel therapeutic agents that target the underlying pathological angiogenic process. Among these VEGF serves as a master switch for many ocular neovascular conditions through its promotion of endothelial cell proliferation and survival vascular permeability and ocular inflammation. Anti VEGF agents are now available such as aflibercept EYLEA bevacizumab AVASTIN ranibizumab LUCENTIS and pegaptanib sodium MACUGEN an aptamer for neovascular AMD. Unlike bevacizumab which binds all VEGF isoforms pegaptanib targets only VEGF165 the isoform responsible for pathological ocular neovascularization.

Flt 1 VEGFR 1 Unitprot ID P17948 is one of the two human receptors for vascular endothelial growth factor. The other being KDR VEGFR 2 Uniprot ID P35968 . The flt 1 protein consists of an external domain containing seven immunoglobulin like domains a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic region containing a tyrosine kinase domain. In contrast to other members of the receptor tyrosine kinase family the kinase domain of flt 1 is in two segments with an intervening sequence of 70 amino acids. The biology of the VEGF receptors has been reviewed Neufeld et al. 1999 FASEB Journal. 13 11 22 Zachary 1998 Experimental Nephrology. 6 480 487 and the tyrosine phosphorylation sites have been identified Ito et al. 1998 J. Biol. Chem. 273 23410 23418 .

It is thought that flt 1 may be important in regulating the tissue architecture in developing vasculature while the second VEGF receptor KDR VEGFR 2 mediates the mitogenic and angiogenic effects of VEGF in endothelial cells. Evidence to support this theory has come from knockout studies in mice Fong et al. 1995 Nature. 376 66 70 . VEGF and its receptors are over expressed in many tumour types and blocking of VEGF function inhibits angiogenesis and suppresses growth of tumours while over expression of VEGF enhances angiogenesis and tumour growth Skobe et al. 1997 Nature Medicine 3 1222 1227 .

The flt 1 cDNA EMBL Accession Number X51602 7680 bp encodes a mature protein of 1338 amino acids. The structure of the murine flt 1 gene has been determined Kondo et al. 1998 Gene 208 297 305 and has been used to predict the intron exon boundaries within the human gene. The promoter region of the human gene has been characterised Ikeda et al. 1996 Growth Factors. 13 151 162 Morishita et al. 1995 J Biol Chem 270 27948 27953 EMBL Accession Number D64016 1745 bp . The flt 1 gene which is organised into thirty exons has been localised to chromosome 1312 Rosnet et al. 1993 Oncogene 8 73 179 . See EP1130123A2.

Diabetic retinopathy DR a micro vascular complication of diabetes is a main cause of blindness in adults. It is well established that DR is determined by both genetic and environmental factors. The longer duration of diabetes poorer control of blood glucose and elevated blood pressure are the major risk factors in the development of DR. However genetic factors also play important roles in the pathogenesis of DR. Over the past three decades the number of people with diabetes mellitus has more than doubled globally making it one of the most important public health challenges to all nations. DR occurs in 75 of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and almost all patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus within 15 years of the manifestation of diabetes. Evidence supports an important role for genetics in determining risk for DR.

VEGF A has been implicated as a major contributor to the development of DR. VEGF A could induce the earliest changes in DR including leukostasis blood retinal barrier breakdown and macular edema and neovascularization in progression of DR. The VEGF A gene is located on human chromosome 6p21.3 and consists of 8 exons. The genetic variants in the VEGF A gene are suggested to influence levels of VEGF A protein expression. To date many studies have investigated the associations between polymorphisms in the VEGF A gene in humans and DR. 634G C 405G C or rs2010963 polymorphism in the 5 untranslated region and 2578C A 25491 D in high linkage disequilibrium with 2578C A or rs699947 polymorphism in the promoter region of the VEGF A gene have been investigated.

Age related macular degeneration AMD is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to visual impairment and accounts for half of all cases of registered blindness in Western individuals older than 65 years of age. There are approximately eight million people in the United States with symptoms of early or intermediate AMD of whom approximately one million will develop advanced AMD within the next five years. AMD is estimated to affect about 50 million people worldwide and an increase in aging populations makes AMD a significant public health concern and a major focus of research efforts. AMD is a clinically heterogeneous and genetically complex disease with multiple environmental and genetic risk factors involved. While epidemiological studies have linked cigarette smoking alcohol consumption light exposure diet drugs and high blood pressure to the risk of AMD familial aggregation and twin studies have suggested that genetic variation may also play an important role in the disease.

Anti VEGF therapies are now regarded as the standard of care in the treatment of neovascular AMD. Two of the most widely used treatments are ranibizumab and bevacizumab. Ranibizumab Lucentis Genentech CA USA a US FDA approved anti VEGF therapy for AMD is a recombinant fragmented monoclonal antibody that binds to VEGF. On the other hand bevacizumab Avastin Genentech although not FDA approved for ocular treatment is a full length monoclonal antibody reportedly with similar function as that of ranibizumab. Bevacizumab FDA approved for metastatic colon cancer has been given as an off label treatment for ocular angiogenic disorders. An individual s genetic variation may affect the treatment response in both of these drugs.

A subset of wet AMD termed polypoidal chorio vasculopathy PCV has been identified as a clinical entity. PCV is important as it may be the main cause of vision loss from AMD in certain Asian and

black populations. The distinctive clinical features of PCV include one or more haemorrhagic pigment epithelial detachments PEDs extensive exudation and disease outside of the macula including the periphery. There is a predilection for peripapillary polyps . Patients are also characteristically younger.

There is increasing evidence that Asian patients with neovascular AMD have a variant of AMD ie polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy PCV which is characterized by polypoidal lesion with inner choroidal vessel abnormality. PCV is more prevalent in Asian subjects reportedly accounting for about 50 of neovascular AMD compared to 10 in Europeans. Studies have shown that anti VEGF therapy ranibizumab in combination with photodynamic therapy PDT was associated with a more favorable outcome compared to ranibizumab monotherapy.

Another variant of AMD in the spectrum of occult CNV is retinal angiomatous proliferation RAP which represents about 12 15 of neovascular AMD. It is associated with proliferation of intraretinal capillaries with retinal anastomosis or CNV.

Diabetic macular edema DME the most common cause of visual loss in subjects with diabetes is a separate classification assessed independently from the DR spectrum because it can develop at any stage of DR. The pathogenesis of DR and DME is thought to be related to the loss of pericytes thickening of basement membrane and endothelial cell loss leading to microaneurysms blood retinal barrier breakdown increase in inflammation and vascular leakage. There are several treatment modalities for DME. The goal of laser treatment of DME is to reduce disease progression by targeting areas of leakage on the retina. Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide IVTA has also been shown to significantly reduce DME with maximal action at one week and lasting 3 6 months.

Retinal vein occlusion RVO is the most common retinal vascular disorder after diabetic retinopathy in the elderly and is often associated with systemic disorders such as hypertension hyperlipidemia diabetes mellitus and or arteriosclerotic vascular disorders. It is classified as branch retinal vein occlusion BRVO or central retinal vein occlusion CRVO depending on the site of occlusion and further divided into ischemic non perfusion or non ischemic perfusion RVO each with differing prognosis and treatment. Macular edema and retinal neovascularization are the two most common causes of visual impairments thus ocular managements with laser photocoagulation intravitreal injections of glucocorticoids or anti VEGF agents as well as other surgical or systemic therapies have focused on these two sequelae.

ROP remains one of the leading causes of childhood blindness. In late stages of ROP neovascularization of abnormal or pathological vessels arise due to retinal immaturity and lead to retinal traction detachment hemorrhage and funnel configuration eventually resulting in poor vision. Neovascularization is mainly driven by VEGF and currently the recommended treatment for Type 1 ROP is peripheral ablation by laser.

Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels. This process involves the migration growth and differentiation of endothelial cells which line the inside wall of blood vessels. The process of angiogenesis is controlled by chemical signals in the body. These signals can stimulate both the repair of damaged blood vessels and the formation of new blood vessels. Other chemical signals called angiogenesis inhibitors interfere with blood vessel formation. Normally the stimulating and inhibiting effects of these chemical signals are balanced so that blood vessels form only when and where they are needed. Neovascularization is the formation of functional microvascular networks with red blood cell perfusion. Neovascularization differs from angiogenesis in that angiogenesis is mainly characterized by the protrusion and outgrowth of capillary buds and sprouts from pre existing blood vessels.

Angiogenesis plays a critical role in the growth and spread of cancer. A blood supply is necessary for tumours to grow beyond a few millimeters in size. Tumours can cause this blood supply to form by giving off chemical signals that stimulate angiogenesis. Tumours can also stimulate nearby normal cells to produce angiogenesis signalling molecules. The resulting new blood vessels feed growing tumours with oxygen and nutrients allowing the cancer cells to invade nearby tissue to move throughout the body and to form new colonies of cancer cells called metastases. Because tumours cannot grow beyond a certain size or spread without a blood supply research is focused on trying to find ways to block tumour angiogenesis with the idea that angiogenesis inhibitors will prevent or slow the growth of cancer. Similarly ocular diseases and conditions such as AMD and DR are associated with angiogenesis and inhibitors are useful for the treatment or prevention of these too.

Thus anti VEGF ie VEGF A ligands and antibodies of the invention are useful for treating preventing or reducing the risk of one or more of such ocular conditions and cancer eg solid tumours .

Angiogenesis requires the binding of signalling molecules such as vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF to receptors on the surface of normal endothelial cells. When VEGF and other endothelial growth factors bind to their receptors on endothelial cells signals within these cells are initiated that promote the growth and survival of new blood vessels. Angiogenesis inhibitors interfere with various steps in this process. For example bevacizumab Avastin is an anti VEGF monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes and binds to VEGF. Aflibercept Eylea is a VEGF receptor Fc fusion that binds VEGF. Other angiogenesis inhibitors including sorafenib and sunitinib bind to receptors on the surface of endothelial cells or to other proteins in the downstream signalling pathways blocking their activities.

In addition to or alternative to targeting human VEGF A to address ocular conditions or cancer or angiogenesis or neovascularisation generally it may be useful to target the platelet derived growth factor pathway eg targeting PDGF B and or PDGFR B or the angiopoietin 2 pathway. Further details are provided below.

The invention also provides a corresponding ligand.

The present invention provides anti VEGF A ligands and VEGF A binding or targeting ligands as described herein. The ligands have a variety of utilities. Some of the ligands for instance are useful in specific binding assays for genotyping or phenotyping humans affinity purification of VEGF A in particular human VEGF A or its ligands and in screening assays to identify other antagonists of VEGF A activity. Some of the ligands of the invention are useful for inhibiting VEGF A mediated activities.

In an example the invention provides a method of treating or reducing the risk of a PDGFR B ie platelet derived growth factor beta receptor mediated disease or condition in a human in need thereof the method comprising administering to said human a ligand eg an antibody or antibody fragment that specifically binds a human PDGFR B protein.

Anti VEGF A ligands eg antibodies and anti sense RNA have been developed based on targeting and neutralising so called wild type human VEGF A which is a commonly occurring form. While such therapies are useful for human patients harbouring this form of human VEGF A the inventor considered it useful to investigate the possibility of targeting rarer but still naturally occurring forms of VEGF A amongst human populations. In this way the inventor arrived at insight into the natural occurrences and distributions of rarer human VEGF A forms that can serve as useful targets at the protein or nucleic acid level for human treatment prophylaxis and diagnosis pertinent to diseases and conditions mediated or associated with VEGF A activity. This particularly provides for tailored therapies prophylaxis and diagnosis in humans that are devoid of the common VEGF A gene or protein.

The skilled person will know that SNPs or other changes that translate into amino acid variation can cause variability in activity and or conformation of human targets to be addressed. This has spawned great interest in personalized medicine where genotyping and knowledge of protein and nucleotide variability is used to more effectively tailor medicines and diagnosis of patients. The invention therefore provides for tailored pharmaceuticals and testing that specifically addresses rarer VEGF A polymorphic variant forms. Such forms or alleles at the nucleotide level comprise one or more changes at the nucleotide and amino acid levels from the corresponding common form nucleotide and amino acids sequences ie there are one or more non synonymous aka missense changes at the nucleotide level that translate into one or more corresponding changes in the protein target in humans.

Furthermore the inventor surprisingly realised that the rarer natural forms although present in humans at much lower frequencies than the common form nevertheless are represented in multiple and ethnically diverse human populations and usually with many human examples per represented ethnic population. Thus the inventor realised that targeting such rarer forms would provide for effective treatment prophylaxis or diagnosis across many human ethnic populations thereby extending the utility of the present invention. In particular human VEGF A variations are correlated with increased incidence or risk of VEGF A mediated diseases or conditions such as ocular conditions or cancer. Additionally or alternatively VEGF A variations are correlated with improved responses following treatments for ocular conditions. The inventor analysed such variations and devised the collections of variants in Tables 18 20. As shown in those tables the inventor also assessed variation in other human targets that also correlate to incidence or risk of diseases or conditions such as ocular conditions or cancer or improved responses following treatments for ocular conditions. In this respect therefore the invention provides various aspects and concepts as set out below in this example.

The inventor saw that there is significant industrial and medical application for the invention in terms of guiding the choice of anti TOI VEGF A PDGF B and or PDGFR B ligand for administration to human patients for therapy and or prophylaxis of VEGF A PDGF B and or PDGFR B mediated or associated diseases or conditions. In this way the patient receives drugs and ligands that are tailored to their needs as determined by the patient s genetic or phenotypic makeup.

PDGF B is also known as IBGC5 PDGF 2 PDGF2 SIS SSV and c sis. Platelet derived growth factor receptor beta PDGFRB is also known as CD140B IBGC4 IMF1 JTK12 PDGFR 1 and PDGFR1.

PDGF is a growth factor which may play a role in ocular neovascularization and has been documented to be a mitogen for pericytes as well as smooth muscles cells fibroblasts and other mesenchymal cell types. Pericytes appear critical for the maintenance of established blood vessels and may be important in the maturation process in ocular conditions such as choroidal neovascularization. It has been hypothesized that there is a period of VEGF dependency of endothelial cells that overlaps with a period of responsiveness to PDGF withdrawal in newly formed neovascular vessels. Established mature vessels may be associated with resistance to anti VEGF blockade or rapid recurrence of choroidal neovascularization.

PDGF has been demonstrated to stimulate angiogenesis and pericyte recruitment. Loss of pericytes in retinal vessels is thought to be associated with abnormalities of the vasculature and instability including the formation of microaneurysms and vascular permeability. Loss of pericytes with PDGF blockade may be associated with regression of maturing neovascularization. Pericytes produce VEGF A under selected conditions possibly thereby protecting endothelial cells when generalized suppression of VEGF A is present.

Jo et al demonstrated increased suppression of neovascularization in experimental models with specific blockade of both VEGF A and PDGF B as compared with blockade with VEGF A alone. In addition neovascularization became more resistant to VEGF A blockade with progression. Suppression of VEGF A and PDGF B together caused regression of neovascularization not responsive to anti VEGF A alone.

A treatment regimen combining inhibition of pericyte and endothelial cell function through the use of concomitant administration of anti VEGF A targeting and PDGF BB pathway targeting is useful for blocking both paracrine and autocrine VEGF signalling in endothelial cells.

The angiopoietins are ligands for the endothelial cell receptor Tie2 and are essential for vascular development and angiogenesis. Unlike other family members angiopoietin 2 Ang2 is strongly up regulated by endothelial cells at sites of angiogenesis and vascular remodelling including tumours. Enhanced anti tumour effects have been observed in preclinical models with combined blockade of both VEGF and Ang2.

The Ang2 pathway acts to remodel blood vessels and in particular is active during both developmental and pathological angiogenesis. But it is nearly absent from mature quiescent vasculature. Hence a combination Ang2 VEGF blockade results in decreased survival and maturation of neovessels as well as inhibition of pathological leaks. Ang2 inhibition also blocks vascular remodelling driven by inflammation in model systems in which VEGF inhibition is ineffective suggesting that combination blockade has potential for a greater therapeutic benefit.

Endothelial cells ECs in blood vessels under formation are stabilized by the recruitment of pericytes both in normal tissues and during angiogenesis in pathologic situations including cancer. Endothelial cells in small blood vessels and capillaries interact with pericytes cells of mesenchymal origin that provide important support for blood vessel formation and function. Numerous studies describe the significance of members of the platelet derived growth factor PDGF family for recruitment to and productive association of pericytes with the blood vessel endothelium during embryonal development. Strikingly mice lacking components of the PDGF B PDGFR signaling axis are essentially devoid of pericytes and as a consequence die from microhemorrhaging because of malformed blood vessels. Reference is made to Blood. 2011 September 8 118 10 2906 2917 prepublished online 2011 July 21 doi 10.1182 blood 2011 01 331694 Pericytes promote endothelial cell survival through induction of autocrine VEGF A signaling and Bcl w expression Franco M et al. The authors describe that newly formed vascular sprouts recruit pericytes primarily through secretion of platelet derived growth factor beta PDGF BB by endothelial tip cells. Pericytes respond by migrating along the matrix retained gradient of PDGF BB and by a proliferative burst as they reach the tip of the sprout. Reciprocally pericytes up regulate expression of cell bound VEGF A as they mature and are recruited into newly formed vessels. The authors found that pericytes in addition to producing VEGF A that acts in a paracrine fashion stimulate autocrine expression of VEGF A by tumour endothelial cells. The authors suggest that a treatment regimen combining inhibition of pericyte and endothelial cell function through the use of concomitant administration of a VEGF targeting antibody and a PDGF BB PDGFR targeting antibody for blocking both paracrine and autocrine VEGF signalling in ECs.

Human PD L1 is also known as CD274 B7 H B7H1 B7 H1 B7 homolog 1 MGC142294 MGC142296 PDCD1L1 PDCD1LG1 PDCD1 ligand 1 PDL1 Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 and Programmed death ligand 1 and has Uniprot number Q9NZQ7 and NCBI gene ID number 29126. PD L1 is a 290 amino acid type I transmembrane protein encoded by the CD274 gene on human chromosome 9. PD L1 expression is implicated in evasion of immune responses involved in chronic infection e.g. by viruses including for example HIV HBV HCV and HTLV among others by bacteria including for example among others and by parasites including for example . CD274 PD L1 expression is also implicated in suppression of anti tumour immune activity. Tumours express antigens that can be recognized by host T cells but immunologic clearance of tumours is rare. Part of this failure is due to immune suppression by the tumour microenvironment. PD L1 expression on many tumours is a component of this suppressive milieu and may act in concert with other immunosuppressive signals. PD L1 expression has been shown in situ on a wide variety of solid tumours including breast lung colon ovarian melanoma bladder liver salivary stomach gliomas thyroid thymic epithelial head and neck Brown J A et al. 2003. J. Immunol. 170 1257 66 Dong H et al. 2002. Nat. Med. 8 793 800 Hamanishi J et al. 2007. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 104 3360 65 Strome S E et al. 2003. Cancer Res. 63 6501 5 Inman B A et al. 2007. Cancer 109 1499 505 Konishi J et. al.. 2004. Clin. Cancer Res. 10 5094 100 Nakanishi J et. al.. 2007. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 56 1173 82 Nomi T et al. 2007. Clin. Cancer Res. 13 2151 57 Thompson R H et al. 2004. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 101 17174 79 Wu C Zhu Y Jiang J Zhao J Zhang X G Xu N. 2006. Acta Histochem. 108 19 24 . In addition PD 1 expression is upregulated on tumour infiltrating lymphocytes and this may also contribute to tumour immunosuppression Blank C et al. 2003. J. Immunol. 171 4574 81 . In ovarian cancer PD L1 expression is inversely correlated with intraepithelial but not stromal infiltrating CD8 T cells suggesting that PD L1 inhibits the intratumor migration of CD8 T cells Hamanishi J et. al.. 2007. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 104 3360 65 . Translation of PD L1 mRNA is enhanced by loss of PTEN and the ensuing activation of Akt a common event in tumourigenesis Parsa A T et al. 2007. Nat. Med. 13 84 88 . Most importantly studies relating PD L1 expression on tumours to disease outcome show that PD L1 expression strongly correlates with unfavorable prognosis in kidney ovarian bladder breast gastric and pancreatic cancer Hamanishi J et al. 2007. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 104 3360 65 Inman B A et al. 2007. Cancer 109 1499 505 Konishi J et. al.. 2004. Clin. Cancer Res. 10 5094 100 Nakanishi J et. al.. 2007. Cancer Immunol.

Acta Histochem. 108 19 24 . In addition these studies suggest that higher levels of PD L1 expression on tumours may facilitate advancement of tumour stage and invasion into deeper tissue structures.

The PD 1 pathway can also play a role in hematologic malignancies. PD L1 is expressed on multiple myeloma cells but not on normal plasma cells Liu J et al. 2007. Blood 110 296 304 . PD L1 is expressed on some primary T cell lymphomas particularly anaplastic large cell T lymphomas Brown J A et al. 2003. J. Immunol 170 1257 66 . PD 1 is highly expressed on the T cells of angioimmunoblastic lymphomas and PD L1 is expressed on the associated follicular dendritic cell network Dorfman D M et al. 2006. Am. J. Surg. Pathol. 30 802 10 . In nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma the T cells associated with lymphocytic and or histiocytic L H cells express PD 1. Microarray analysis using a readout of genes induced by PD 1 ligation suggests that tumour associated T cells are responding to PD 1 signals in situ in Hodgkin lymphoma Chemnitz J M et al. 2007110 3226 33 . PD 1 and PD L1 are expressed on CD4 T cells in HTLV 1 mediated adult T cell leukemia and lymphoma Shimauchi T et al. 2007121 2585 90 . These tumour cells are hyporesponsive to TCR signals.

Studies in animal models demonstrate that PD L1 on tumours inhibits T cell activation and lysis of tumour cells and in some cases leads to increased tumour specific T cell death Dong H et al. 20028 793 800 Hirano F et al. 200565 1089 96 . Tumour associated APCs can also utilize the PD 1 PD L pathway to control antitumor T cell responses. PD L1 expression on a population of tumour associated myeloid DCs is upregulated by tumour environmental factors Curiel T J et al. 20039 562 67 . Plasmacytoid dendritic cells DCs in the tumour draining lymph node of B 16 melanoma express IDO which strongly activates the suppressive activity of regulatory T cells. The suppressive activity of IDO treated regulatory T cells required cell contact with IDO expressing DCs Sharma M D et al. 2007117 2570 82 .

To evaluate the correlation between a polymorphism of PD L1 gene and the susceptibility of non small cell lung cancer NSCLC in a Chinese population.

A total of 293 Chinese patients with NSCLC and 293 age and sex matched controls of the same ethnic origin were enrolled in this study. A C polymorphism at position 8923 in intron 4 of PD L1 gene was typed using the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism method PCR RFLP . The interactions between A C genotype allele frequency and NSCLC susceptibility were analyzed.

The A C genotype frequencies were significantly different between NSCLC patients and controls. The AC and CC frequencies were higher in NSCLC patients than in controls 16.4 vs 8.9 1.0 vs 0.3 respectively . The C allele frequency was higher in NSCLC patients than in controls 9.2 vs 4.8 . Significant differences in the A and C allele frequencies were noted between the two groups 2 8.864 P 0.003 . More risk of NSCLC was found in individuals carrying the C allele than in those carrying the A allele OR 2.203 95 CI 1.262 3.242 . In both light smokers 20 pack years and heavy smokers 20 pack years individuals carrying the C allele had more risk of NSCLC than those carrying the A allele light smokers OR 1.847 95 CI 1.001 3.409 heavy smokers OR 3.252 95 CI 1.196 8.845 respectively .

An A C polymorphism at position 8923 in the PD L1 gene is associated with NSCLC susceptibility. The PD L1 polymorphism plays a role in NSCLC especially in patients with the C allele.

Programmed cell death 1 PD 1 and its ligands PD L1 and PD L2 inhibit T cell proliferation and activation. This inhibition down regulates the immune responses. The association of a PD L1 polymorphism with Graves disease GD was studied.

The study included 327 GD patients and 192 controls of which 252 GD patients were followed over 5 10 years.

PD L1 intron 4 position 8923 A C polymorphism was typed using the PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism method.

The A C genotype frequencies were significantly different between GD patients and controls. The A C and C C frequencies were higher in GD patients than in controls. The A A frequencies were lower in GD patients than in controls. C allele frequency was higher in GD patients than in controls. A total of 252 GD patients were followed over 5 10 years 200 had discontinued antithyroid drugs ATD while 52 continued to take ATD. Of these 200 176 continued to be in remission and 24 had relapsed into hyperthyroidism. Significant differences in the duration of positive TBII positive thyroid stimulating antibodies and ATD treatment were noted between the patients in remission and those that had relapsed. Significant differences in the A and C allele frequencies were noted between the two. The C allele frequency was higher in GD patients who did not achieve remission than in those who achieved remission.

An A C polymorphism at position 8923 in PD L1 is associated with GD. The PD L1 polymorphism plays a role in GD development. GD patients with the C allele at position 8923 in PD L1 gene had difficulty in achieving remission.

Human subjects with the PD 1 GG genotype had significantly greater risk for ankylosing spondylitis AS than those with the AA genotype. Subjects with the PD L2 CT genotype had lower risk for AS than those with the CC genotype. The combined genotypes of PD 1 G 536A PD L1 A8923C and PD L2 C47103T also appear to be associated with AS development.

The results suggest that PD 1 G 536A PD L1 A8923C and PD L2 C47103T polymorphisms are associated with the presence of AS.

Despite much investigation a substantial amount of the genetic susceptibility to autoimmune diseases remains unaccounted for. Recently a single nucleotide polymorphism SNP in the programmed death ligand 1 PD L1 gene has been associated with Graves disease GD in a Japanese patient cohort. Our aim was to determine whether variants in PD L1 are also associated with autoimmune Addison s disease AAD and to replicate the previous association in patients with GD from the United Kingdom.

We analyzed eight SNPs within PD L1 in a United Kingdom cohort of 315 AAD subjects and 316 healthy controls. We then replicated our experiment in a cohort of 342 Norwegian AAD cases and 379 controls and in 496 United Kingdom GD subjects.

Three of the eight SNPs studied part of a haplotype block in the PD L1 gene showed modest association with both AAD and GD in the United Kingdom cohort with maximum evidence at the marker RS1411262 United Kingdom AAD odds ratio 1.33 5 95 confidence interval 1.02 1.73 P genotype 0.028 GD odds ratio 1.36 5 95 confidence interval 1.07 1.72 P genotype 0.033 . Association with genotypes at the same three markers was confirmed in the Norwegian AAD cohort P genotype 0.011 0.020 . A recessive effect at the most associated alleles was observed in both the AAD and GD cohorts.

We confirm the role of PD L1 variants in GD susceptibility and extend these findings to demonstrate association in two Northern European patient cohorts with AAD. PD L1 joins the growing number of known susceptibility loci exerting modest effects in these autoimmune disorders.

To investigate the role of ligands for programmed cell death 1 PD L in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis RA 129 patients with RA and 125 unrelated healthy controls were enrolled in this study. The PD L1 and PD L2 polymorphisms were determined by the method of polymerase chain reaction PCR direct sequencing or PCR reaction fragment length polymorphisms. The genotype distributions of PD L1 6777 C G were not significantly different between the patients with RA and healthy controls. There was also no significant difference in the allele frequencies of PD L1 6777 C G polymorphisms between the patients with RA and controls. Similar findings could also be found in the phenotypes and alleles frequencies of PD L2 47103 C T and 47139 T C polymorphisms between the patients with RA and controls. The patients with PD L1 6777 G had higher prevalence of rheumatoid nodule in comparison with those without PD L1 6777 G p 0.005 OR 4.0 95 CI 1.5 10.9 . In contrast the PD L2 47103 C T and 47139 T C polymorphisms were not related to the occurrence of rheumatoid nodule. This study demonstrated that the PD L1 and PD L2 polymorphisms were not associated with susceptibility to RA in Taiwan. PD L1 6777 G was associated with the prevalence of rheumatoid nodule.

Since the over expression of B7 H1 protein has been reported to be closely related to disease progression of gastric cancer the authors investigated the possible role of miRSNPs at the 3 untranslated region 3 UTR of B7 H1 in the risk of developing gastric cancer. In this association study on 205 gastric adenocarcinoma patients and 393 non cancer controls they found that the genotype distribution of a common C G polymorphism rs4143815 was significantly different between the cases and controls P 1.32 10 8 . Compared with CC homozygotes GG homozygotes and G allele carriers showed 3.73 fold P 2.98 10 8 and 1.85 fold P 0.002 increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma respectively. Stratified analyses indicated that variant genotypes had a strong association with the clinic pathological features of gastric cancer including differentiation grade depth of tumor infiltration and tumor node metastasis TNM stage P

The aberrant expression of programmed cell death 1 ligands 1 and 2 PD Ls on tumor cells dampens antitumor immunity resulting in tumor immune evasion. In this study we investigated the expression of PD Ls in human hepatocellular carcinoma HCC to define their prognostic significance after curative surgery.

Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate PD Ls expression as well as granzyme B cytotoxic and FoxP3 regulatory T cell infiltration on tissue microarrays containing 240 randomly selected HCC patients who underwent surgery. The results were further verified in an independent cohort of 125 HCC patients. PD Ls expression on HCC cell lines was detected by Western blot assay.

Patients with higher expression of PD L1 had a significantly poorer prognosis than patients with lower expression. Although patients with higher expression of PD L2 also had a poorer survival the difference in recurrence was not statistically significant. Multivariate analysis identified tumor expression of PD L1 as an independent predictor for postoperative recurrence. No correlation was found between PD Ls expression and granzyme B lymphocyte infiltration whereas a significant positive correlation was detected between PD Ls expression and FoxP3 lymphocyte infiltration. In addition tumor infiltrating cytotoxic and regulatory T cells were also independent prognosticators for both survival and recurrence. The prognostic value of PD L1 expression was validated in the independent data set.

Our data suggest for the first time that PD L1 status may be a new predictor of recurrence for HCC patients and provide the rationale for developing a novel therapy of targeting the PD L1 PD 1 pathway against this fatal malignancy.

Using this analysis the inventor has devised the following aspects of the invention that are useful for addressing PD L1 mediated diseases and conditions such as cancer autoimmune or inflammatory diseases and conditions as more fully described below. Thus the invention provides the following aspects.

In an example the invention provides a method of treating or reducing the risk of a PD L1 mediated disease or condition in a human in need thereof the method comprising administering to said human a ligand eg an antibody or antibody fragment that specifically binds a human PD L1 protein. The invention also provides a corresponding ligand. In an embodiment the PD L1 is encoded by a PD L1 nucleotide sequence comprising a variation set out in Table 21 eg comprising one or more of said SNPs eg RS1411262 and or rs4143815 or 8923C and or 395C . In a preferred embodiment the variation is 8923C.

The present invention provides anti PD L1 ligands and PD L1 binding or targeting ligands as described herein. The ligands have a variety of utilities. Some of the ligands for instance are useful in specific binding assays for genotyping or phenotyping humans affinity purification of PD L1 in particular human PD L1 or its ligands and in screening assays to identify other antagonists of PD L1 activity. Some of the ligands of the invention are useful for inhibiting PD L1 mediated activities.

Anti PD L1 ligands eg antibodies and anti sense RNA have been developed based on targeting and neutralising so called wild type human PD L1 which is a commonly occurring form. While such therapies are useful for human patients harbouring this form of human PD L1 the inventor considered it useful to investigate the possibility of targeting rarer but still naturally occurring forms of PD L1 amongst human populations. In this way the inventor arrived at insight into the natural occurrences and distributions of rarer human PD L1 forms that can serve as useful targets at the protein or nucleic acid level for human treatment prophylaxis and diagnosis pertinent to diseases and conditions mediated or associated with PD L1 activity. This particularly provides for tailored therapies prophylaxis and diagnosis in humans that are devoid of the common PD L1 gene or protein.

The skilled person will know that SNPs or other changes that translate into amino acid variation can cause variability in activity and or conformation of human targets to be addressed. This has spawned great interest in personalized medicine where genotyping and knowledge of protein and nucleotide variability is used to more effectively tailor medicines and diagnosis of patients. The invention therefore provides for tailored pharmaceuticals and testing that specifically addresses rarer PD L1 polymorphic variant forms. Such forms or alleles at the nucleotide level comprise one or more changes at the nucleotide and amino acid levels from the corresponding common form nucleotide and amino acids sequences ie there are one or more non synonymous aka missense changes at the nucleotide level that translate into one or more corresponding changes in the protein target in humans.

Furthermore the inventor surprisingly realised that the rarer natural forms although present in humans at much lower frequencies than the common form nevertheless are represented in multiple and ethnically diverse human populations and usually with many human examples per represented ethnic population. Thus the inventor realised that targeting such rarer forms would provide for effective treatment prophylaxis or diagnosis across many human ethnic populations thereby extending the utility of the present invention. In particular human PD L1 variations are correlated with increased incidence or risk of PD L1 mediated diseases or conditions such as cancer. The inventor analysed such variations and devised the collections of variants in Table 21. In this respect therefore the invention provides various aspects and aspects as set out below in this example.

The inventor saw that there is significant industrial and medical application for the invention in terms of guiding the choice of anti TOI PD L1 ligand for administration to human patients for therapy and or prophylaxis of PD L1 mediated or associated diseases or conditions. In this way the patient receives drugs and ligands that are tailored to their needs as determined by the patient s genetic or phenotypic makeup. Hand in hand with this the invention provides for the genotyping and or phenotyping of patients in connection with such treatment thereby allowing a proper match of drug to patient. This increases the chances of medical efficacy reduces the likelihood of inferior treatment using drugs or ligands that are not matched to the patient eg poor efficacy and or side effects and avoids pharmaceutical mis prescription and waste.

In developing this thinking in a non limiting embodiment the present inventor decided to determine a set of human PD L1 variants on the basis of the following criteria these being criteria that the inventor realised would provide for useful medical drugs and diagnostics to tailored need in the human population. In an embodiment the inventor selected variants having at least 3 of the 4 following criteria 

In an example the ligand of the invention comprises an anti human PD L1 binding site wherein the binding site is a human or humanized binding site eg the binding site comprises or consists of a human or humanized antibody variable domain or plurality of variable domains eg human VH VL binding site s . Additionally or alternatively the ligand comprises one or more human antibody constant regions eg a human antibody CH1 CH2 CH3 or all of these or Fc . In an example the ligand is an antibody that comprises human or humanized variable regions and human constant regions eg bearing one or more mutations to enhance or dampen Fc function in a human patient .

In an example the invention provides a method of targeting PD L1 in a human the method comprising administering to said human a ligand eg an antibody or antibody fragment that specifically binds a human PD L1 protein that is encoded by a human PD L1 nucleotide comprising a PD L1 variation as described herein. In an example the human is suffering from or at risk of a PD L1 mediated disease or condition.
