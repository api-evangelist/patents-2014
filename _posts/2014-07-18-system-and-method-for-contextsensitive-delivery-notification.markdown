Embodiments disclosed herein relate generally to location based communication and data gathering and specifically to the use of mailbox mounted devices as a basis for communication and data gathering.

While electronic communication has radically changed the way information can be exchanged it has not eliminated the need for the physical delivery of parcels. Physical goods of course cannot be sent as digital information and must still be delivered in a more or less conventional manner. Some formal documents must also be delivered rather than sent electronically. Electronic communication has been used to help make the delivery process simpler for the user by means of parcel tracking applications and some mailboxes can alert the user to the receipt of delivered goods. However these devices still do not account adequately for the particular circumstances of the user such as the user s location at the time of the delivery or special concerns that the user may have regarding a particular delivery or at a particular time.

There is thus a need for a system that alerts users to the delivery of parcels in a context sensitive manner.

A method is disclosed for context sensitive delivery notification. In one embodiment the method involves determining by a computing device an anticipated delivery time receiving by the computing device from a first delivery sensing depository an indication that the first delivery sensing depository has received a delivery at a time differing from the anticipated delivery time and alerting by the computing device a user regarding the detected delivery.

In a related embodiment determining further includes receiving by the computing device a delivery schedule and calculating by the computing device using the delivery schedule the anticipated delivery time. In another embodiment determining involve maintaining in memory accessible to the computing device the times of past deliveries detected by the first delivery sensing depository and calculating using the times of past deliveries a probable future delivery time. In an additional embodiment determining involves receiving from a second delivery sensing depository an indication that a delivery has occurred at the second delivery sensing depository calculating by the computing device a probable route of a postal carrier making the delivery at the second delivery sensing depository and predicting using the calculated probable route a delivery at the first delivery sensing depository. In still another embodiment determining further includes receiving from a user an instruction specifying the anticipated delivery time.

A related embodiment also involves capturing by the first delivery sensing depository using a sensor coupled to the first delivery sensing depository data concerning a postal carrier performing the detected delivery. Another embodiment involves receiving by the computing device at least one instruction describing a feature of a postal carrier associated with a dangerous parcel determining by the computing device that the captured data matches the feature and alerting by the computing device the user that the parcel may be dangerous. An additional embodiment involves capturing by the first delivery sensing depository using a sensor coupled to the first delivery sensing depository data concerning a delivery vehicle performing the detected delivery. Another embodiment involves receiving by the computing device at least one instruction describing a feature of a delivery vehicle associated with a dangerous parcel determining by the computing device that the captured data matches the feature and alerting by the computing device the user that the parcel may be dangerous.

Another embodiment involves capturing by the first delivery sensing depository data regarding a delivered parcel and alerting by the computing device the user responsively to the captured data. In a further embodiment involves capturing also includes capturing using a camera coupled to the first delivery sensing depository an image of the parcel. In an additional embodiment capturing further includes determining using a scale coupled to the first delivery sensing depository the mass of the parcel. In still another embodiment capturing further involves scanning using a code scanner coupled to the first delivery sensing depository a code attached to the parcel. In another embodiment alerting the user responsively to the captured data further comprises providing the captured data to the user. In another embodiment alerting the user further includes receiving by the computing device at least one instruction describing a feature associated with a dangerous parcel determining by the computing device that the captured data matches the feature and alerting by the computing device the user that the parcel may be dangerous. In still another embodiment alerting the user also involves receiving by the computing device at least one instruction describing a set of features associated with safe parcels determining by the computing device that the captured data does not match any feature of the set of features and alerting by the computing device the user that the parcel may be dangerous. The set of features is a set of codes and determining further comprises scanning a code attached to the parcel and comparing the scanned code to each code in the set of codes in an additional embodiment.

Other aspects embodiments and features of the system and method will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying figures. The accompanying figures are for schematic purposes and are not intended to be drawn to scale. In the figures each identical or substantially similar component that is illustrated in various figures is represented by a single numeral or notation. For purposes of clarity not every component is labeled in every figure. Nor is every component of each embodiment of the system and method shown where illustration is not necessary to allow those of ordinary skill in the art to understand the system and method.

Some embodiments of the disclosed system and methods will be better understood by reference to the following comments concerning computing devices. A computing device may be defined as including personal computers laptops tablets smart phones and any other computing device capable of supporting an application as described herein. The system and method disclosed herein will be better understood in light of the following observations concerning the computing devices that support the disclosed application and concerning the nature of web applications in general. An exemplary computing device is illustrated by . The processor may be a special purpose or a general purpose processor device. As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the relevant art the processor device may also be a single processor in a multi core multiprocessor system such system operating alone or in a cluster of computing devices operating in a cluster or server farm. The processor is connected to a communication infrastructure for example a bus message queue network or multi core message passing scheme.

The computing device also includes a main memory such as random access memory RAM and may also include a secondary memory . Secondary memory may include for example a hard disk drive a removable storage drive or interface connected to a removable storage unit or other similar means. As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the relevant art a removable storage unit includes a computer usable storage medium having stored therein computer software and or data. Examples of additional means creating secondary memory may include a program cartridge and cartridge interface such as that found in video game devices a removable memory chip such as an EPROM or PROM and associated socket and other removable storage units and interfaces which allow software and data to be transferred from the removable storage unit to the computer system. In some embodiments to maintain data in the memory of a computing device means to store that data in that memory in a form convenient for retrieval as required by the algorithm at issue and to retrieve update or delete the data as needed.

The computing device may also include a communications interface . The communications interface allows software and data to be transferred between the computing device and external devices. The communications interface may include a modem a network interface such as an Ethernet card a communications port a PCMCIA slot and card or other means to couple the computing device to external devices. Software and data transferred via the communications interface may be in the form of signals which may be electronic electromagnetic optical or other signals capable of being received by the communications interface . These signals may be provided to the communications interface via wire or cable fiber optics a phone line a cellular phone link and radio frequency link or other communications channels. Other devices may be coupled to the computing device via the communications interface . In some embodiments a device or component is coupled to a computing device if it is so related to that device that the product or means and the device may be operated together as one machine. In particular a piece of electronic equipment is coupled to a computing device if it is incorporated in the computing device e.g. a built in camera on a smart phone attached to the device by wires capable of propagating signals between the equipment and the device e.g. a mouse connected to a personal computer by means of a wire plugged into one of the computer s ports tethered to the device by wireless technology that replaces the ability of wires to propagate signals e.g. a wireless BLUETOOTH headset for a mobile phone or related to the computing device by shared membership in some network consisting of wireless and wired connections between multiple machines e.g. a printer in an office that prints documents to computers belonging to that office no matter where they are so long as they and the printer can connect to the internet . A computing device may be coupled to a second computing device not shown for instance a server may be coupled to a client device as described below in greater detail.

The communications interface in the system embodiments discussed herein facilitates the coupling of the computing device with data entry devices the device s display and network connections whether wired or wireless . In some embodiments data entry devices are any equipment coupled to a computing device that may be used to enter data into that device. This definition includes without limitation keyboards computer mice touchscreens digital cameras digital video cameras wireless antennas Global Positioning System devices audio input and output devices gyroscopic orientation sensors proximity sensors compasses scanners specialized reading devices such as fingerprint or retinal scanners and any hardware device capable of sensing electromagnetic radiation electromagnetic fields gravitational force electromagnetic force temperature vibration or pressure. A computing device s manual data entry devices is the set of all data entry devices coupled to the computing device that permit the user to enter data into the computing device using manual manipulation. Manual entry devices include without limitation keyboards keypads touchscreens track pads computer mice buttons and other similar components. A computing device may also possess a navigation facility. The computing device s navigation facility may be any facility coupled to the computing device that enables the device accurately to calculate the device s location on the surface of the Earth. Navigation facilities can include a receiver configured to communicate with the Global Positioning System or with similar satellite networks as well as any other system that mobile phones or other devices use to ascertain their location for example by communicating with cell towers. A code scanner coupled to a computing device is a device that can extract information from a code attached to an object. In one embodiment a code contains data concerning the object to which it is attached that may be extracted automatically by a scanner for instance a code may be a bar code whose data may be extracted using a laser scanner. A code may include a quick read QR code whose data may be extracted by a digital scanner or camera. A code may include a radio frequency identification RFID tag.

In some embodiments a computing device s display is a device coupled to the computing device by means of which the computing device can display images. Display include without limitation monitors screens television devices and projectors.

Computer programs also called computer control logic are stored in main memory and or secondary memory . Computer programs may also be received via the communications interface . Such computer programs when executed enable the processor device to implement the system embodiments discussed below. Accordingly such computer programs represent controllers of the system. Where embodiments are implemented using software the software may be stored in a computer program product and loaded into the computing device using a removable storage drive or interface a hard disk drive or a communications interface .

The computing device may also store data in database accessible to the device. A database is any structured collection of data. As used herein databases can include NoSQL data stores which store data in a few key value structures such as arrays for rapid retrieval using a known set of keys e.g. array indices . Another possibility is a relational database which can divide the data stored into fields representing useful categories of data. As a result a stored data record can be quickly retrieved using any known portion of the data that has been stored in that record by searching within that known datum s category within the database and can be accessed by more complex queries using languages such as Structured Query Language which retrieve data based on limiting values passed as parameters and relationships between the data being retrieved. More specialized queries such as image matching queries may also be used to search some databases. A database can be created in any digital memory.

Persons skilled in the relevant art will also be aware that while any computing device must necessarily include facilities to perform the functions of a processor a communication infrastructure at least a main memory and usually a communications interface not all devices will necessarily house these facilities separately. For instance in some forms of computing devices as defined above processing and memory could be distributed through the same hardware device as in a neural net and thus the communications infrastructure could be a property of the configuration of that particular hardware device. Many devices do practice a physical division of tasks as set forth above however and practitioners skilled in the art will understand the conceptual separation of tasks as applicable even where physical components are merged.

The systems may be deployed in a number of ways including on a stand alone computing device a set of computing devices working together in a network or a web application. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize a web application as a particular kind of computer program system designed to function across a network such as the Internet. A schematic illustration of a web application platform is provided in . Web application platforms typically include at least one client device which is an computing device as described above. The client device connects via some form of network connection to a network such as the Internet. The network may be any arrangement that links together computing devices and includes without limitation local and international wired networks including telephone cable and fiber optic networks wireless networks that exchange information using signals of electromagnetic radiation including cellular communication and data networks and any combination of those wired and wireless networks. Also connected to the network is at least one server which is also an computing device as described above or a set of computing devices that communicate with each other and work in concert by local or network connections. Of course practitioners of ordinary skill in the relevant art will recognize that a web application can and typically does run on several servers and a vast and continuously changing population of client devices . Computer programs on both the client device and the server configure both devices to perform the functions required of the web application . Web applications can be designed so that the bulk of their processing tasks are accomplished by the server as configured to perform those tasks by its web application program or alternatively by the client device . Some web applications are designed so that the client device solely displays content that is sent to it by the server and the server performs all of the processing business logic and data storage tasks. Such thin client web applications are sometimes referred to as cloud applications because essentially all computing tasks are performed by a set of servers and data centers visible to the client only as a single opaque entity often represented on diagrams as a cloud.

Many computing devices as defined herein come equipped with a specialized program known as a web browser which enables them to act as a client device at least for the purposes of receiving and displaying data output by the server without any additional programming. Web browsers can also act as a platform to run so much of a web application as is being performed by the client device and it is a common practice to write the portion of a web application calculated to run on the client device to be operated entirely by a web browser. Such browser executed programs are referred to herein as client side programs and frequently are loaded onto the browser from the server at the same time as the other content the server sends to the browser. However it is also possible to write programs that do not run on web browsers but still cause an computing device to operate as a web application client . Thus as a general matter web applications require some computer program configuration of both the client device or devices and the server . The computer program that comprises the web application component on either computing device s system configures that device s processor to perform the portion of the overall web application s functions that the programmer chooses to assign to that device. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the programming tasks assigned to one device may overlap with those assigned to another in the interests of robustness flexibility or performance. Furthermore although the best known example of a web application as used herein uses the kind of hypertext markup language protocol popularized by the World Wide Web practitioners of ordinary skill in the art will be aware of other network communication protocols such as File Transfer Protocol that also support web applications as defined herein.

The system includes at least one user interfacing device . The at least one user interfacing device may be integrated in the delivery sensing depository for instance the at least one delivery sensing depository may be one of the at least one user interfacing device because it incorporates such elements as a display and data entry devices as described above in reference to . The at least one user interfacing device may be a separate device from the delivery sensing depository . The at least one user interfacing device may be a computing device as disclosed above in reference to for instance the at least one user interfacing device may be a mobile device such as a mobile phone tablet laptop or netbook. The at least one user interfacing device may be a special purpose control system coupled to the delivery sensing depository. As an example the at least one user interfacing device may be incorporated in a dwelling or place of business corresponding to the delivery sensing depository .

The user interfacing device may include one or more signaling devices . In an embodiment a signaling device is a device by means of which a user interfacing device can convey an intelligible signal indicating a detected delivery status to a user as set forth in further detail below. The at least one signaling device may include any device described above for conveying information to a user in reference to . The at least one signaling device may include a display such as a display as described above in reference to . The at least one signaling device may include one or more lights. The one or more lights may be any light source described above in reference to . In some embodiments the user interfacing device uses household appliances coupled to the user interfacing device as a signaling device for instance the house lights in one embodiment may be connected to a controller capable of interfacing with a computing device as described above in reference to and the user interfacing device may cause the house lights to blink on and off in a certain pattern to indicated a detected delivery status in much the same way that a theater blinks lights on and off to signal the imminent commencement of an act. Likewise the user interfacing device may use an alarm system such as a burglar or fire alarm system to signal the user the alarm system may be capable of emitting a signal that is unlikely to be confused for a signal indicating an emergency. In another embodiment the at least one signaling device includes a noise emitting device such as a speaker or a buzzer.

The user interfacing device may include other indicators such as an RSSI strength indicator a wi fi strength indicator or one or more error indicators to inform the user that a connection to the delivery sensing depository or to a network has failed.

In some embodiments the at least one user interfacing device is near to the user. In one embodiment the at least one user interfacing device is near to the user if it is sufficiently close to the user to enable it to signal the user by means of devices coupled to the user interface device . For instance if the at least one user interfacing device is a phone within earshot of the user such that the user could hear the phone emit a signal such as a ringtone the user interface may be near the user.

The power source may be capable of accepting different kinds of batteries in the same battery pack. Thus for example if there is a power failure for an embodiment in which rechargeable batteries are recharged from the power grid the user may be able to insert one or more alkaline batteries in place of the rechargeable batteries. To prevent the recharging circuit from discharging the newly inserted alkaline batteries or recharging them inappropriately causing leaks the processor may be configured to switch on the battery charging circuit only when the voltage falls below a certain threshold such as 2.6 volts. The processor may be configured to detect that the batteries in the battery pack are alkaline batteries rather than rechargeable batteries when the voltage falls below the threshold by beginning the recharging process and monitoring the recharging curve the voltage on an alkaline battery quickly regains it initial value during recharging whereas the voltage on many rechargeable batteries recovers more slowly so the processor may be programmed to deactivate the charging circuit upon detecting a rapid initial rise in voltage. The processor may be further configured to signal to a user that battery replacement is needed using any means disclosed herein for communication with users.

The at least one user interfacing device may detect that a user is near because the user is interacting with a device. For instance the user may interacting with the user interfacing device as an example if the at least one user interfacing device is a computing device as disclosed above in reference to the user may engage one or more data entry devices to log on to the device to perform communication via the at least one user interfacing device with another user or device or for any other purpose to which a user might put a computing device. In some embodiments a home appliance may be adapted to communicate to the at least one user interfacing device that it is being used by the user for instance house lights that may be controlled by a remote device via a communication channel may also signal to the at least one user interfacing device via the same communication channel that a user has switched them on or off. Likewise a utility meter such as a water or sewage meter that is equipped to signal its current reading may signal a modified reading to the at least one user interfacing device indicating the presence of a user that is making use of the corresponding utility for instance a change in water meter reading may indicate that the user has turned on a faucet or started up a dishwasher. A particular pattern of usage by a user of a device might indicate that the user is likely still near to the device for instance where the user has switched the house lights on and has not switched them off the at least one user interfacing device may determine that the user is probably still in the room floor or edifice in which the user switched the lights on.

In some embodiments the at least one user interfacing device is configured to identify the detected user. For instance where the user is interfacing directly with the at least one user interfacing device the user may be doing so via one or more user accounts relating to that user.
