This application is a non provisional of and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62 005 897 filed on May 30 2014 the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

Many electronic devices have location based functions. For example a mobile device can estimate a location of the mobile device using a satellite navigation system e.g. global positioning system or GPS or a cellular communications system. The mobile device can perform various tasks that are location specific. For example a map application executing on the mobile device can cause the mobile device to display a map. A marker on the map can indicate a current location of the mobile device. Upon receiving a user input selecting the marker the mobile device can display points of interests e.g. restaurants or gas stations that are close to the current location. Upon receiving a user input specifying a destination the mobile device can display a route from the current location to the destination and an estimated time of arrival based on traffic information on the route.

Techniques for determining a location significant to a user for providing location based services are described. A significant user location is a geographic location that is determined to have a significant meaning to a user of a mobile device such that the user is likely to visit the location in the future. The mobile device can determine that a geographic location is a significant user location based on how long the user has dwelled at the geographic location. The length of time for determining a significant location can be hint based. A hint can be a historical or present action performed on the mobile device or detected by the mobile device that indicates that the user may have an interest at the location. Upon detecting a hint the mobile device can reduce a pre specified threshold time for determining a significant location.

Techniques for adaptive location clustering are described. A mobile device can determine a size of a location cluster indicating a location that is significant to a user. For a pre specified period of time the mobile device can record locations and determine a convergence rate of the recorded location. The convergence rate can indicate how quickly the locations are clustered together. A higher convergence rate corresponds to a smaller size. The mobile device can measure a deviation over a given convergence rate. The mobile device can store the location cluster in association with the size. The mobile device can determine a significant location based on locations in the location cluster and a size of the location cluster.

Techniques for determining a location of a calendar item are described. A mobile device can receive a calendar item including a description and a time. The mobile device can determine that at the time specified in the calendar item the mobile device is located at a location that is estimated to be significant to a user. The mobile device can store the description in association with the significant location. Upon receiving a new calendar item containing at least one term in the description the mobile device can predict that the user will visit the significant location at the time specified in the new calendar item. The mobile device can provide user assistance based on the prediction.

Techniques for determining a location of a mobile device using a location application programming interface API are described. A mobile device can receive an input requesting the mobile device to monitor entry into and exit from a significant location. The mobile device can call a start monitoring instance function of an object of a location manager class as declared in the API to start monitoring and call a stop monitoring instance function of the object as declared in the API to stop monitoring. The mobile device can store the entry and exit or provide a record of the entry or exit to a function that is conformant to the API for performing various tasks.

The features described in this specification can be implemented to achieve one or more advantages. A mobile device can learn a movement pattern of the mobile device and adapt itself to that movement pattern. The mobile device can provide predictive user assistance based on the movement pattern without requiring additional user input including for example alerting the user of traffic conditions while the user is en route to a significant location if the mobile device determines based on past movement patterns of the mobile device that a user will visit the significant location even when the mobile device did not receive a user inquiry. Accordingly a user of the mobile device may have a better experience using services especially location based services of the mobile device. For example the mobile device can determine that a user usually goes from home to work at 8 00 am on weekdays and from home to a gymnasium at 8 00 am on weekends. Upon being turned on shortly before 8 00 am on weekdays the mobile device can automatically display traffic information on a route from home to work whereas on weekends the mobile device can automatically display traffic information on a route from home to the gymnasium.

The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features aspects and advantages of subject matter will become apparent from the description the drawings and the claims.

Mobile device can use machine learning and data mining techniques to learn the past movement of mobile device . The past movement can be recorded as significant locations visited by mobile device and movement of mobile device between the significant locations. Mobile device can determine that a place or region is a significant location upon determining that with sufficient certainty mobile device has stayed at the place or region for a sufficient amount of time. The amount of time can be sufficient if it satisfies various criteria for example when the amount of time satisfies a time length threshold e.g. X hours or a frequency threshold e.g. X minutes per day Y number of days per week . Records of movement of mobile device can include a measured or calculated time of entry into each significant location and a measured or calculated time of exit from each significant location. A significant location can be associated with multiple entries and exits.

In addition to significant locations the records of movement can include transitions between the significant locations. Each transition from a first significant location to a second significant location can be associated with a transition begin timestamp indicating a time mobile device leaves the first significant location and a transition end timestamp indicating a time mobile device enters the second significant location.

Mobile device can represent the records of movement as state model . State model can include states e.g. state and other states each representing a significant location and transitions e.g. transition and other transition between the states each representing a movement of mobile device between significant locations. Additional details of determining state model are described below in reference to .

Based on state model mobile device can determine 1 a transition probability density that at a given time mobile device moves from a given significant location to each other significant location or 2 an entry probability density that mobile device enters a significant location from a previously unknown or unrepresented location. A pattern analyzer of mobile device can determine a daily weekly monthly or annual movement pattern of mobile device using state model . A predictive engine of mobile device can use transition probability density or entry probability density and the movement pattern to forecast a significant location that mobile device will enter or stay at a future time. Mobile device can then use the forecast to provide predictive user assistance e.g. to assist the user to plan for a future event.

In the example of mobile device can determine current location using a location determination subsystem of mobile device . Mobile device can determine current time . Based on the current location current time and the probabilities and patterns of state model mobile device can determine that a most likely location of mobile device at a given time in the future is a significant location represented by state . Mobile device can then perform a user assistance function corresponding to the significant location or corresponding to a transition from the current location to the significant location. For example upon being turned on or unlocked mobile device can provide for display alert on a display surface of mobile device . Alert can include user assistance information . User assistance information can include for example a route from the current location to the likely future location and traffic information along the route. Mobile device can provide for display alert and user assistance information automatically without requesting a user to input the likely future location as a destination.

In some implementations mobile device can provide a label associated with the likely future location. The label can be an address or a name of a point of interest pre specified by a user or determined by mobile device through reverse geocoding or through semantic analysis of movements of mobile device . For example mobile device can determine that a first location is likely to be a home and a second location is likely to be a work place. Accordingly mobile device can use the terms home and work in user assistance information .

Mobile device can sequentially trace location data through time T . Sequentially tracing location data can be performed by piggybacking on another application to avoid or reduce cost of location data collection. For example mobile device can collect the location data when another service requests location from a location determination subsystem of mobile device . Accordingly collecting the location data can be free without having to activate the location determination subsystem solely for determining a movement pattern of mobile device .

Mobile device can collect locations and over time T. Collecting the locations can be on going operations. Locations older than a specified period can be purged. The period can be specified by user preference or privacy policies. Locations and can each include latitude longitude and altitude coordinates and being associated with a timestamp indicating a time the corresponding location is collected.

Mobile device can determine that some of locations and belong to location clusters that may indicate a significant location. Mobile device can determine that a location cluster is formed upon determining that 1 at least a pre specified threshold number e.g. two of consecutive locations are collected 2 a time span of the consecutive locations satisfies a pre specified threshold time window and 3 these locations are identical indicating that mobile device is stationary or sufficiently close to one another indicating that mobile device is located in a sufficiently small and defined area during the time the locations are collected.

For example mobile device can determine two location clusters location cluster and location cluster over time T. Location cluster can include locations and which are collected over a time period T T that is longer than a threshold time window e.g. a time window of 45 minutes . Mobile device can determine that location cluster includes locations and upon determining that a variance of locations and is low enough to satisfy a variance threshold. Likewise location cluster can include locations and which are collected within time period T T . Mobile device can determine that location cluster includes locations and upon determining that a variance of locations and satisfies the variance threshold.

An outlier detection mechanism can filter out locations that do not belong to clusters. For example mobile device can determine that location is different from location and location e.g. the distance between location and and the distance between location and location exceeds a threshold . In addition mobile device can determine that no other locations are 1 collected within the threshold time window before or after location and 2 geographically close to location . In response mobile device can determine that location is an outlier and discard location . In addition if a location in a time period is significantly different from many other locations in the time period mobile device can discard the different location as an outlier and determine the location cluster using other locations in the time window. Mobile device can use location clusters and to determine significant locations and states of state model .

At various times mobile device can be located at locations and . Locations and can be far apart from one another indicating that mobile device is moving. Mobile device can be located at locations through during a continuous period of time. Locations through can be identical or sufficiently close to one another. Mobile device can determine whether the period of time is sufficiently long such that locations through form a location cluster that indicates a significant location based on whether the period of time satisfies a variable threshold. Mobile device can use various hints to determine the variable threshold.

For example mobile device can search locations where mobile device visited previously. Mobile device can designate as a first hint a record indicating that mobile device previously visited the location at or near locations through as a first hint. Mobile device can examine a user search history performed on or through mobile device . If the user searched for the location before mobile device can designate a search query including an address at or near locations through or a business located at or near locations through as a second hint. Mobile device can designate a calendar item in a user calendar e.g. an appointment or a meeting located at or near locations through as a third hint.

Upon detecting one or more hints mobile device can use a shorter time period e.g. five minutes as a threshold for determining a location cluster or significant location. More hints can correspond to shorter threshold. Accordingly mobile device can determine a significant location upon detecting location of the mobile device when the short time threshold is satisfied.

If no hint is found mobile device can use a longer time period e.g. 20 minutes as a threshold for determining a location cluster or significant location. Accordingly when no hint is found mobile device can determine a location cluster or significant location upon detecting location of mobile device when the long time threshold is satisfied. In either case with or without a hint mobile device can determine a significant location in real time e.g. 5 minutes or 20 minutes after locations converge into a cluster.

Mobile device can determine each of significant locations and based on location clusters and using the locations in each of location clusters and . Determining significant locations and can be based on recursive filter with a constant gain. Details of determining significant locations and are provided below in the next paragraph. Each of significant locations and can include latitude longitude and optionally altitude coordinates. Each of significant locations and can be associated with one or more location clusters. For example significant location can correspond to location cluster in time period T T and location cluster during time period T T . Location in location cluster and location cluster can be identical. The length of time period T T and time window T T can be same or different.

Mobile device can have an initial state model at time T. At time T k mobile device can receive incremental location data where k is a difference between time T and the time the additional location data are received in this example k T T . Mobile device can use the incremental location data to determine significant location for use in the state model. Mobile device can determine that location cluster corresponds to latitude and longitude coordinates X. Mobile device can determine that location cluster corresponds to latitude and longitude coordinates X. Mobile device can determine that a distance between X and X satisfies a threshold. In response mobile device can determine that location cluster and location cluster belong to a same location significant location . Mobile device can then add location cluster to significant location using constant gain filter as shown below in filter 1 .

Each of significant locations and can be associated with one or more entry timestamps and one or more exit timestamps. Each entry timestamp can correspond to a time associated with a first location in a location cluster. For example a first entry timestamp associated with significant location can be a timestamp associated with location which is the first location of location cluster . A second entry timestamp associated with significant location can be a timestamp associated with a first location in location cluster . Likewise each exit timestamp can correspond to a time associated with a last location in a location cluster. For example a first exit timestamp associated with significant location can be a timestamp associated with location which is the last location of location cluster . A second entry timestamp associated with significant location can be a timestamp associated with a last location in location cluster .

Each of significant locations and can be associated with a label. The label can be designated by a user e.g. Home Gym or Work or automatically determined by mobile device through reverse geocoding. In some implementations the label can be derived from a semantic analysis of a pattern of the time of day and day of week of each location cluster associated with the significant locations. The semantic analysis can be based on behaviors natural to human beings. Mobile device can be programmed to apply pre determined patterns that reflect the human behavior. The behavior can include for example every human being needs to sleep for some time. The time for sleeping can be a time mobile device is strictly stationary. A user sleeps eight hours a day and eating dinner at home is likely to spend X hours e.g. 10 12 hours at home on weekdays and Y hours on weekends. A user can be at work Monday through Friday for regular hours. Mobile device can leverage these patterns to determine that a significant location as home where 1 mobile device spends more than a first threshold number of hours e.g. 60 hours per week 2 mobile device records most entries and exits and 3 those entries and exists indicate that mobile device stays at least a second threshold number of hours e.g. eight hours per day.

For example mobile device can determine that each location cluster associated with significant location corresponds to a time period designated as evening during weekdays e.g. from 7 00 pm to 8 00 am next day . Mobile device can then designate significant location as home and provide the designation as a label for significant location .

Mobile device can determine transitions from one significant location to another. For example mobile device can determine that on a given weekday mobile device transitions from significant location Home to significant location Work between time T and time T. Mobile device can associate the transition with a transition begin timestamp e.g. T and a transition end timestamp e.g. T . Mobile device can construct state model based on significant locations and and transitions and . Details of state model are described below in reference to .

Mobile device can determine that mobile device transitioned to another location. Mobile device can determine that during one or more time periods the total of which exceeds a threshold time mobile device is located at locations and . The time periods can include for example 8 00 am through 10 00 am on Monday 8 00 am through 9 00 am on Tuesday and 10 00 am through 12 00 pm on Wednesday. The locations can be more spread out than the locations and due to movement of mobile device between features of a work place including a parking lot an office a conference room and a cafeteria compared to movement of mobile device between a living room and a bedroom of a home. Mobile device can determine that locations through converge into a location cluster having a size determined based on distance between locations through by measuring deviation among the locations in the location samples. Mobile device can determine that significant location has a second size corresponding to the size of the location cluster. The second size can be bigger than the first size of significant location resulting from the greater spread among locations through .

In some implementations mobile device can match significant location and significant location with map data. For example mobile device can determine that significant location coincides with building as represented in the map data. In response mobile device can snap a shape of significant location to the shape of building . Likewise mobile device can determine that significant location matches a set of geographic features that includes parking lot office conference room and cafeteria as represented in the map data. In response mobile device can determine a shape of significant location according to a bounding box of parking lot office conference room and cafeteria .

State model can include states and . States and can correspond to significant locations and respectively. Mobile device can determine significant locations and based on location clusters and as described above in reference to . Each of states and can be a representation of significant locations and respectively.

State model can include multiple transitions from each state to each other state. The transitions can include for example transition from state to state and transition from state to state . In state model each transition from state to state can correspond to a transition from a location cluster of significant location to a location cluster of significant location . For example transition can represent transition from location cluster of significant location to location cluster of significant location . Transition can represent a transition from location cluster of significant location to a next location cluster of significant location .

Each of transitions and can be associated with a transition begin timestamp and a transition end timestamp. Each transition begin timestamp can be a time that mobile device leaves significant location represented by state . For example the transition begin timestamp of transition can be Tuesday 7 00 am the transition begin timestamp of transition can be Wednesday 7 00 am. Each transition end timestamp can be a time that mobile device enters significant location represented by state . For example the transition end timestamp of transition can be Tuesday 9 00 am the transition end timestamp of transition can be Wednesday 9 00 am.

Each state of state model can be associated with one or more state entry timestamps and one or more state exit timestamps. For example a first state entry timestamp for state can be a time associated with a first location location of mobile device located in location cluster of significant location . A first state exit timestamp can be a time associated with a last location location of mobile device located in location cluster of significant location . The first state entry timestamp and the first state exit timestamp can define first dwell time of mobile device staying at state . A second state entry timestamp for state can be a time associated with a first location of mobile device located in location cluster of significant location . A second state exit timestamp can be a time associated with a last location of mobile device in location cluster of significant location . The second state entry timestamp and the second state exit timestamp can define second dwell time of mobile device staying at state .

Mobile device can determine that during the time period associated with calendar items and mobile device is located at significant location designated as work and that during the time period associated with calendar item mobile device is located at significant location designated as Palo Alto. Accordingly mobile device can store each of the text strings Cedar Sequoia and Dentist in association with a respective location. For example mobile device can store in a text database each of the text strings Cedar and Sequoia in association with geographic coordinates of significant location and store text string Dentist in associate with geographic coordinates of significant location . Mobile device can provide the stored information to a location service for providing various user assistances.

For example mobile device can receive a calendar item specifying a time in the future e.g. 5 00 pm on a given day six months later. The calendar item can include a text string visit dentist. Mobile device can determine that the text string matches one that is stored in the text database. Accordingly mobile device can determine that a user is likely to visit significant location at 5 00 pm on that given day. On that day mobile device can determine an estimated travel time from a location of mobile device to significant location e.g. 25 minutes. Accordingly mobile device can automatically provide an alert for display at least 25 minutes before 5 00 pm on that day and indicating to the user that the user should start heading for significant location to be on time for the calendar item.

Mobile device can determine new state . For example mobile device can determine that a series of location readings indicate that mobile device is located at a place for a sufficiently long duration that with sufficient certainty that the place is a significant location. Mobile device can determine that the significant location is not represented in state model . In response mobile device can create new state and add new state to state model . Mobile device can add transitions to state based on a last significant location visited by mobile device prior to visiting state . Mobile device can associate state with a state entry timestamp of a first location reading indicating mobile device is located at the significant location of state . Mobile device can associate state with a state exit timestamp of a last location reading indicating mobile device is at the significant location represented by state before mobile device enters another significant location. Mobile device can add transitions from state based on the next significant location visited by mobile device and represented in state model .

In addition to adding states mobile device can periodically remove states from state model . Mobile device can determine that for a sufficiently long time e.g. exceeding an X day or week threshold mobile device has not visited a significant location represented by state . Accordingly mobile device can remove state from state model . Removing state can include removing transitions into state and transitions from state .

Mobile device can use state model to predict a future location of mobile device . Predicting the future location can be based at least in part on a current location of mobile device . The current location can be in state where the current location is represented by a state of state model . Upon determining that the current location is in state mobile device can predict the future location based on transition probability densities between states. The current location can be out of state where the current location is not represented by a state of state model . Upon determining that the current location is out of state mobile device can predict the future location based on entry probability densities of entering a state of state model from the current location. Details on determining the transition probability densities and entry probability densities are described below in reference to .

Transition probability density can be a distribution over a time period e.g. Ta Tb where Ta is a starting time and Tb is an ending time of the time period. The time period Ta Tb can be a window of forecast. In some implementations the starting time Ta can correspond to the current time or the current time with a bias e.g. X minutes before or after the current time the ending time Tb can correspond to the future time or the future time with a bias e.g. Y minutes before or after the future time . In some implementations the starting time Ta and ending time Tb can correspond to a beginning and an ending of a time window e.g. a day or a week respectively.

Mobile device can determine transition probability density based on past transitions of mobile device from state to state . At a given time between Ta and Tb 1 more transitions from state to state in the past at the given time can correspond to a higher probability density value 2 more certainty on the transitions in the past at the given time can correspond to a higher probability density value and 3 a more stable pattern of transitions in the past at the given time can correspond to a higher probability density value.

For example t corresponds to 8 00 am and a corresponds to 3 00 pm. In the past and as recorded in state model X number of transitions occurred between state and state between 7 00 am and 9 00 am and Y number of transitions occurred between 2 00 pm and 4 00 pm. If X is greater than Y t can correspond to comparatively higher probability density value whereas a can correspond to comparatively lower probability density value .

In addition the certainty of the transitions can be relevant. If a mean time of the transition start timestamps of the X transitions is closer to t than a mean time of the transition start timestamps of the Y transition is closer to t t can correspond to comparatively higher probability density value whereas a can correspond to comparatively lower probability density value . If a variance of the transition start timestamps of the X transitions is smaller than a variance of the transition start timestamps of the Y transitions t can correspond to comparatively higher probability density value whereas t can correspond to comparatively lower probability density value .

In addition stability of patterns of transitions in the past can be relevant. Mobile device can determine a pattern of movement based on time. For example mobile device can determine based on transitions in state model that movement of mobile device follows a weekly pattern. On weekdays mobile device transitions from state to state between 7 00 am and 9 00 am. On weekends mobile device transitions from state to state between 2 00 pm and 4 00 pm. Based on this identified weekly pattern mobile device can associate a comparatively higher probability density value for time t if t is in a weekday or associate a comparatively lower probability density value for time t if t is in a weekend day.

Transition probability density can be discrete or continuous. Upon determining transition probability density and other transition probability densities between states of state model mobile device can determine a time based likelihood of mobile device transitioning from a current state e.g. state to each other state directly or indirectly e.g. through one or more intermediate states . Mobile device can determine a predicted future location of mobile device based on the current location the future time and the probabilities of mobile device transitioning to each state.

Entry probability density can be a distribution over a time period e.g. Tc Td where Tc is a starting time and Td is an ending time of the time period. The time period Tc Td can be a window of forecast. In some implementations the starting time Tc can correspond to the current time or the current time with a bias e.g. X minutes before or after the current time the ending time Td can correspond to the future time or the future time with a bias e.g. Y minutes before or after the future time . In some implementations the starting time Tc and ending time Td can correspond to a beginning and ending of a time window e.g. a day or a week respectively.

Mobile device can determine entry probability density based on dwell time of mobile device in state . The dwell time e.g. dwell time and can be determined as described above in reference to .

At a given time between Tc and Td 1 more number of stays of mobile device in state in the past at the given time can correspond to a higher probability density value 2 more certainty on the entry into the state in the past can correspond to a higher probability density value and 3 a more stable pattern of entry into state in the past can correspond to a higher probability density value.

For example t corresponds to 10 00 am and t corresponds to 3 00 pm. In the past and as recorded in state model by dwell time and on X number occasions mobile device is located in state at time t and on Y number occasions mobile device is in state at time t. If X is less than Y e.g. in this example X 2 Y 3 t can correspond to comparatively lower probability density value whereas t can correspond to comparatively lower probability density value .

Additionally or alternatively mobile device can determine based on state dwelling time determined from state model that location of mobile device follows a weekly pattern. For example mobile device can determine that dwell time and a number of other dwell times occur only on weekdays whereas dwell times and occur only on weekends. Based on this identified weekly pattern mobile device can associate lower probability density value to time t and higher probability density value to time t if time t and time t fall on a weekday. Mobile device can associate equal probability density values to time t and time t fall on a weekend day.

Entry probability density can be discrete or continuous. Upon determining entry probability density and other entry probability densities between states of state model mobile device can determine a time based likelihood of mobile device enters from a current location to each other state directly or indirectly e.g. through one or more intermediate states . Mobile device can determine a predicted future location of mobile device based on the current location the future time and the probabilities of mobile device entering each state.

Mobile device can filter out states from state model before during or after calculating the entry probability densities based on various factors. Filtering out a state can include preventing the state being used for a particular location prediction without removing the state from state model . The factors for filtering out a state can include a distance between the current location and the location represented by the state in state model . Mobile device can filter out a state upon determining that during the forecast time window mobile device is unlikely to reach from the current location to the location of that state. Mobile device can perform the filtering based on a time difference between the current time and the starting time or the ending time of the time window and a pre specified maximum speed of movement of mobile device .

For example mobile device can determine that the time difference between the current time and the closing time Td of the forecasting time window is X hours. Mobile device can determine that a distance between the current location and the significant location represented by state is Y kilometers. Based on a pre specified maximum speed of Z kilometers per hour mobile device can filter out state upon determining that X Z

Upon determining that state model does not satisfy the threshold pattern analyzer can determine a daily pattern. The daily pattern can include a probability distribution calculated for each hour of day where for example a probability distribution for 9 00 am to 10 00 am is determined separately from a probability distribution for 5 00 pm to 6 00 pm.

In some implementations pattern analyzer can determine a daily pattern upon determining that mobile device has moved to a new place. For example pattern analyzer can determine that the distances between each of the last X number of new states and each state older than the last X number of new states exceed a local threshold e.g. Y kilometers indicating that mobile device has recently travelled to a new location e.g. to a vacation place . Upon the determination pattern analyzer can determine the daily pattern starting from the last X number of states.

Forecasting subsystem can include prediction engine . Prediction engine is a component of forecasting subsystem configured to receive a current time and a current location and determine a forecast location. Prediction engine can determine a predicted location of mobile device based on the probability densities for transitions and entries provided by probability modeler and the movement patterns provided from pattern analyzer . Prediction engine can identify multiple candidate future locations based on the probability densities and the movement patterns. Prediction engine can then rank the candidate future locations using various attributes.

The attributes used by prediction engine to rank the candidate future locations can include a last visit to a candidate future location as represented by a state where a more recent visit can be associated with a higher ranking. The attributes can include data longevity of the state associated with the candidate location where a state having a longer data history can be associated with a higher ranking.

The system can determine multiple locations of the mobile device. Each location can be associated with a timestamp indicating a time the location was determined by a location determination subsystem. The locations can be ordered sequentially based on timestamps of the locations. Determining the locations can include reading the location e.g. latitude and longitude from the location determination subsystem one at a time. Each reading of the location determination subsystem can be triggered by an activation of the location determination subsystem by an application program requesting a location based service. The system can filter the locations from the location determination subsystem by removing outliers using a statistical filter.

The system can identify a hint indicating that a user of the mobile device had shown interest in performing one or more acts at or in proximity with at least a portion of the locations. The hint can include at least one of a present act performed on the mobile device or detected by the mobile device or a historical record of an act performed on the mobile device or detected by the mobile device.

For example the hint can include a present act. The present act can include a change in motion mode detected by the mobile device indicating that the user has entered or exited a vehicle. The present act can include a power plugin event indicating that the mobile device is plugged into a power charger. The present act can include a network handshake indicating that the mobile device is being connected to a wired or wireless communications network. Additionally or alternatively the hint can include a historical record. The historical record can include a record of a search the search including a search input on the mobile device and a search result including an address of the geographic location. The historical record can include a calendar item indicating an appointment is to occur at the geographic location. The historical record can include a record indicating that the mobile device established a wireless connection to a wireless device located at the geographic location. The historical record can include a record indicating that the mobile device was plugged into a charger device or a computing device at the geographic location. The historical record can include a record of a previous visit by the mobile device at the geographic location.

The system can determine a hint based time threshold for recognizing a location cluster including reducing upon the identified hint a pre specified time threshold for establishing the location cluster.

The system can determine that a set of consecutive locations in the ordered locations form a location cluster upon determining that a time difference among the set of consecutive locations is longer than the hint based time threshold. The location cluster can indicate that the mobile device has dwelled at a geographic location sufficiently long to indicate a sufficient location for the user. Determining that the consecutive locations form the location cluster can occur in real time while the mobile device moves into or out of the geographic location or in batch mode e.g. once every day at 2 00 am.

The system can store the significant location on the mobile device in association with a label of the significant location. The system can designate the significant location as a state in the state model for estimating a place that the user is likely to move to at a future time and for providing predictive user assistance according to the estimated place. The state model can represent each movement of the mobile device from a first significant location to a second significant location as a transition from a first state representing the first significant location to a second state representing the second significant location. The transition being associated with a transition start time and a transition end time.

The system can provide the state model to a forecasting subsystem of the mobile device for generating a forecast that a future location of the mobile device at a given future time is one of the significant locations represented in the state model. The forecast can be based on a current time the future time a current location and a probability density function determined based on the states and transitions of the state model. The system can predict that the mobile device will move to the significant location at a future time based on a past movement pattern of the mobile device.

The system can determine that a series of locations of a mobile device that are recorded in a pre specified convergence threshold amount of time e.g. five hours converge into a location cluster. The location cluster can indicate that a geographic location of the location cluster is a significant location to a user of the mobile device. The series of locations of the mobile device can be recorded during multiple time periods e.g. 7 00 8 00 am on every weekday where each time period is disconnected with another time period. As long as a total amount of time of the time periods when summed up satisfies the pre specified convergence threshold amount of time the system can move to the next stage of operations.

The system can determine a convergence rate of the locations in the location cluster the convergence rate indicating how quickly the locations are clustered together. Determining the convergence rate can occur real time and include determining the convergence rate using locations recorded in a present time period and each prior time period. Determining that the series of locations converge into a location cluster can include determining an initial location X 0 indicating an entry into the location cluster. The system can then receive a series of subsequent locations X 1 X 2 . . . X n . The system can determine whether each respective subsequent location is included in the location cluster using a statistical filter configured to filter out outliers that are too far away from locations already in the location cluster. The statistical filter can include a type of Kalman filter. The system can determine that the series of locations converge into the location cluster upon determining at least a portion of the subsequent locations are included in the location cluster. Determining the convergence rate includes determining a statistical deviation among the locations in the location cluster e.g. by calculating a standard deviation of the locations std X 0 X 1 . . . X n .

The system can determine a size of the location cluster based on the convergence rate. For example a higher convergence rate as indicated by a smaller standard deviation can correspond to a smaller size. After determining the size of the location cluster the system can adjust the size according to additional locations of the mobile device. An increased convergence among the additional locations can reduce the size of the location cluster.

The system can store the size in association with the location cluster. In some implementations the system can designate the significant location as a state in a state model for estimating a place that the user is likely to move to at a future time and for providing predictive user assistance according to the estimated place. The significant location can be associated with the size of the location cluster and representable in a virtual map by a marker having a display size corresponding to the size of the location cluster. Determining the convergence rate determining the size of the location cluster and designating the significant location as the state in the state model can occur in real time while the mobile device determines and records locations of the mobile device. In various implementations the system can identify a venue from map data. The venue can have a location that matches the significant location and have a size that matches the size of the location cluster. The system can snap the significant location to the venue including designating a shape of the venue as a shape of the significant location.

The system can receive from a calendar management application program a record of a calendar item. The record can include a text string describing an event of the calendar item and a time specification of the event. The text string can include a subject line of the calendar item or a text body of the calendar item.

The system can determine a geographic overlap between the significant location and the calendar item. Determining the geographic overlap can include determining that at a time designated in the time specification the mobile device dwells at a significant location of a user of the mobile device. The significant location can include a location that is estimated to have a significant meaning to the user of the mobile device. The significant location can be determined using a location cluster of the mobile device as detected from historical data. Determining that the mobile device dwells at the significant location can include determining that the mobile device is located in a location cluster for at least a threshold amount of time. The location cluster can include detected locations of the mobile device filtered by a statistical filter. In response the system can determine the significant location based on the location cluster.

In response to determining the geographic overlap the system can associate the text string with the significant location. Associating the subject text with the significant location can include storing the text string in association with the significant location on a storage device. Associating the subject text with the significant location can include associating the subject text with the significant location in the calendar application program.

The system can provide a location based service that corresponds to the significant location for a second calendar item of the calendar management application program ahead of a time designated in a time specification of the second calendar item. The system can provide the location based service upon determining that the second calendar item includes at least one term in the text string. Providing the location based service can occur at a time that is determined using the time designated in the time specification of the second calendar item minus an estimated travel time from a current location to the significant location

In some implementations the location based service can include determining that the calendar item is outside of a set of locations associated with a daily routine of the user. The daily routine can include a respective set of likelihood values that the user is located at each of the locations at various times of a day. In response to determining that the calendar item is outside of the set of locations the system can switch a predictive user assistance model from one that is based on the daily routine e.g. work to one that is based on the significant location e.g. a vacation resort in East Palo Alto Calif. .

In some implementations the location based service can include determining that the user will visit the second location at the time designated in a time specification of the second calendar item. In response the system can provide an alert to the user before the user visits the second location. For example a mobile device can determine based on readings of a sensor of the mobile device a mode of transport of the mobile device e.g. walking biking driving or on public transit. The mobile device can then determine a travel time corresponding to the mode of transport and provide the alert that corresponds to the travel time. In some implementations the mobile device can receive motion classifiers from the mobile device or from a server indicating that the mobile device is traveling in a particular mode. The mobile device can reclassify the classifier using the mode of transport as context information. Accordingly the mobile device can use the context information to filter out one or more motion classifiers that misclassifies a motion.

The mobile device can receive an input. The input can request the mobile device to monitor locations of the mobile device to determine a length of time the mobile device has dwelled at a location. The mobile device can determine that the location is a significant location for a user of the mobile device upon determining that the length of time satisfies a configurable threshold.

Responsive to the input the mobile device can monitor the locations through an API. Monitoring the locations can include calling a start monitoring instance function also referred to as a start monitoring instance method of an object of a location manager class. The start monitoring instance function can be declared in the API and configured to perform actions of recording detected visits of the mobile device at the locations. Each detected visit can be associated with a respective set of geographic coordinates of a location that the mobile device visited. Recording the detected visits can include storing the detected visits as data objects on a storage device or sending a visit callback to a pre specified function to notify the pre specified function of an aspect of a detected visit. The aspect of the detected visit can include at least one of an arrival of the mobile device at a location or a departure of the mobile device from the location.

In some implementations each detected visit can be recorded as an object of a location visit class the object having an arrival date attribute storing a date the visit began a departure date attribute storing a date the visit ended a coordinate attribute storing geographic coordinates of a center of a region visited by the mobile device and a horizontal accuracy attribute storing an estimated radius of the region visited. The object of the location visit class can be specified in a class declaration to conform to a secure coding protocol and a copying protocol each of the secure coding protocol and copying protocol defining a manner that the object sends a message to another object.

Responsive to a trigger event the mobile device can stop the monitoring. Stopping the monitoring can include calling a stop monitoring instance function also referred to as a stop monitoring instance method of the object. The stop monitoring instance function can be declared in the API and being operable to stop the object of the location manager class to record the visits. The trigger event can include a user input a timeout event or an interruption event.

Each of the start monitoring instance function and the stop monitoring instance function can be an asynchronous function that once called performs their respective operations without requiring a caller to wait for a result before performing other actions. Each of the start monitoring instance function and the stop monitoring instance function is associated with a compiler hint in the API. The compiler hint indicating a compatible version of an operating system for the API.

The mobile device can provide the recorded visits to location consumer. The location consumer can be a significant location determination engine for determining location coordinates of the significant location and a size of the significant location using the sets of geographic coordinates in the recorded visits.

The API can be defined in an object oriented programming language e.g. Objective C or C programming language in a header file. The start monitoring instance function can declared in the API as having a name of startMonitoringVisits and a void type. The stop monitoring instance function can be declared in the API as having a name of stopMonitoringVisits and a void type. Each name of the respective instance function is indicative of underlying operations of the respective function to a developer programming using the API. Pseudo code for the API is provided below in Listing 1.

Mobile device can determine using a current time the future time and a current location of the mobile device as inputs a probability for associating with each state in the state model. If the request does not include the current location mobile device can determine the current location using location determination subsystem . Mobile device can determine the probabilities based on the states transitions and associating timestamps. The probabilities can indicate a likelihood that mobile device will be located at each respective location corresponding to a state at the future time.

Determining the probability to be associated with each state can include determining an entry probability density of mobile device entering a location corresponding to each state from the out of state current location. Determining the entry probability density can be based on a dwell time mobile device is in each state. Mobile device can determine the dwell time based on one or more entry timestamps and one or more exit timestamps associated with the respective state.

In some implementations determining the probability for associating with each state can be based on a daily weekly monthly or annual pattern. Mobile device can determine whether the state model satisfies a longevity threshold e.g. X weeks . Mobile device can determine a first activity pattern upon determining the state model satisfies the longevity threshold. The first activity pattern can correspond to a first time span e.g. a week . Alternatively mobile device can determine a second activity pattern upon determining that the state model does not satisfy the longevity threshold. The second activity pattern can correspond to a second time span e.g. a day . The first time span can be longer than the second time span. Mobile device can determine the probability based on the current time the future time and the first activity pattern or second activity pattern. Mobile device can then determine the probability for associating with each state based on the current time the future time and the first activity pattern or second activity pattern.

In some implementations mobile device can filter the states in the state model based on a distance between the current location and each location represented in the state model and a difference between the current time and the future time. Mobile device can filter out the states that given the difference in time and given a moving speed of mobile device a likelihood that mobile device reaches the state from the current location falls below a threshold value.

Based on the probabilities mobile device can provide at least one location associated with a state as a predicted future location of mobile device in response to the request. In some implementations providing the location as the predicted future location can include identifying a state associated with a highest probability and designating the location associated with the state associated with the highest probability as the predicted future location. In some implementations providing the location as the predicted future location can include ranking the states based on the probabilities and one or more forecast attributes and designating the location associated with a highest rank as the predicted future location.

The forecast attributes can include a time of last visit to each corresponding location. The forecast attributes can include a derived likelihood for a forecast window based on the current location the current time and a forecast window length. The forecast attributes can include a temporal length of the state model. The forecast attributes can include an aggregated dwell time at each state. The forecast attributes can include a number of visits at each state.

In some implementations mobile device can determine that a data density of the state model satisfies a sparse model threshold. In response mobile device can determine the probability for associating with each state in a sparse operating mode. In the sparse operating mode probability density calculations and rankings can be performed in a less stringent matter than the calculations and rankings in normal operating mode.
