The present disclosure relates to medical monitoring and more particularly relates to systems methods and devices for patient activity monitoring.

Modern medical practice makes extensive use of electronic monitoring of vital signs and other physiological parameters of patients. In some cases remote monitoring of physiological parameters or telemetry is used to allow nurses doctors and or computing devices to determine the health of a patient or detect problems with the patient when the nurse doctor or other medical worker is not physically present with the patient. In some cases wireless telemetry devices worn by a patient may allow the patient to move around and or be easily moved between locations while maintaining monitoring of the patient s vital signs. One example of a portable telemetry device is the Mindray Telepack .

One aspect of patient health that may be of importance to medical workers is how much the patient moves or ambulates. For example bed ridden patients may need to be periodically moved or rolled over to reposition the patient and reduce the formation of bed sores. Similarly periodic ambulation or walking may be good for the mental and physical health of a patient. In some situations patients should not leave their bed without assistance due to weakness and or likelihood of falling. However tracking patient activity or movement is not available using current telemetry devices and systems. Rather nurses or other medical workers are required to either physically monitor the patient or ask the patient questions to determine how much the patient has been moving. Interviewing patients can be time consuming and subject to error.

In light of the foregoing Applicants disclose devices systems and methods for monitoring physical activity or movement of a patient. In one embodiment a portable telemetry device includes a physiological component a movement component a wireless radio and a communication component. The physiological component is configured to receive from at least one sensor physiological data representative of a physiological condition of a patient. The movement component is configured to detect movement of the portable telemetry device and generate movement data. In one embodiment the portable telemetry device is configured to attach to the patient. The wireless radio is configured to wirelessly send radio signals. The communication component is configured to transmit the physiological data and the movement data to a monitoring system using the wireless radio.

In one embodiment the portable telemetry device may detect an activity level of the patient e.g. how much the patient moves within a period of time. In one embodiment the portable telemetry device may identify a movement activity. For example the portable telemetry device may determine that a patient has moved from a lying or sitting position to a standing position. Other movement activities may also be identified including sitting walking rolling over or the like. In one embodiment an alarm may be triggered in response to the detection of an event. In one embodiment identifying movement activities and or triggering alarms may be performed locally at the portable telemetry device or by a remote monitoring system.

Turning to the figures is a schematic diagram illustrating a monitoring system and a portable telemetry device for medical telemetry. In one embodiment the portable telemetry device includes a telemetry device worn by a patient. For example the patient may be free to walk or move while wearing the portable telemetry device due to size weight and or capability for wireless communication.

The portable telemetry device may include a portable device comprising a housing containing a processor circuitry computer readable memory an antenna radios and or the like. The portable telemetry device may have a size such that it can be worn by a patient while allowing the patient to move freely. The portable telemetry device may include one or more ports for coupling to sensors and receiving signals from the sensors. The portable telemetry device may include a human machine interface which may include a display one or more buttons and or indicator lights to allow a human to determine a status of the portable telemetry device enter information or otherwise interact with the portable telemetry device .

The portable telemetry device is in wireless communication with the monitoring system . Connected to the portable telemetry device are a plurality of sensors which may be used to measure patient parameters and or obtain patient waveforms. For example the sensors may include one or more electrocardiography ECG sensors a pulse oximetry sensor e.g. SpO and or any other sensors. The portable telemetry device may receive signals from the sensors as analog or digital data signals indicating a physiological condition of a patient. The portable telemetry device may also obtain movement data from a movement sensor connected to the portable telemetry device or integrated within the housing of the portable telemetry device . In one embodiment the portable telemetry device may send physiological parameters and movement data to the monitoring system . For example the portable telemetry device may forward processed or unprocessed sensor data to the monitoring system so that a doctor a nurse and or other medical personnel can monitor a condition of the patient.

The monitoring system may include a computing device such as a computer a server or the like. The monitoring system may include a processor circuitry computer readable memory an antenna radios communication ports and or the like. In one embodiment the monitoring system includes a computing system. For example the monitoring system may include a computing system for a nursing station an intensive care ward a step down ward and or an in patient ward.

The monitoring system receives the physiological data and movement data from the portable telemetry device and stores and or processes the data. In one embodiment the monitoring system stores the physiological data and movement data in memory for later access and or analysis. In one embodiment the monitoring system processes the physiological data and or movement data to detect problems in relation to the patient detect whether there is an alarm condition or perform other analysis. For example the monitoring system may report an alarm condition to a nurse a doctor or other medical personnel.

The monitoring system may also provide control data to the portable telemetry device to configure alarm settings reset alarms determine a state or location of the portable telemetry device transfer stored data or otherwise configure operation of the portable telemetry device . In one embodiment the monitoring system may send and receive control data between the portable telemetry device to determine that messages were received or that instructions corresponding to control data were performed.

The physiological component is configured to receive physiological data of a patient. The physiological data may be based on signals or data received from one or more sensors in communication with the portable telemetry device . For example the physiological component may receive signals or data from the one or more sensors of that are connected to the portable telemetry device . The physiological data may include ECG data SpOdata or any other type of data representative of a physiological condition of the patient.

The movement component is configured to detect movement of the patient. In one embodiment the movement component may detect movement of the patient by detecting movement of the portable telemetry device . For example the portable telemetry device may be connected or attached to a patient so that when the patient moves the portable telemetry device moves with the patient. In one embodiment the movement component includes an accelerometer such as a three axis accelerometer. The accelerometer may be mounted within a housing of the portable telemetry device . The accelerometer may produce one or more electrical signals to indicate movements rotations and or accelerations of the portable telemetry device .

The wireless radio may include a radio that is configured to communicate wirelessly using radio signals. The wireless radio may be configured to operate according to a wireless standard. Example wireless standards include an institute for electrical and electronics engineers IEEE 802.11 standard known to industry groups as Wi Fi a cellular communication standard such as 3GPP LTE a Bluetooth standard or another standard. Similarly the wireless radio may be configured to operate within a licensed or unlicensed band. One example of licensed bands in the United States includes the wireless medical telemetry service WMTS bands which include dedicated protected bands which have been allocated for medical telemetry purposes. One example of unlicensed bands includes the widely used industrial scientific and medical ISM radio bands. The frequency band and standard may vary considerably and may allow the portable telemetry device to communicate with a monitoring system .

The communication component is configured to communicate data with the monitoring system . For example the communication component may transmit the physiological data from the physiological component and the movement data from the movement component to a monitoring system using the wireless radio . In one embodiment the communication component transmits physiological data or movement data that has been generated by the physiological component or movement component . For example signals from a sensor or an accelerometer may be converted to a digital format or other format that can be understood and processed by the monitoring system . In one embodiment some data may be transmitted in a raw format e.g. analog or sampled format to be processed by the monitoring system .

The communication component may also communicate other types of data such as alarm data or control data. In one embodiment the movement component may receive control data to configure operation of the portable telemetry device . For example the control data may indicate that certain types of parameters are to be gathered and sent or that certain types of parameters are no longer needed. In one embodiment the communication component may receive information that indicates a threshold level for an alarm or a type of event or movement activity that should trigger an alarm. In one embodiment the communication component may transmit an indication that an alarm condition has been detected.

The activity component is configured to detect or identify a movement activity based on movement data from the movement component . In one embodiment the activity component detects movement activities performed by the patient based on movement detected by the movement component . For example the activity component may process one or more output sensors from an accelerometer to identify what a patient is doing. Different movements have different signatures which can be detected. In one embodiment the activity component may detect an activity movement including information about a current static position of a patient. For example if a three axis accelerometer is used an orientation of the portable telemetry device can be determined and a corresponding position of the patient may be detected. For example the activity component may determine whether the patient is standing in a reclined seated position or lying down. As another example the activity component may determine whether the patient is moving or resting mostly stationary except for breathing or other minor muscle movements producing movement data below a threshold .

In one embodiment the activity component may detect a movement activity that involves physical movement. For example the movement activity may detect a waveform signature from an accelerometer corresponding to the patient standing up sitting down walking or the like. In one embodiment the activity component may detect a patient standing up from a sitting or lying position by detecting a rest position and a short upward acceleration followed by a slowing and stop in the upward acceleration. In one embodiment the activity component may detect a patient walking by detecting periodic up down accelerations corresponding to steps of the patient. In one embodiment the activity component may detect the patient sitting down by detecting a rest followed by a short downward acceleration and then a stop in the downward acceleration. In one embodiment the activity component may detect the patient rolling over by detecting a rolling of the portable telemetry device . For example the portable patient monitor may have little horizontal movement along one axis while rolling about that axis. One of skill in the art will recognize in light of the present disclosure considerable variation in how different movement activities of the patient may be detected.

In one embodiment the activity component may determine an activity level of the patient. For example the activity component may count a number of movements of the patient per minute that exceeded a movement threshold. This activity level may be provided to a medical worker who can see a most current activity level or review the activity level of the patient over time.

In one embodiment the activity component may compare the movement data with data from one or more sensors to determine the movement activity. For example an ECG signal may show that a patient is currently physically exerting himself or herself while the movement data indicates that the patient is rolling over. The activity component may be able to determine that the physiological data and movement data corresponds to each other and indicates that the patient is rolling himself or herself over in bed. Similar other correlations may be used to reduce false positive detections of movements or confirm the occurrence of a movement.

The alarm component is configured to provide an alarm in response to an alarm condition. In one embodiment the alarm component provides an alarm in response to a movement activity. For example an alarm condition may be set up to trigger an alarm in response to detection of a movement activity detected by the activity component . In one embodiment an alarm may be triggered in response to a patient standing up. For example there are some situations where patients are too unhealthy to stand or walk on their own. In these situations an alarm may be configured to notify a nurse or other medical worker if the patient stands or is attempting to stand. Thus medical personnel can quickly go assist the patient before any fall or injury is sustained.

The monitoring component is configured to receive data from the portable telemetry device . The monitoring component may also store or evaluate the data. In one embodiment the monitoring component processes physiological parameters to detect alarm conditions or a health status of one or more patients with one or more corresponding portable telemetry devices . For example a nurse or other medical worker may be able to remotely monitor the patient s physiological status by viewing sensor data for the patient. The monitoring component may also receive movement data for processing or storage or may provide the movement data to the movement tracking component activity component or alarm component .

The movement tracking component is configured to track movement activities of one or more patients over time. In one embodiment the movement tracking component may generate reports indicating movement activity of a patient. For example the movement tracking component may generate statistical data or information indicating how much a patient has moved or performed specific movement activities during a time period based on information provided by the portable telemetry device . In one embodiment the movement tracking component tracks a number of occurrences of a movement activity over a specific time period. For example the movement tracking component may determine that a patient has rolled over in bed a specific number of times during the night. In one embodiment the movement tracking component tracks a percentage of time or total number of hours during which a patient is moving or walking. For example the movement tracking component may determine a percentage of time during the day that the patient spends walking. Similarly the movement tracking component may track a percentage of time or total number of hours during which the patient is resting or lying down. In one embodiment the movement tracking component may determine how long it has been since a patient went on a walked or rolled over in bed. If the patient hasn t walked or rolled over in bed for a threshold amount of time a nurse or other medical worker may be dispatched to help the patient.

The movement tracking component may generate information to log the occurrence of any movement activities. For example the activity component of the portable telemetry device or monitoring system may detect a movement activity and the movement tracking component may log a date time location or other information corresponding to the occurrence of the movement activity. A nurse a doctor or other medical worker may later review the information to determine how active the patient is. The movement tracking component may tag a portion of the movement data e.g. accelerometer output data with the corresponding activity movement log data. Thus a medical worker may be able to come along later to review the data and what occurred with the patient.

Returning to the monitoring system may also include an activity component and alarm component . The activity component and alarm component may include any of the functionality or features as discussed above in relation to the portable telemetry device . For example the functionality of the activity component and alarm component may be performed at the monitoring system instead of at the portable telemetry device .

The method begins and a physiological component receives physiological data representative of a physiological condition of a patient. For example the portable telemetry device may be connected to one or more sensors such as ECG or SpOsensors to monitor a physiological condition of the patient. The physiological component may receive the physiological data in digital or analog format from the sensors .

A movement component detects movement of the portable telemetry device and generates movement data. The movement data may include sensor data or a waveform from an accelerometer or other sensor that can detect physical movement. In one embodiment portable telemetry device is configured to attach to the patient so that the movement data also corresponds to the patient. In one embodiment the portable telemetry device is attached to the patient such that the portable telemetry device rotates tilts and moves with the patient.

A communication component transmits the physiological data and the movement data to a monitoring system using a wireless radio . For example the monitoring system may monitor the physiological parameters and movement data to allow a nurse or other medical worker to track movement of the patient as well as monitor a physiological condition. Thus a medical worker may be able to determine what needs a patient has for physical activity movement or repositioning based on how active the patient has been.

The method begins and a monitoring component receives physiological data representative of a physiological condition of a patient and movement data corresponding to movements of the patient. For example the monitoring component may receive the physiological data and movement data from one or more portable telemetry devices which are used to monitor one or more corresponding patients.

An activity component determines a movement activity corresponding to at least a portion of the movement data. The activity component may determine the movement activity based on a waveform signature generated by an accelerometer such as a three axis accelerometer of a portable telemetry device . The activity component may identify a specific activity and associate the specific activity with the movement data. In one embodiment the activity component may determine whether a patient was assisted or unassisted during an activity. For example the activity component may determine whether a nurse was with the patient when the patient rolled over. In one embodiment a nurse may select an option on the portable telemetry device to indicate that the nurse is present so that the activity component can determine that movement activities were assisted.

A movement tracking component tracks movement activities of the patient over time. For example the movement tracking component may track how many movement activities of a certain type are performed or may track an activity level of a patient. In one embodiment the movement tracking component tracks the time since a specific movement activity has occurred. For example the movement tracking component may track how long it has been since a patient has rolled over gone on a walk or the like. The movement tracking component may provide information regarding tracked activities to a medical worker.

Various techniques or certain aspects or portions thereof may take the form of program code i.e. instructions embodied in tangible media such as floppy diskettes CD ROMs hard drives a non transitory computer readable storage medium or any other machine readable storage medium wherein when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine such as a computer the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the various techniques. In the case of program code execution on programmable computers the computing device may include a processor a storage medium readable by the processor including volatile and non volatile memory and or storage elements at least one input device and at least one output device.

However the program s may be implemented in assembly or machine language if desired. In any case the language may be a compiled or an interpreted language and combined with hardware implementations.

It should be understood that many of the functional units described in this specification may be implemented as one or more components which is a term used to more particularly emphasize their implementation independence. For example a component may be implemented as a hardware circuit comprising custom very large scale integration VLSI circuits or gate arrays off the shelf semiconductors such as logic chips transistors or other discrete components. A component may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays programmable array logic programmable logic devices or the like.
