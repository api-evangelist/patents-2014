This application is a NON PROVISIONAL of claims priority to and incorporates by reference in its entirety U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 798 789 filed on Mar. 15 2013 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 803 330 filed on Mar. 19 2013.

The present invention relates to methods and systems for interfacing a plurality of endpoints of a video conference system with a plurality of encoders at a server of the video conference system.

In previous video conferencing methods and systems there may be a 1 to 1 mapping between endpoints and encoders as depicted in . Alternatively there may be an n to 1 mapping between endpoints and encoders i.e. mapping from n endpoints to 1 encoder as depicted in . A drawback of the first approach is that it is expensive to deploy due to the high number of encoders relative to the number of endpoints. A drawback of the second approach is that it provides a relatively low encoding quality because the audio video streams must be encoded using the capabilities of the lowest bit rate endpoint out of the group of endpoints.

An object of the present invention is to provide methods and systems for video conferencing in which many endpoints may be connected to a small number of encoders. Another object of the present invention is to provide methods and systems for video conferencing in which a small number of working points allow for a wide range of endpoint capabilities e.g. wide range of resolution and bandwidth .

In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.

In one embodiment of the present invention the number of working points is determined statistically using the capabilities of the endpoints. Once the working points are established one encoder is created for each working point. All of the encoders may work in conjunction with one another sharing the majority of the encoding process. Only a small amount of extra CPU resources may be needed for each additional encoder.

In one embodiment of the present invention each endpoint when it connects to the video conference system gets assigned to the best encoder that can service it based on parameters such as the resolution needed by the endpoint and the bandwidth available to the endpoint. As any of these parameters may vary during the call the endpoint may be dynamically switched to a different encoder that is operating at a different working point.

Various techniques of the present invention may be applied to both a unidirectional streaming video application or to a bi directional interactive video application. Various techniques of the present invention may additionally be used with existing video codecs that follow an open standard in such a way that endpoints connecting to the encoders do not need to be modified in any way and are not aware of multiple encoders being present. This allows unmodified endpoints to be used. Various techniques of the present invention may be used in a variety of contexts including but not limited to presentation sharing screen sharing motion video and the like. Since embodiments of the present invention may work with open standard video codecs these embodiments avoid the need to use a proprietary codec for screen sharing to achieve a large fan out of presentation receivers. Most systems on the market today resort to using a proprietary video codec to send screen sharing whereas some embodiments of the present invention can use an open standard video codec and hence be compatible with many off the shelf endpoints that can receive this screen sharing stream.

The video conference system configured in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention may provide a user interface for presentation of the received data streams for a video conference. In some embodiments the video conference system may support the operation of a video conference such as a conference with a virtual media room or virtual meeting room VMR user interface wherein each VMR user interface may present data from a plurality of endpoints e.g. devices of participants in the video conference at one or more geographic locations.

The video conference system is described in more detail with reference to and as illustrated may support a variety of video conferencing feeds of audio video audio and video and or other media data streams from video conferencing participant endpoints to present a video conference. Endpoints may be any type of device including but not limited to laptops computers smartphones tablets phones audio and video conferencing system devices and or any other device capable of sending and receiving data streams over a network. Participants may use proprietary or standards based communication protocols with their devices and the video conference system may enable a multi party and or point to point e.g. between two endpoints video conference session among the plurality of participant endpoints.

As a non limiting example video data streams from proprietary video conference endpoints using proprietary communication protocols implemented for client applications include but are not limited to the following Microsoft Skype application Polycom video conference applications Microsoft Lync applications Google Talk applications web applications capable of real time communication and or any other application providing communication services. Video data streams from standards based video conference endpoints include but are not limited to H.323 and Session Initiation Protocol SIP . Additionally the video conference system may support data streams from a media gateway that converts digital media streams between disparate telecommunication networks such as from devices using public switched telephone networks PSTN SS7 and Next Generation Networks. Each video conference can be implemented and supported across an infrastructure of a globally distributed set of commodity servers acting as media processing nodes co located in Points of Presence POPs for Internet access wherein such a distributed architecture can support thousands of simultaneously active video conferences in a reservation less manner and that is transparent to the user participants. Each video conference provides users with a rich set of conferencing and collaboration interaction.

These interactions encompass the control of a video conference session its configuration the visual layout of the data streams from the conference participants customization of the user interface and adaptation of a video conference to integrate with and present data streams from different client applications e.g. chat whiteboards Microsoft Skype etc. . For a non limiting example one such use of the video conference system is to facilitate conferences between two disparate endpoints such as a client application for a proprietary system from a communication service provider e.g. a Skype client and an application for a standards based H.323 endpoint. Continuing with the example the Skype user may initiate a video conference with another user and have no knowledge of the other user s endpoint technology e.g. client application and the video conference system may host a video conference session and instantiate media processing components elements to translate data streams as needed transcode data streams as needed and create a composite of data streams received from the disparate endpoints.

A globally distributed infrastructure for the video conference system supports the sharing of the event e.g. the session among the participants at geographically distributed locations with the use of a plurality of MCUs Multipoint Control Units each configured to process the plurality of audio and or video streams from the plurality of video conference endpoints in real time. Those with skill in the art will recognize that a globally distributed infrastructure is not required to practice the invention. A geographically distributed architecture and or simply a distributed architecture may be implemented to practice the invention.

Compared to conventional video conference system approaches that require every participant to the video conference to follow the same communication standard or protocol and or use the same client application from a communication service provider a video conference supported by the globally distributed infrastructure with at least one MCU at a media server allows the participants of a video conference to participate in a multi party or point to point video conference session in device address scheme protocol and or communication service provider independent fashion. By conducting manipulation of the video and audio streams transparently in on a remote server e.g. a server of a POP that is accessible via one or more networks or networks of networks without end user involvement the proposed approach brings together video conference systems and applications of different devices different protocols of video conferencing and or different communication services from communication service providers as one integrated system. Communication service providers may include but are not limited to the following providers of Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP instant messaging services supporting voice and or data and or service provider with applications that allow for transport of information electronically.

In particular the video conference system provides the integration of services from different communication service providers e.g. Skype and Google Talk that support different addressing schemes for identifying users on devices. For example a participant user may login to a Skype client to join a video conference using a communication service identifier e.g. username Skype id and communicate with a participant user who logins to a Google Talk client using an email address. Ordinarily a communication service provider may require a user to identify each participant on the communication session with an identifier registered with the communication service e.g. communication service identifier email address username etc. so that the communication service provider may look up the address of the user endpoint to communicate and the communication service provider may not support integration with other communication services. The video conference system integrates with the communication service provider services system seamlessly for the user so that the user can login with any client application with an identifier registered with the communication service provider and participate in the video conference.

In some embodiments the endpoint for a participant using a client application is communicating with a corresponding client application for the communication service provider executing as a virtual client application on a server in the backend. A virtual client application is a client application that may be executed on a server of the video conference system to receive data streams from the client application executing on a participant endpoint device and the output or presentation of the data streams within the virtual client application may be captured and combined with other data streams to form a composite for the video conference. Examples of approaches to video conference systems that support different communication services are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 105 684 entitled Systems and Methods for Real Time Multimedia Communication across multiple standards and proprietary devices filed on May 11 2011 issued as U.S. Pat. No. 9 035 997 on May 19 2015 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Hosting the video conference on at least one media server accessible on a network e.g. Internet cloud allows for the participants to initiate a video conference with any device supporting any communication protocol and any client application from a communication service provider have the system communicate with the other participants at each of their selected endpoint devices and the other participants may accept the request to join the video conference from any endpoint device using any client application from any communication service provider that he she wishes. A video conference hosted on a server accessible over the Internet cloud enables any participant to be able to upload media content to a server i.e. a node of the global distributed infrastructure accessible over the Internet e.g. in the cloud and have it be retransmitted to other participants in formats of their choice transparently with or without modifications.

In the example of the globally distributed infrastructure that supports and enables the operations of the video conference has at least one or more of the following attributes 

In some embodiments globally distributed infrastructure may be implemented with clusters of x86 servers both locally on a LAN as well as across geographies serving as the media processing nodes for the MCUs to achieve near unlimited scaling. All of the media processing nodes of the clusters e.g. and may work together forming one giant MCU. In some embodiments such clustered design makes use of network layer multicast and a novel multi bit rate stream distribution scheme to achieve the unlimited scaling. The globally distributed infrastructure is able to achieve great scalability in terms of the number of participants per call geographic distribution of callers as well as distribution of calls across multiple POPs worldwide.

By way of a non limiting example globally distributed infrastructure has the media processing node MCUs distributed around the globe in POPs e.g. United States US Network POP US Core Media POP Asia Pacific APAC Media POP APAC Network POP and European Union EU Core Media POP at data centers e.g. third party data centers to process video conference feeds coming from video conference endpoints having different communication protocols and or using different client applications from communication service providers. Those with skill in the art will recognize that an implementation of the globally distributed infrastructure for the video conference system with the same number and or geographic locations for Core Media and or Network POPs of is not required and any number of Core Media POPs and Network POPs may be used to provide a content delivery network for a video conference system. In some embodiments each Core Media POP may have the processing power e.g. servers to handle the load for that geographical region where the POP is located. Users participants connecting to the video conference system may be directed to the closest Core Media POP e.g. the connector at a POP described in more detail with that can handle the processing for the conference so as to allow them to minimize their latency.

Once the participants are in communication with a POP of the globally distributed infrastructure their conference feeds of audio and video streams can be carried on a high performance network POPs e.g. US Network POP APAC Network POP between the POPs. Additionally in some embodiments Network POPs e.g. US Network POP APAC Network POP can be used for communication e.g. traffic with users in places where a Core Media POP does not exist. By way of example an endpoint can communicate with a Network POP in a more optimal location for communication than the nearest Core Media POP and the Network POP may send forward the traffic to a Core Media POP over a private dedicated network so as to avoid use of the open Internet. The globally distributed infrastructure enables media processing nodes to act as one single system.

In some embodiments the globally distributed infrastructure may have multiple other globally distributed private networks to connect to it including but not limited to deployments of video conferencing services such as Microsoft Lync that require federation i.e. cooperation among multiple organizational entities at edge nodes and translation and decoding of several communication and transport protocols.

Some components which include but are not limited to the following components user account management billing system NOC Network operation center systems for bootstrapping monitoring and node management may be run at one or more centralized but redundant management nodes in the Business Data Layer . Other components which include but are not limited to common application framework and platform e.g. Linux x86 CPUs GPUs package management clustering can be run on both the distributed nodes and the centralized management nodes.

Each of the protocol connector nodes in the Proxy Layer may receive audio video data streams utilizing proprietary or standards based communication protocols and may translate the received data into a common protocol e.g. Real Time Transport Protocol RTP . The received data in the common protocol may then be sent to media servers for transcoding and composition mixing by media servers of the Worker Layer such operation of the media servers used to form composite data streams for the endpoints. Translating when needed may include receiving the data packets of a data stream communicated using a first communication protocol and retransmitting the received data packets using a second communication protocol. While the communication protocol in which the data stream is communicated is changed the actual data packets may remain unchanged. In contrast transcoding when needed may include decoding data e.g. data packets in a received first communication protocol to an intermediate format and encoding the data into a common target format for a common target communication protocol. Other implementations may provide for transcoding to be performed at the proxy layer with a protocol connector node .

In some embodiments global infrastructure provides a high level mechanism for fault tolerant protocol handling to prevent improper input from causing instability and possible security breach via protocol connector or media servers . Media processing tasks by protocol connectors and or media servers such as processing of protocol control messages and compressing audio and video streams may be isolated in one or more separate independent unprivileged processes. More specifically 

In some embodiments media processing servers are designed to convert and compose several videoconference feeds of video and audio streams in real time to create and render one or more composite multimedia streams for each participant to the video conference e.g. VMR . Media processing servers may include as its components one or more of video compositor video transcoder distributed multicast video switch audio transcoder pre processor distributed multicast audio mixer and each component may be in communication with protocol connector and a distributed conference session controller. In the case of video the video streams from the participants are made available at the media processing server in three or more forms original compressed video uncompressed raw video and a lower resolution compressed thumbnail video.

By way of example a video compositor of a module executing on a media processing node subscribes to whichever video stream it needs based on the set of videos needed to compose and be rendered to the participants. The two or more compressed forms of the video streams listed above may be transcoded by video transcoder sent by distributed multicast video switch using a multicast address on the network so that other remote media processing nodes that want these video streams can subscribe to them as needed. This scheme allows the entire cluster of nodes locally and globally to share and or exchange the audio and video streams they need in the most efficient manner. These streams could be transmitted over the public Internet over a private network or over a provisioned overlay network with service level guarantees. Using this approach video compositor may show various composites including but limited to just the active speaker two people side by side if they are having a conversation and any other custom format as requested by a participant which may include transformations of the video into other representations as well. Continuing with the example a video transcoder of media processing server encodes and decodes composite video streams efficiently where characteristics of each individual stream can be extracted during decoding.

In some embodiments video compositor not only composes the raw video stream into a composite video stream but also builds up a composite metadata field in order to apply similar operations including both 2D and 3D operations outlined in the metadata field to the individual video streams of the composite video. As a non limiting example motion vectors need to be applied with the same transformation that video compositor may apply to each raw video stream including but not limited to scaling rotation translation shearing. This metadata could be used for other non real time multimedia services including but not limited to recorded streams and annotated streams for offline search and indexing.

In some embodiments application server e.g. a user experience engine renders multimedia content including but not limited to the composite audio video stream to each of the participants to the video conference for an enhanced User Experience UE for the participants. The UE provided by the application server to the participants may comprise one or more of the following areas 

Despite the fact that most conventional video conference systems cost tens of thousands of dollars they offer very limited freedom and flexibility to the call organizer or to any participants in terms of controlling the user experience during the call. The layouts come pre configured to a select few options and the settings that can be modified during a call are also limited.

In some embodiments application server provides moderator initiated in meeting session management and control over security and privacy settings during a particular video conference call wherein such management and control features include but are not limited to muting a particular speaker at the video conference controlling and or broadcasting layouts associated with one of the video conference endpoints to all or a subset of the participants and sharing additional materials selectively with a subset of the participants for a non limiting example in an HR vertical application where multiple interviewers are interviewing one candidate in a common call .

By offering the video conferencing service over the Internet cloud application server eliminates a lot of these limitations of the conventional video conference systems. For a non limiting example application server enables participant s associated different types of video conference endpoints to talk to each other over the Internet during the video conference. For a non limiting example participants from H.323 endpoints can to talk to participants from desktop clients such as Skype and both the moderator and the participants can choose from a wide variety of options. In addition by providing the ability to terminate the service in the cloud application server enables access to a much richer set of features for a conference call that a participant can use compared to a conventional passively bridged conference call. More specifically every participant can have control of one or more of 

 1 Which active participants to the session to view in his her video windows on the screen of his her video conference endpoint.

 2 Layout options for how the different participants should be shown on the screen of his her video conference endpoint.

 3 Layout options on where and how to view the secondary video channel screen sharing presentation sharing shared viewing of other content on the screen of his her video conference endpoint.

Using such in meeting controls a moderator can control security and privacy settings for the particular call in ways. The moderator of the call in addition to the aforementioned options has a richer suite of options to pick from through a web interface to manage and control the video conference which include but are not limited to 

In some embodiments application server enables private conferences by creating sub rooms in main VMR that any subset of the participants to the main VMR could join and have private chats. For a non limiting example participants can invite others for a quick audio video or text conversation while being on hold in the main VMR.

A shared experience of events among participants to a video conference often requires all participants to be physically present at the same place. Otherwise when it happens over the Internet the quality is often very poor and the steps needed to achieve this are quite challenging for the average person to pursue this as a viable technological option.

In some embodiments application server provides collaborative viewing of events through VMRs that can be booked and shared among the participants so that they are able to experience the joy of simultaneously participating in an event and sharing the experience together via a video conference. For a non limiting example the shared event can be a Super Bowl game that people want to enjoy with friends or a quick session to watch a few movie trailers together among a group of friends to decide which one to go watch in the theater.

In some embodiments application server utilizes the MCUs of the global infrastructure to offer an easy quick and high quality solution for event sharing. More specifically application server enables one initiating participant to invite a group of other participants for a shared video conference call via a web application. Once everyone joins in the VMR to share online videos and content an initiating participant may provide a uniform resource locator URL where the content is located and the content may be streamed into a VMR directly from the content source whether the content is local to the initiating participant device or located remotely and accessed over the Internet from a third party web site or content store. Participants may continue to have conversations with other participants while watching this content. Other features provided include but are not limited to altering the layout of the content in terms of where it is visible its audio level whether it should be muted or not whether it should be paused or removed temporarily are in the control of the person sharing the content similar to the management and control by a moderator to a video conference as discussed above. Such an approach provides a compelling and novel way to watch live events among groups of people whose locations are geographically distributed yet want to experience an event together. This enables a whole new set of applications around active remote participation in live professional events such as conferences and social events such as weddings.

In some embodiments application server enables multiple views and device independent control by the participants to the video conference. Here the video endpoints each have its own user interface and in the case of hardware video systems available in conference rooms the video conference endpoints may each have a remote control that is not very easy to use. In order to make the user experience of connecting to the VMR simple user experience engine minimizes the operations that one need to carry out using the endpoints native interface and moves all of those functions to a set of interfaces running on a device familiar to most users desktop PC laptop PC mobile phone or mobile tablet and thus makes the user experience to control the VMR mostly independent of the endpoint devices user interface capabilities. With such device independent control of the video conference application server provides flexibility ease of use richness of experience and feature expansion that it allows to make the experience far more personal and meaningful to participants.

In some embodiments application server may also allow a participant to participate in and or control a video conference using multiple devices video conference endpoints simultaneously. On one device such as the video conference room system the participant can receive audio and video streams. On another device such as a laptop or tablet the same participant can send receive presentation materials chat messages etc. and also use it to control the conference such as muting one or more of the participants changing the layout on the screens of the video conference endpoints with PIP for the presentation etc. The actions on the laptop are reflected on the video conference room system since both are connected to the same VMR hosting the video conference.

Joining a video conference from H.323 endpoints today often involve cumbersome steps which must be performed via a remote control for the endpoint device. In addition to logistical issues such as locating the remote in a room there are learning curve related issues such as finding the correct number to call from the directory entering a specified code for the call from the remote etc. In some embodiments an endpoint can be setup to always just dial one number when it is turned on or woken up from sleep. Once the call is established then a different user interface such as a web application or mobile device client application can be used to select which meeting to join.

In some embodiments application server provides a user experience with a user interface rendering to the participants welcome screen content that includes but is not limited to the following an interactive welcome handshake a splash screen interactions for entering room number related info and a welcome video etc. for video conferences. To join a call from a video conference endpoint all that the moderator needs to do is to call a personal VMR number he she subscribes to. The moderator can then setup details for the call including the rich media content that would form part of the welcome handshake with other participants which may then be setup as default options for all calls hosted by the moderator. Other participants call into the VMR and enter the room number specified for the conference call. On joining the VMR they first enjoy the rich media content setup as their welcome screen including content specific to the call such as an agenda names of the parties calling in company related statistics etc. Such content could also be more generic for non business applications including any flash content including videos music animations advertisements etc. Upon joining the call the display also may show a code that is specific to the participant on his her screen which can be applied to the content on the call for content sharing. The code can also be entered from a web application used for the call or can be provided through voice or visual commands that are recognized and processed by software in the internet cloud that are then translated into actionable events.

As depicted in system of eight endpoints may be communicatively coupled to three encoders . While eight endpoints and three encoders have been depicted any number of endpoints and encoders may be present in system so long as the number of endpoints is greater than the number of encoders. Encoders may be located on server or more generally on one or more servers . Each endpoint may be communicatively coupled to an encoder via a network not depicted .

In one embodiment of the present invention the number of working points may be determined statistically in accordance with the capabilities of the endpoints. Such determination is described below in association with .

As depicted in flowchart of server may for each endpoint of the video conference system determine an operating point step particularly an operating point comprising the bandwidth and resolution associated with the endpoint. Further details for such determination are provided in . Based on i the operating point for each endpoint and ii a granularity parameter the server may determine the number and type of working points step . Further details for such determination are provided in . Finally the server may create an encoder for each working point step .

At step e.g. at any time during a video conference call the endpoint may update its capabilities e.g. based on its own logic . Such updating of capabilities may be accomplished in various ways depending on the protocol used. In SIP Re INVITE may be employed to update the endpoint capabilities in H.323 a new terminal capabilities message may be employed to update the endpoint capabilities and in other protocols different types of flow control messages may be employed.

At step the bandwidth of the connection between the endpoint and server may be determined. For example a bandwidth estimation algorithm based on TCP Friendly Rate Control TFRC or a loss based algorithm may be implemented by the server to estimate the bandwidth for a connection to a particular endpoint.

At step the resolution for an endpoint may be determined. For example a server may refer to a mapping from bandwidth to resolution e.g. in the form of a table in order to determine the resolution for an endpoint. An example mapping has been displayed in for ease of explanation. The resolution determination may further take into account the negotiated range of capabilities as determined in step . For instance such determination may consider the maximum negotiated resolution as depicted in . If a resolution for a particular bandwidth e.g. determined via the mapping exceeds the maximum negotiated resolution the determined resolution may be the maximum negotiated resolution as depicted in . Flowchart of concludes once an operating point for a particular endpoint has been determined.

Assuming a correspondence between endpoint and operating point and operating point etc. endpoint will be assigned the encoder associated with working point endpoint will be assigned the encoder associated with working point endpoint will be assigned the encoder associated with working point endpoint will be assigned the encoder associated with working point endpoint will be assigned the encoder associated with working point endpoint will be assigned the encoder associated with working point and endpoints and will be assigned the encoder associated with working point

The determination of working points in has been performed for a certain granularity setting i.e. a set increment for bandwidth and a set increment for resolution . depicts plot with a different granularity setting than . The eight operating points in are identical to those of . However the different granularity setting of results in four working points and accordingly the creation of four encoders. Operating points and results in the selection of working point operating points and results in the selection of working point operating point results in the selection of working point and operating points and result in the selection of working point

Based on the granularity setting of endpoints and will be assigned the encoder associated with working point endpoints and will be assigned the encoder associated with working point endpoint will be assigned the encoder associated with working point endpoints will be assigned the encoder associated with working point and endpoints and will be assigned the encoder associated with working point

The number of encoders created is on average always lower than having one encoder per endpoint and can be reduced considerably by limiting the number of supported resolutions and increasing the granularity of the bandwidth i.e. using larger increments as illustrated in .

One will observe that changing the capabilities of an endpoint may alter the number of working points. In one extreme case all endpoints need a different working point so there is one encoder per endpoint i.e. each operating point falls within it own grid in . In the other extreme case all endpoints have the same capabilities so there is only one working point and hence one encoder for all endpoints i.e. all operating points fall within one grid in .

In one embodiment of the invention a set of encoders may work in conjunction with one another and there may be several ways to optimize the processing performed between the encoders. In one algorithm each frame of a video data stream is encoded in the following manner. The working points are sorted by resolution lowest resolution first. For each resolution the working points are sorted by bandwidth lowest bandwidth first. Using the working points of as an example the working points would be sorted as and . Each working point has an associated encoder. First scene change detection is run once for all encoders. The first macroblock MB of the frame is encoded by the encoder with the lowest working point. The next encoder i.e. with the next lowest working point takes the result of the previous encoder. For mode decision the next encoder uses the result of the previous encoder. In the case of inter frame encoding the encoder will start the motion estimation and mode decision search with the MB partitioning and motion vector of the previous encoder for the search partitioning and motion vectors might have to be scaled appropriately if the encoder has a higher resolution than the previous encoder . This process repeats for each encoder for each MB of a frame and for each frame.

In another embodiment it is possible to completely reuse the motion estimation performed by the encoder of the working point immediately preceding the current working point in order to provide even more CPU optimization at the cost of some quality.

In the foregoing description certain flow diagrams have been shown and processes described in relation to those flow diagrams that provide a reference for discussion purposes. In an actual implementation of the methods of the present invention the steps can comprise event driven routines that can run in parallel and can be launched and executed other than as shown by the simple depiction in the flow diagrams. In short the particular order of the steps in the flow diagrams is illustrative of the invention but not limiting of the various permutations that can be achieved in a given embodiment.

Computer system includes a bus or other communication mechanism for communicating information and a processor coupled with the bus for processing information. Computer system also includes a main memory such as a random access memory RAM or other dynamic storage device coupled to the bus for storing information and instructions to be executed by the processor. Main memory also may be used for storing temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions to be executed by processor . Computer system may further include a read only memory ROM or other static storage device coupled to the bus for storing static information and instructions for the processor . A storage device which may be one or more of a hard disk flash memory based storage medium or other storage medium may be provided and coupled to the bus for storing information and instructions e.g. operating systems applications programs and the like .

Computer system may be coupled via the bus to a display such as a liquid crystal or light emitting diode display for displaying information to a user. An input device such as a keyboard including alphanumeric and other keys may be coupled to the bus for communicating information and command selections to the processor. In some embodiments the keyboard will be a software construct rendered via a touch screen display . Another type of user input device is cursor control device such as a mouse a trackball cursor direction keys and or any other input device for communicating direction information and command selections to processor and for controlling cursor movement on the display. Where a touch screen display is used cursor control functions may be implemented using finger based gestures directly on the display. Other user interface devices such as microphones speakers etc. are not shown in detail but may be involved with the receipt of user input and or presentation of output.

The processes referred to herein may be implemented by processor executing appropriate sequences of computer readable instructions contained in main memory . Such instructions may be read into main memory from another computer readable medium such as storage device and execution of the sequences of instructions contained in the main memory may cause the processor to perform the associated actions. In alternative embodiments hard wired circuitry or firmware controlled processing units e.g. field programmable gate arrays may be used in place of or in combination with processor and its associated computer software instructions to implement the invention. The computer readable instructions may be rendered in any computer language including without limitation C C C assembly language markup languages e.g. HTML SGML XML VoXML JavaScript and the like as well as object oriented environments such as the Common Object Request Broker Architecture CORBA Java and the like. In general the flow diagrams are intended to be illustrative of logical steps performed in a sequence to accomplish a given purpose which is the hallmark of any computer executable application. Unless specifically stated otherwise it should be appreciated that throughout the description of the present invention use of terms such as processing computing calculating determining displaying or the like refer to the action and processes of an appropriately programmed computer system such as computer system or similar electronic computing device that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical electronic quantities within its registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within its memories or registers or other such information storage transmission or display devices.

Computer system may also include a communication interface coupled to the bus . Communication interface may provide a two way data communication channel with a computer network such as a network which provides connectivity to and among the various servers and or client devices discussed above. For example communication interface may be a local area network LAN card wired and or wireless to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN which itself is communicatively coupled to the Internet through one or more Internet service provider networks.
