title: Battery testing system and method
abstract: A battery testing system includes a battery test module configured to couple to a battery. The battery test module is further configured to measure battery parameters and transmit the measured battery parameters. The battery testing system also includes a portable tablet device configured to receive the transmitted measured battery parameters. The portable tablet device is further configured to determine a battery test result from the measured battery parameters and display the battery test result.

The present application is based on and claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61 824 056 filed May 16 2013 the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present embodiments relate to battery testing systems and methods of the type used to test storage batteries.

Battery testers test storage batteries to determine various conditions of a battery. For example battery testers can be useful to determine the amount of charge a storage battery can hold i.e. capacity of the battery or the state of health of a storage battery.

Storage batteries are used in various applications including remote cellular stations electrical switching stations hospitals and many other installations requiring a source of backup power. Another example of an application for storage batteries is automotive vehicles both electrical vehicles and vehicles with internal combustion engines.

Many battery testing techniques have been developed through the years. Midtronics Inc. of Willowbrook Ill. and Dr. Keith S. Champlin have been pioneers in battery testing and related technologies. Examples of their work are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3 873 911 issued Mar. 25 1975 to Champlin U.S. Pat. No. 3 909 708 issued Sep. 30 1975 to Champlin U.S. Pat.
