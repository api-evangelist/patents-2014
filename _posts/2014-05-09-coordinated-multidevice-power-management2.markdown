Embodiments described herein generally relate to coordinating power management across multiple devices and more particularly relate to eliminating component redundancy across the devices to reduce total power consumption.

In computing devices power management is an important feature that can provide advantages such as increased battery life reduced energy consumption and reduced operating costs. In particular power management may be important in mobile devices such as smartphones tablets or ultrabooks or the like running on battery power. In some implementations computing devices may manage their power by turning off unused components. For example a device may only activate a global positioning system GPS component when running an application that requires location information. Once the GPS location has been determined the GPS component e.g. a GPS receiver may be turned off while the device is stationary. Computing devices may also manager their power by entering low or lower power states e.g. sleep states or the like during periods of inactivity.

As devices continue to become more mobile and more reliant on battery power and as users become more concerned with using less power techniques that provide for enhanced power management may be desirable.

As described above it may be advantageous to provide power management for devices in various implementations. As discussed power management may provide advantages such as increased battery life reduced energy consumption and reduced operating costs and power management may be particularly important in mobile devices such as smartphones tablets laptop computers ultrabooks or the like running on battery power.

In some embodiments providing power management across multiple devices may include establishing one or more communicative couplings between the devices. For example a communicative coupling may include a peer to peer communication channel established after a pairing of devices. One or more of the devices may inventory the components of each device of the multiple devices and generate a power management plan for the multiple devices. For example the components may include sensors such as global positioning system GPS receivers communications radios e.g. Wi Fi radios third generation mobile telecommunications 3G radios various sensors or the like. In an embodiment each device of the multiple devices may inventory the components and generate a power management plan using the same techniques such that the same power management plan is generated at each device . In another embodiment a single device of the multiple devices may inventory the components generate the power management plan and communicate the power management plan to the other devices. The devices may then implement the power management plan to eliminate redundant components or the like to reduce the total power consumed by the multiple devices. For example if a component at a first device and a component at a second device have a redundancy e.g. perform the same or similar function one of the devices may shut down their respective component to reduce power usage and the device may map to the component of the second device such that applications on the device may retain the functionality of the shut down component. In another example one device of the multiple devices may enter a lower power state or the like based on the power management plan.

In an embodiment device or any of devices may inventory components and or resources of devices . For example the components of devices may include modules or circuitry or the like that provide functionality for the device and that may be shut down or entered into a lower power state to reduce power consumption across system . For example components may include GPS receivers sensors communications radios processing resources displays or the like. Resources of devices may include other characteristics of the device pertinent to the generation of a power usage plan such as for example applications associated with the components whether the applications are actively running battery power level or remaining battery life of the device efficiency of the device in accomplishing various tasks e.g. power used time needed or the like for a task or tasks power efficiency associated with a component or a device type e.g. ultrabook or smartphone or the like . For example such resources of devices may be pertinent to saving power e.g. usage may be diverted to device having a greater remaining battery life a more efficient device may be used for a task etc. or increasing a user experience in implementing the power management plan.

Based on the inventory of components and or resources of devices one or more of devices may generate a power management plan based on the inventory of components and or resources. For example the power management plan may eliminate a redundancy and reduce the total power consumed by the devices of system . Reducing the total power consumed by the devices of system may include reducing power based on the eliminated redundancy and or placing a device into a lower power state. Furthermore reducing the total power consumed may include redirecting component usage to devices having greater remaining power more efficiency a better user experience or the like.

In one example a user may be travelling with a smartphone e.g. device a tablet e.g. device and an ultrabook e.g. device . In such an example device and device may each include a GPS receiver. Furthermore a variety of applications e.g. map applications review service applications social networking applications camera applications or the like available and or running on device and device may use location information received by invoking their respective GPS receivers.

In such an example one or more of devices may establish communicative couplings and or and inventory components and or resources of devices . Based on the inventory one or more of devices may generate a power management plan for devices and devices may implement the power management plan. Continuing the example the inventory may identify a GPS receiver of device and a GPS receiver of device which may be redundant within system . The power management plan may select one of the GPS receivers for use within system and the other GPS receiver may be shut down or disabled to reduce the total power consumed by system . For example the GPS receiver of device may be selected based on device having more remaining battery power or a more efficient GPS receiver or the like. By implementing the power management plan the GPS receiver of device and of device if available may be shut down and any location information for system may be provided via the GPS receiver of device . For example applications running on device that need location information may obtain the location information via the GPS receiver of device through a component mapping via communicative coupling .

In another example a user may be at their personal computer laptop or ultrabook e.g. device which may be wall powered or plugged in e.g. on AC power and may be running a variety of applications. Furthermore the user may have a smartphone e.g. device . For example both device and device may be running an email application which may be fetching emails from a server over a wireless communications channel such as a Wi Fi channel or the like.

In such an example one or more of devices may establish communicative couplings and or and inventory components and or resources of devices as described and based on the inventory one or more of devices may generate and implement a power management plan for devices . Continuing the example the inventory may identify a communications radio of device and a communications radio of device which may be redundant within system . In this example the redundancy may be a redundancy of functionality e.g. communications and as in other embodiments discussed herein the redundancy need not be provided by identical or nearly identical components. For example the redundancy may include device being on Wi Fi or coupled to a wired Ethernet network and device being on a 3G or LTE wireless or the like. In any event the power management plan may select one of the communications connections for use within system and the other communications connection may be shut down disabled or idled or the like to reduce the total power consumed by system . For example the communications connection of device may be selected based on device being plugged in having more remaining battery power a communications connection with a wider bandwidth or a lower user fee or the like. By implementing the power management plan the communications connection of device and of device if applicable may be shut down disabled or idle and any communications connection for system may be provided via the communications connection of device .

Alternatively or in addition device itself may be put into a lower power state e.g. standby or sleep mode or the like based in part on the power management plan. For example if all components of device are unused based on using a component of device e.g. the communications connection as discussed and or based on no applications of device invoking the various components of device e.g. no GPS receiver is being used as the user is not moving no processing resources are being utilized and so on then device may enter a lower power state. Device may be entered into the lower power state based on the power management explicitly directing device to enter the lower power state or device may enter itself into the lower power state based on its components being disabled. For example device may determine it is idle and may enter into the lower power state based on that determination.

In another example a user may be on a piece of exercise equipment such as an exercise bike or the like. The piece of exercise equipment may be wall powered or plugged in and may include a sensor such as a heart rate monitor. Furthermore the user may have a watch that also has a heart rate monitor. In such an example the piece of exercise equipment and the watch may establish a communicative coupling and inventory components and or resources of the piece of exercise equipment and the watch as described and based on the inventory one or both may generate and implement a power management plan. For example the inventory may identify the heart rate monitors as redundant. The power management plan may select one of the heart rate monitors for use and the other heart rate monitor may be shut down disabled or idled or the like to reduce the total power consumed. For example the heart rate monitor selected for use may be selected based on the piece of exercise equipment being plugged in based on the selected heart rate monitor s accuracy or the like.

In some examples one or more of devices may be wall powered or plugged in e.g. AC powered . Furthermore in some examples if one or more of devices becomes AC powered it may auto select itself first e.g. for use of local components as is discussed further herein even if another device is also AC powered. In other examples if the device becomes AC powered it may still offload to another AC powered device if that device has additional capabilities e.g. a larger bandwidth communications capability or more efficient capabilities.

Returning to as shown one or more communicative couplings may be established among devices . For example communicative coupling may be established between device and communicative coupling may be established between device and and communicative coupling may be established between device and . In some examples each of devices may inventory the components and or resources of devices and each may generate a power management plan based on the inventory. In such examples communicative couplings may all be needed as each of devices needs to communicate with the other devices of system to generate the inventory.

In other examples one or only some devices of system may inventory the components and or resources of devices . In such examples not all of devices may need to communicate with each other. For example if device is selected to inventory the components and or resources of devices then communicative coupling and communicative coupling may be established while communicative coupling may not be needed. For example device may inventory the components and or resources of devices via communicative couplings and transmit the inventory list to devices via communicative coupling .

Similarly in some examples one or only some of devices may generate a power management plan. Again in such examples not all of communicative couplings may be needed. For example if device is selected to generate and communicate the power management plan then communicative coupling and communicative coupling may be established while communicative coupling may not be needed. For example device may generate the power management plan and transmit it to devices via communicative coupling .

Communicative couplings may include any communicative coupling that may provide communications between two or more of devices . For example communicative couplings may include a peer to peer communications channel a local area network a personal area network a body area network or the like. As shown devices may communicate wirelessly however some devices of system may communicate over a wired network such as an Ethernet network or a wired connection such as universal serial bus USB connection or the like. Furthermore communicative couplings may include any suitable communications techniques and or protocols including wireless communications protocols such as Bluetooth Infrared Data Association Wi Fi e.g. wireless local networking based on the Institute of Electronics Engineers IEEE 802.11 standards body area networking based on IEEE standard 802.15.6 or the like.

In some examples the establishment of communicative couplings may be in response to a trigger e.g. a trigger to provide multi device power management at one or more of devices devices entering an active power state and devices enabling device to device communications. For example the device to device communications may include the devices being discoverable and a discovery process or protocol such as zero configuration networking zeroconf or universal plug and play UPnP or the like being implemented. For example establishing communicative couplings may include a pairing or enrollment process to establish devices belong to the same user s or same pool of devices or the like.

As discussed one or more communicative couplings may be established between devices . Also as discussed one or more of devices may inventory components and or resources of devices and one or more of devices may generated and or implement a power management plan based on the inventory of components and or resources. For example the power management plan may be implemented at a local device and remote devices simultaneously.

Devices are illustrated with the described components for the sake of clarity of presentation however devices may include any components as discussed herein in any combination such that a redundancy of functionality may be determined across system . For example devices may include any combination of GPS receivers sensors wireless communications radios processing resources displays or any other component s discussed herein. Such components may be inventoried as discussed and or resources or characteristics of devices may be inventoried for utilization in generating a power management plan as is discussed further below.

As shown in process may begin at start operation Start where the power management techniques as discussed herein may begin. For example power management settings may be enabled or activated e.g. as a factory setting software setting or user selected setting within one or more of devices . In various examples process may be performed by one device or multiple devices in concert. Further the operations of process may be performed in parallel in series or a combination thereof.

Processing may continue at decision operation Multi Device Power Management Trigger where a determination of whether a multi device power management trigger has occurred may be made by one or more of devices . As shown if no trigger is detected process may return to decision operation . If a trigger is detected process may continue at operation as is discussed further below. The multi device power management trigger or power management trigger may be any suitable trigger that indicates a multi device power management evaluation may be advantageous. For example the multi device power management trigger may be a periodic trigger occurring at regular intervals or the like. The periodic trigger may have any period such as for example five minutes ten minutes twenty minutes one hour or the like. In an example the periodic trigger interval may be user defined. In another example the periodic trigger may vary based on an activity state of the device e.g. a more active device may have a more frequent periodic trigger components or software running on the device or the like.

In another example the power management trigger may be a user initiated trigger. For example one or more of devices may provide a user selection option or button or the like that may allow a user to select a power management mode or multi device power management mode or trigger or the like. Such a selection may be advantageous to a user seeking to save power or a user with a device that is running low on battery power for example.

In yet another example the power management trigger may be a device change or a change in status trigger. For example a device change or change in status trigger may include a device entering or exiting system or a change in the resources of one or more device such as for example a device meeting a low battery power status e.g. half power or 20 power remaining or the like a device running a predefined component or number of components or the like.

In some examples the power management trigger available at a device may depend on the device capability or platform of the device. For example some devices include power management platforms that may include or indicate power states or component statuses that may be used to generate power management triggers. In such instances change in status triggers based on device characteristics may be available for example. In other examples some devices may include low energy communications platforms e.g. Bluetooth or the like that may detect other devices. In such instances change in status triggers based on other devices entering or exiting the system may be available. However other devices may not include such platforms and for example may only enable periodic triggers and or user defined triggers.

In such examples the operations of process may be initiated at various devices based on their enabled or allowed triggers and the operations may be performed by two devices in concert while for example a third and fourth devices are not yet triggered. In such an example a power management plan based on the two available devices may be generated and implemented. At subsequent iterations of the operations of process additional devices may be added to the power management plan as they become triggered and or available. In an embodiment such trigger availability may be added to the resources inventory as discussed herein and incorporated into the power management plan to optimize the number of available devices the reduction of redundancy and the reduction of power consumption as discussed herein. For example an interval or timing may be set by the power management plan when all devices will be available for communication simultaneously.

Processing may continue at operation Enter Active Power State where one or more of devices may enter an active power state. For example one or more of devices may enter an active power state from a lower power state such as a standby mode or a sleep mode or the like. In an example entering an active power state may include one or more of the components of the device e.g. device to device communications components entering an active power state. In an example entering an active power state may be substantially unnoticeable to a user. In an example entering an active power state may include waking the device.

Processing may continue at operation Enable Device to Device Communication where one or more of devices may enable device to device communication. For example enabling device to device communications may include enabling a communications radio if previously disabled making the device discoverable and or initiating a discovery process or protocol.

Processing may continue at operation Identify and Connect to Available Device s where one or more of devices may establish one or more of communicative couplings as discussed herein. In some examples each device may be communicatively coupled to every other device of system . In other examples one or some of the devices may be communicatively coupled such that one or some of the devices may generate an inventory and or power management plan and provide the inventory and or power management plan to the communicatively coupled device such that every device in the system generates or obtains the inventory and or power management plan. For example at operation one or more of devices may identify and or connect to a set of user devices or a shared pool of devices or the like.

Processing may continue at operation Inventory Device Component s where one or more of devices may inventory the components of devices as discussed herein. For example the components may include modules or circuitry or the like that provide functionality for the respective device as discussed herein. Furthermore a portion of the components may be available for shut down or a lower power state to reduce power consumption. As discussed example components include GPS receivers sensors wireless communications radios processing resources and displays although other components may be available and inventoried.

Processing may continue at operation Identify Applications Using Component s where one or more of devices may identify and or inventory the applications of devices that are associated with the components e.g. that may use the components and or applications that are actively using the components. In an example the applications may be considered resources of the devices as discussed herein. In other examples the applications may be inventoried separately with respect to other device resources. The applications may be identified via devices and communicated among devices via communicative couplings in any manner as discussed herein.

Processing may continue at operation Determine Device Resources where one or more of devices may determine and or inventory the resources of devices . As discussed resources may include characteristics of the device pertinent to the generation of a power usage plan such as for example remaining battery power or remaining battery duration of the device efficiency of the device in accomplishing various tasks e.g. power used time needed or the like for a task or tasks power efficiency associated with a component or a device type e.g. ultrabook or smartphone or the like . In some examples a weighting may be applied to the various resources such that their importance may be determined and factored into the power management plan. In an embodiment a primary resource of devices for the generation of the power management plan is the available battery power of the device.

Processing may continue at operation Generate Power Management Plan where one or more of devices may generate a power management plan. As discussed in some examples each of devices may generate the power management plan. In such examples each device may generate the power management plan based on a distributed resource planning technique that may be performed by any of devices . For example the distributed resource planning technique may be performed in the same manner on each device and on the same inventory on each device to generate the same resultant power management plan. Using such a distributed resource planning technique devices may be orchestrated or synchronized to generate and implement the same power management plan to provide an optimal result for system .

In other examples one or some of devices may generate the power management plan and the resultant power management plan may be communicated or transmitted to those devices that did not generate the power management plan. In examples where more than one device generates the power management plan a distributed resource planning technique e.g. each of those devices using the same technique on the same information to produce the same resultant power management plan may be used . Using such techniques some devices may not need to generate the resultant power management plan e.g. due to a lack of communicative coupling very low power resources or the like while conformity of the power management plan may still be ensured.

In examples where one device generates the power management plan and distributes the power management plan to all other devices of system a centralized resource planning technique may be used such that one device inventories the components and or resources generates the power management plan and transmits the power management plan to other devices. For example such techniques may be advantageous when communicative couplings are limited to being through just one device when only one device has the platform or capability to generated a power management plan when only one device has an updated power management plan generation revision or the like. In an embodiment a centralized resource planning technique may be implemented via a central planner device of system . In some examples where a centralized resource planning technique is used the technique s used to generate the power management plan may be the same as those used in distributed resource planning technique s and in other examples the techniques may be different.

Generating the power management plan may include any technique or techniques that provide for eliminating redundancies in the functionality of components and or for providing components usage models that reduce total power consumed by system . In some examples the power management plan may also move power usage to one or more devices with a greater power level a longer duration until battery failure more efficiency in completing tasks associated with a particular component or the like.

As discussed herein eliminating a redundancy may include eliminating any redundant functionality of components and a redundancy does not require an exact or even a substantially exact duplication of components. For example a redundancy may be provided by two components that provide device location two components that provide GPS data or two components that are the same GPS circuitry. In any event a redundancy may exist and such examples illustrate that as used herein a redundancy is associated with a redundant functionality being duplicated with respect to system . For example a redundancy may be provided by heterogeneous components. The discussed redundancies may be determined in any suitable manner. For example the inventory of components may include for each component a model name a model identifier a serial number a part number a manufacturer a version number a chip or chipset identifier number a functionality descriptor or any other identifier associated with the component such that components may be compared for a redundancy. For example generating the power management plan may include categorizing and or comparing the components for a redundancy. In some examples a user may define one or more components that are available for shut down or those that are not available for shut down or a mode of power management such as aggressive moderate or none or the like. The generation of the power management plan may account for such user selections by for example broadening or narrowing the criteria for a redundancy keeping certain components unavailable for shut down or the like.

Any redundancy may be exploited for reduced power consumption. With reference to for example a redundancy may be provided between GPS receiver of device and GPS receiver of device . Such a redundancy may be associated with a component that provides information for use by the device e.g. as a sensor . In other examples the redundancy may be provided by two components that provide communications for device. For example the redundancy may be between a wired connection and a wireless connection two Wi Fi radios a Wi Fi radio and a 3G radio a 3G radio and an LTE radio two LTE radios and so on with any combination of communications components able to provide a redundancy within system . With continued reference to a redundancy may be provided among any two or more of wireless radio which may be a Wi Fi radio wired communications port which may be an Ethernet port wireless radio which may be a Wi Fi radio wireless radio which may be a 3G radio wireless radio which may be a Wi Fi radio and or wireless radio which may be an LTE radio. In various examples the power management plan may shut down idle or move to a lower power state one or more of wireless radio wired communications port wireless radio wireless radio wireless radio and or wireless radio . In an embodiment a single communications connection may be used. For example a communications connection having a widest bandwidth may be kept active or in a higher power state while others may be shut down or the like. In another embodiment multiple communications connections may be used such that all applications requiring communications are serviced. For example some applications may not be able to use all communications connections and the power management plan may take such limitations into account.

In yet other examples the redundancy may be provided by processing resources. For example one or more devices may be used for processing and components of other devices may be shut down or idled or moved to a lower power state e.g. some cores of a multi core processor may be shut down or idled or the like. With continued reference to a redundancy may be provided by two or more of processor which may be a multi core processor processor and or processor . As discussed the power management plan may shut down or the like one or more of processor processor or processor . For example a processor having a greatest processing power may be kept active or in a higher power state while others may be shut down or the like.

In still further examples the redundancy may be provided by components such as sensors displays or speakers or the like. For example data or information from one device may be presented to a user via an active display of another device while a display of the first device is kept idle or is shut down. Similarly in other examples data or information from one device may be presented to a user via a speaker a headset or the like via an active component of another device while a redundant component of the first device is kept idle or is shut down. In other examples sensors such as microphones accelerometers heart rate monitors or gyroscopes or the like may provide the redundancy. As discussed in such examples the sensor may be activated on one device while disabled or shut down on another device while the device having the shut down component may use the active device component to receive data or signals or the like.

In some examples the power management plan may eliminate the redundancy by disabling one or more of the redundant components. In an embodiment the power management plan includes a protocol to alternate the component being shut down between one device and another device such that the burden of running the component may be shared over time. For example at one device the power management plan may alternate a component between a shut down state and an in use state over time. Such duty cycling may provide longer overall duration for each device involved in the alternating usage plan. In the in use state the device may allow access from another device or devices to the in use component and in the shut down state the device may map applications to an in use component at a remote device. The discussed alternating may be implemented in any suitable manner that shares component resources across system and provides for lower power usage. For example the alternating may be periodic such that after a duration the in use component switches between one or more devices. The duration may be any suitable duration such as for example five minutes fifteen minutes or a half hour or the like. In some examples the duration may be different for different devices based on the device types efficiencies of the components across devices remaining battery life of the devices or the like.

Processing may continue at operation Activate Deactivate Local Components where one or more of devices may activate or deactivate local components of the device based on the power management plan. For example a local component may be a component integral to the device or attached to and under control of the device. As discussed the power management plan may indicate which components of devices across system may remain activate or may be activated and which components may be shut down or idled or the like to reduce the power consumption of system .

Processing may continue at operation Map Component Application Programming Interfaces APIs to Local or Remote Components where one or more of devices may map component APIs to local or remote components. As discussed device for example of system may shut down a local component and may use a component of device for example of system to eliminate a redundancy and reduce the total power consumed by system . In such examples it may be necessary to map the API of device to the component of device e.g. a remote component . Further the API of device may map to the component of device e.g. a local component . Although discussed with respect to an API mapping any suitable mapping may be provided. Furthermore the communication of data between or among devices may be provided by one or more of communicative couplings as discussed herein.

In some examples operation and operation may be provided for non communications components e.g. GPS receivers displays or sensors or the like . For example such non communications components may provide data that may be needed by multiple devices while communications components e.g. wireless radios and the like may be used at a single device e.g. a device the user is interacting with without the need for other devices to continue using their communications components. For example a non communication component such as an active GPS receiver of a device with a display off e.g. a phone in a pocket may be needed by a tablet device being viewed and interacted with by a user. In other instances a communications component such as a Wi Fi radio may be kept active for a device also with an active display that is being manipulated by a user to check email for example. In such an example no mapping may be required between devices as the inactive device component may be idled until a later time e.g. there is no need for the inactive device to also download the same email . Such communications component examples are continued with respect to operation below.

However in other examples communication connection components may also be mapped between devices e.g. via an API or the like . Such mapping s may provide flexibility among devices or increased power savings or the like.

Processing may continue at operation Activate Deactivate Communication Components s where one or more of devices may activate or deactivate communication component s based on the power management plan. For example redundant communication components may be shut down idled or disabled to reduce the total power consumed by system . As discussed redundant communication components may be communication components that provide the same functionality e.g. communication although they may include different protocols or standards or the like.

Processing may continue at operation Set Local Power State where one or more of devices may be set to a power state based on the power management plan. As discussed in some examples component s of one or more devices may be shut down or idled based on the power management plan. In other examples one or more device may be set to a different power state e.g. a higher or lower power state based on the power management plan. For example implementing the power management plan may include placing one or more of devices into a lower power state. The lower power state may include any suitable power state that may reduce the total power consumed by system . For example the lower powers state may include an away mode e.g. where a display is off but background tasks are running a power on suspend mode e.g. where power to the device processor and or random access memory is maintained but other components are powered off a processor power off mode a standby or sleep mode e.g. where the processor is powered off and RAM remains powered a hibernation mode e.g. where the processor is powered off and main memory is saved to non volatile memory and powered down or the like.

In various examples one or more of operations or may be skipped or not applicable in an iteration of process . For example in some iterations no changes may be made in some iterations only non communication components may be disabled in some iterations only communication components may be disabled in some iterations local power states of various devices may be modified and in some iterations combinations thereof may be implemented.

As shown process may continue at decision operation where processing may continue or repeat as discussed above. The operations of process may be repeated any number of times either in series or in parallel at various devices of system to reduce the total power consumed by system . Process may be performed by any suitable device or devices that may support one or more of operations such as for example any of devices of system or any of platform device system or system as discussed herein.

As shown firmware may include a component routing module a device to device communications module a cross device planning module a presence detection module local component s and platform power state management module .
