The present application is a continuation application of International Application No. PCT US2012 051173 filed Aug. 16 2012 which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 525 532 filed Aug. 19 2011 and also claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 539 135 filed Sep. 26 2011 which are incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The present invention was developed using funding from the United States government through Department of Energy Grant No. DE AC02 05CH11231 and Department of Energy Grant No. DE SC005397. The United States government has certain rights to the invention.

The current invention relates to materials usable as anodes in batteries particularly lithium ion secondary rechargeable batteries. The invention also relates to anodes and batteries containing such materials. The invention further relates to methods of making the materials and anodes and batteries using such materials.

Batteries may be divided into two principal types primary batteries and secondary batteries. Primary batteries may be used once and are then exhausted. Secondary batteries are also often called rechargeable batteries because after use they may be connected to an electricity supply such as a wall socket and recharged and used again. In secondary batteries each charge discharge process is called a cycle. Secondary batteries eventually reach an end of their usable life but typically only after many charge discharge cycles.

Secondary batteries are made up of an electrochemical cell and optionally other materials such as a casing to protect the cell and wires or other connectors to allow the battery to interface with the outside world. An electrochemical cell includes two electrodes the positive electrode or cathode and the negative electrode or anode an insulator separating the electrodes so the battery does not short out and an electrolyte that chemically connects the electrodes.

In operation the secondary battery exchanges chemical energy and electrical energy. During discharge of the battery electrons which have a negative charge leave the anode and travel through outside electrical conductors such as wires in a cell phone or computer to the cathode. In the process of traveling through these outside electrical conductors the electrons generate an electrical current which provides electrical energy.

At the same time in order to keep the electrical charge of the anode and cathode neutral an ion having a positive charge leaves the anode and enters the electrolyte and a positive ion also leaves the electrolyte and enters the cathode. In order for this ion movement to work typically the same type of ion leaves the anode as enters the cathode. Additionally the electrolyte typically also contains this same type of ion. For instance in a lithium ion battery the ion that leaves the anode enters the cathode and is found in the electrolyte is a lithium ion Li .

In order to recharge the battery the same process happens in reverse. By supplying energy to the cell electrons are induced to leave the cathode and move into the anode. At the same time a positive ion such as Li leaves the cathode and enters the electrolyte and a Li leaves the electrolyte and enters the anode to keep the overall electrode charge neutral.

In addition to containing an active material that exchanges electrons and ions anodes and cathodes often contain other materials such as a metal backing to which a slurry is applied and dried. The slurry often contains the active material as well as a binder to help it adhere to the backing and conductive materials such as a carbon particles. Once the slurry dries it forms a coating on the metal backing.

Unless additional materials are specified batteries as described herein include systems that are merely be electrochemical cells as well as more complex systems.

In order for a battery to function properly the materials used in the anode cathode and electrolyte are typically selected to have compatible electrical chemical and electrochemical properties. For instance the materials may be selected to operate at compatible voltages. Many rechargeable lithium ion batteries use carbon typically in the form of graphite as the anode because of voltage compatibility. Graphite however suffers from a number of drawbacks.

First graphite anodes cause limits in battery properties. For instance they limit theoretical gravimetic capacity to 372 mAh g and theoretical volumetric capacity to 830 Ah L or practical volumetric capacity to around 350 Ah L meaning that a heavier and larger battery is required to supply sufficient energy for many applications. In some instances this does not cause serious problems but in others where for example it results in a much heavier and less efficient automobile or a heavier laptop computer it is a significant drawback.

Second the surface of the carbon anode is prone to unwanted chemical reactions with the electrolyte. This can lead to the formation of new chemicals which are deposited on the surface of the carbon anode in a solid electrolyte interfacial SEI layer. The SEI layer can impede lithium ion access to the anode and interfere with battery function.

Third because the charge discharge potential of carbon anodes in many lithium ion batteries is close to the potential at which Li converts from its ionic state back to a metal Li or Li Li metal often forms a deposit on the anode. This deposit like the SEI layer can impede lithium ion access to the anode. More importantly as the Li metal deposit grows with each charge discharge cycle it eventually extends from the anode over to the cathode. Li metal is conductive so when this occurs electrons can move from the anode to the cathode via the Li metal deposit instead of through the external electrical conductor. When this happens the battery short circuits and no longer provides power to the device containing the external electrical conductor. As a result the battery is no longer useful and must be discarded.

Graphite anodes also experience a fourth problem when used with cathodes containing manganese such as manganese oxide spinels. In such batteries manganese slowly leaches from the cathode and enters the electrolyte where it eventually makes its way to the anode. Once there it reacts with the anode in very unfavorable manners that eventually poison the anode and destroy its ability to participate in the battery s electrochemical reactions. At this point the battery is no longer useful and also must be discarded. This problem associated with carbon anodes has long hampered the development of lithium ion batteries with manganese based cathodes many of which are otherwise useful materials.

To address these drawbacks many alternative anode materials have been explored. For instance anodes using various metals have been created and tested. Many of these metal based anodes overcome one or more of the drawbacks associated with carbon anodes but unfortunately metal based anodes often suffer from different drawbacks that similarly render them non ideal or otherwise incompatible with useful electrolytes or cathodes. For instance antimony Sb based anodes exhibit improved gravimetric and volumetric capacity but tend to fail or exhibit large capacity fade after a relatively low number of cycles. This failure results from physical degradation of the anode because particles of the anode material found in the coating portion of the electrode change volume substantially between their charged and discharged states. As a result these particles become physically detached from other coating materials such as conductive particles and otherwise degrade the coating resulting in a decrease in anode function and occasionally eventual anode failure.

Embodiments of the current invention described in this disclosure overcome one or more drawbacks associated with carbon and previous metal anodes or are otherwise suitable anode materials for use in a lithium ion battery.

In one embodiment the current invention relates to an anode material with the general formula MSb M O C where M is selected from the group consisting of copper Cu molybdenum Mo nickel Ni titanium Ti or tin Sn and combinations thereof M is selected from the group consisting of aluminum Al magnesium Mg titanium Ti vanadium V chromium Cr manganese Mn iron Fe cobalt Co nickel Ni zirconium Zr molybdenum Mo tungsten W niobium Nb or tantalum Ta and combinations thereof and M O C forms a matrix containing MSb.

According to another embodiment the invention relates to an anode material with the general formula MSn M C C where M is selected from the group consisting of copper Cu molybdenum Mo nickel Ni titanium Ti zinc Zn or antimony Sb and combinations thereof M is selected from the group consisting of titanium Ti vanadium V chromium Cr iron Fe cobalt Co nickel Ni molybdenum Mo tungsten W or silicon Si and combinations thereof and M C C forms a matrix containing MSn.

According to a third embodiment the invention relates to an anode material with the general formula MoSb C where C forms a matrix containing MoSb.

According to a fourth embodiment the invention relates to an anode material with the general formula MSb M C C where M may be an electrochemically active metal and M may be another metal and where M C C forms a matrix containing MSb.

Other embodiments relate to anodes or rechargeable batteries containing these materials as well as methods of making these materials using ball milling techniques.

In the general formulas used herein hyphens indicate chemical compositions that are intermingled to form a composite material. Chemical bonds may or may not be present between these components of a composite material.

The current disclosure relates to four general types of anode materials anodes and batteries containing such materials and methods of making these materials. Although the anode materials are typically described herein in their delithiated forms when used in a rechargeable lithium ion battery they will additionally contain lithium ions Li in amounts that will vary as the battery cycles through its charged and discharged states. The number of Li that may be in any general chemical formula will depend on the number of elections gained by the anode material when that battery is in a fully charged state as compared to a fully discharged state.

The first type of anode material has the general formula MSb M O C where M may be a metal such as copper Cu molybdenum Mo nickel Ni titanium Ti or tin Sn or combination thereof or similar metals and combinations thereof and where M may be aluminum Al magnesium Mg titanium Ti vanadium V chromium Cr manganese Mn iron Fe cobalt Co nickel Ni zirconium Zr molybdenum Mo tungsten W niobium Nb or tantalum Ta or combinations thereof or similar metals and combinations thereof. In one specific embodiment the first type of anode material may have the general formula CuSb AlO C.

In specific embodiments the material may be present in the form of a nanocomposite material in which crystalline particles of CuSb are embedded in a matrix of the other materials. CuSb particles may have an average diameter or size of 500 nm or less 200 nm or less 100 nm or less or 50 nm or less. In particular they may have an average diameter of between 1 and 20 nm.

In an anode material with the general formula MSb M O C MSb particles provide electrochemical activity. These particles may be nanostructured. In the CuSb portion of the CuSb AlO C embodiment a conductive Cu framework supports the electrochemically active Sb. In other embodiments Mmay provide a similar conductive framework. M O which may also be referred to as a ceramic oxide may be amorphous or partially amorphous. The C portion forms a conductive carbon matrix with the M O. MSb is dispersed within this matrix.

In one embodiment the particulate nature of the MSb portion of the MSb M O C anode material may not develop until after the material has been cycled in an electrochemical cell. In some embodiments the particulate nature may not be present until the material has been cycled at least 50 or at least 100 times in an electrochemical cell. Prior to that time regions of crystallinity but not well defined particles may be observed.

Materials of the general formula MSb M O C may reduce or minimize the effects of changes in volume as lithium ions enter and leave the material by blending nanostructured materials that are electrochemically active towards lithium MSb with materials that are inactive towards lithium M Oand C to form composite anode materials. Although in some embodiments the nanostructured materials may offer shorter diffusion lengths for lithium ions and may accommodate the strain due to volume changes during battery cycling the large surface area to volume ratio resulting from the particles small size and the high surface reactivity of these nanostructured materials may be problematic. The addition of M O C to form an inactive matrix may help buffer the volume change in the electrochemically active material during charge discharge cycles. The M O C matrix may also reduce agglomeration of the MSb particles which is detrimental to battery performance.

Anode materials with the general formula MSb M O C typically operate at potentials sufficiently higher than the potential at which Li converts to Lito avoid plating of lithium metal on the anode or to reduce the rate of plating to a rate sufficiently low to avoid failure of the battery due to a short circuit during its expected lifetime. The operational potential may also prevent or reduce formation of an SEI layer.

Anode materials of general formula MSb M O C may be used in a battery with an expected lifetime of thousands of cycles for example at least 1000 cycles or at least 2000 cycles.

These anodes may exhibit a much higher gravimetric and volumetric capacities than a graphite anode. For instance they may have a gravimetric capacity of between 380 and 650 mAh g and a volumetric capacity of between 450 and 1 000 Ah L.

Such batteries may retain at least 70 of their gravimetric or volumetric capacity after a large number of cycles such a thousand or more cycles.

Anode materials with the general formula MSb M O C may have a high tap density of greater than 1 g cm.

Finally anode materials with the general formula MSb M O C may be resistant to poisoning by Mn contained in the cathode.

Anode materials with the general formula CuSb AlO C may be synthesized in some embodiments by mechanochemical reduction of SbOwith Al and Cu metals in the presence of carbon. The carbon may be from an elemental or polymeric carbon source. For instance it may be in the form of acetylene black or another similar material. In a specific embodiment the mechanochemical reduction may be carried out in a single one step high energy mechanical milling HEMM process which is a type of ball milling process. Similar methods may be used for other materials of the general formula MSb M O C.

The second type of anode material has the general formula MSn M C C where M may be a metal such as copper Cu molybdenum Mo nickel Ni titanium Ti zinc Zn or antimony Sb combinations thereof or similar metals and combinations thereof and where M may be titanium Ti vanadium V chromium Cr iron Fe cobalt Co nickel Ni molybdenum Mo tungsten W or silicon Si or combinations thereof or similar metals and combinations thereof. In one specific embodiment the second type of anode material may have the general formula CuSn TiC C.

In specific embodiments the material may be present in the form of a nanocomposite material. In particular it may contain particles of CuSn with an average diameter or size of 500 nm or less 200 nm or less 100 nm or less or 50 nm or less.

In an anode material with the general formula MSn M C C MSn particles provide electrochemical activity. These particles may be nanostructured. In the CuSn portion of the CuSn TiC C embodiment a conductive Cu framework supports the electrochemically active Sn. In other embodiments Mmay provide a similar conductive framework. M Cmay be amorphous or partially amorphous. The C portion forms a conductive carbon matrix with the M C. MSn is dispersed within this matrix.

Materials of the general formula MSb M O C may reduce or minimize the effects of changes in volume as lithium ions enter and leave the material by blending nanostructured materials that are electrochemically active towards lithium MSn with materials that are inactive towards lithium M Cand C to form composite anode materials. Although in some embodiments the nanostructured materials may offer shorter diffusion lengths for lithium ions and may accommodate the strain due to volume changes during battery cycling the large surface area to volume ratio resulting from the particles small size and the high surface reactivity of these nanostructured materials may be problematic. The addition of M C C to form an inactive matrix may help buffer the volume change in the electrochemically active material during charge discharge cycles. The M C C matrix may also reduce agglomeration of the MSb particles which is detrimental to battery performance.

Anode materials with the general formula MSn M C C typically operate at potentials that are sufficiently higher than the potential at which Li converts to Lito avoid plating of lithium metal on the anode or to reduce the rate of plating to a rate sufficiently low to avoid failure of the battery due to a short circuit during its expected lifetime. The operational potential may also prevent or reduce formation of an SEI layer.

Anode materials of general formula MSn M C C may be used in a battery with an expected lifetime of thousands of cycles for example at least 1000 cycles or at least 2000 cycles.

These anodes may exhibit volumetric capacity of at least 4 times higher than that of a graphite anode. For example such anodes may exhibit a second cycle discharge capacity of 1 000 mAh cm.

Such batteries may retain at least 70 of their gravimetric or volumetric capacity after a large number of cycles such as thousands of cycles.

Finally anode materials with the general formula MSn M C C may be resistant to poisoning by Mn contained in the cathode.

Anode materials with the formula CuSn TiC C may be synthesized in some embodiments by first furnace heating a mixture of Sn and other metals and then ballmilling the resulting compounds in the presence of carbon to achieve a mechanochemical reduction. The carbon may be from an elemental or polymeric carbon source. For instance it may be in the form of acetylene black or another similar material. In a specific embodiment the material is formed by first furnace heating a mixture of Sn Cu and Ti and then ballmilling the resulting compounds in the presence of carbon to achieve a mechanochemical reduction. Similar methods may be used for other materials of the general formula MSn M C C.

The third type of anode material has the general formula of MoSb C. The material may be a composite including MoSbuniformly dispersed in a conductive carbon matrix. The MoSbmay be in the form of highly crystalline particles in the size range 500 nm or less particularly of 100 nm to 1 m.

Particles of MoSbin MoSb C may constrain Sb via its crystal structure thereby preventing agglomeration of the Sb which is responsible for capacity fade in most Sb alloy electrodes. MoSbalso experiences significant changes in volume during cycling.

The inclusion of the material in a carbon matrix reduces the effects of these volume changes. MoSb C materials may have a discharge capacity of at least 500 mAh g or at least 900 mAh cm. These materials may exhibit a tap density of at least 1.5 g cm. MoSb C anodes may operate at a voltage of above 0.5 V which is sufficiently higher than the potential at which Li converts to Lito avoid plating of lithium metal on the anode or to reduce the rate of plating to a rate sufficiently low to avoid failure of the battery due to a short circuit during its expected lifetime.

In one alternative embodiment the material may further include an oxide such as AlO TiO VO MoO or WO to form a composite material.

MoSb C composite material may be formed by first firing a mixture of Mo and Sb metals in a furnace to obtain MoSb. This material may then be placed in an HEMM process with carbon to form MoSb C. The carbon may be from an elemental or polymeric carbon source. For instance it may be in the form of acetylene black or another similar material.

The fourth type of anode material has the general formula MSb M C C where M may be an electrochemically active metal and M may be another metal. In one specific embodiment the first type of anode material may have the general formula MoSb TiC C. In specific embodiments the material may be present in the form of a nanocomposite material containing MSb in a matrix of M Cand C. In particular it may contain particles of MSb with an average diameter or size of 500 nm or less 200 nm or less 100 nm or less or 50 nm or less.

In an anode material with the general formula MSb M C C MSb particles provide electrochemical activity. These particles may be nanostructured. The C portion forms a conductive carbon matrix with the M C. MSb is dispersed within this matrix.

Materials of the general formula MSb M C C may reduce or minimize the effects of changes in volume as lithium ions enter and leave the material by blending nanostructured materials that are electrochemically active towards lithium MSb with materials that are inactive towards lithium M Cand C to form composite anode materials. Although in some embodiments the nanostructured materials may offer shorter diffusion lengths for lithium ions and may accommodate the strain due to volume changes during battery cycling the large surface area to volume ratio resulting from the particles small size and the high surface reactivity of these nanostructured materials may be problematic. The addition of M C C to form an inactive matrix may help buffer the volume change in the electrochemically active material during charge discharge cycles. The M O C matrix may also reduce agglomeration of the MSb particles which is detrimental to battery performance.

Anode materials with the general formula MSb M C C may be synthesized in some embodiments by a high energy mechanical milling HEMM process. Anode materials with the formula MSb M C C may be synthesized in some embodiments by first furnace heating a mixture of Sb and other metals and then ballmilling the resulting compounds in the presence of carbon to achieve a mechanochemical reduction. The carbon may be from an elemental or polymeric carbon source. For instance it may be in the form of acetylene black or another similar material.

The invention also includes anodes made from any of the anode materials described above. Such anodes may include a metal or other conductive backing and a coating containing the anode material. The coating may be formed by applying a slurry to the metal backing. The slurry and resulting coating may contain particles of the anode material. Although in many embodiments agglomerates may not be preferred in other embodiments the coating may include agglomerates of particles of the anode material. The anode may contain only one type of anode material or it may contain multiple types of anode materials including additional anode materials different from those described above. The coating may further include conductive agents such as carbon. Furthermore the coating may contain binders such as polymeric binders to facilitate adherence of the coating to the metal backing or to facilitate formation of the coating upon drying of the slurry. In some embodiments the anode may be in the form of metal foil with a coating.

In another embodiment the invention relates to a battery containing an anode including an anode material as described above. The anode may of a type described above. The battery may further contain a cathode and an electrolyte to complete the basic components of an electrochemical cell. The cathode and electrolyte may be of any sort able to form a functional rechargeable battery with the selected anode material. The battery may further contain contacts a casing or wiring. In the case of more sophisticated batteries it may contain more complex components such as safety devices to prevent hazards if the battery overheats ruptures or short circuits. Particularly complex batteries may also contain electronics storage media processors software encoded on computer readable media and other complex regulatory components.

Batteries may be in very traditional forms such a coin cells or jelly rolls or in more complex forms such as prismatic cells. Batteries may contain more than one electrochemical cell and may contain components to connect or regulate these multiple electrochemical cells.

Batteries of the present invention may be used in a variety of applications. They may be in the form of standard battery size formats usable by a consumer interchangeably in a variety of devices.

Furthermore batteries according to the present invention may have industrial uses such as energy storage in connection with energy production for instance in a smart grid or in energy storage for factories or health care facilities for example in the place of generators.

The following examples are provided to further illustrate specific embodiments of the invention. They are not intended to disclose or describe each and every aspect of the invention in complete detail and should be not be so interpreted.

CuSb AlO C nanocomposite and CuSb C nanocomposite materials as well as electrodes and coin cells using these materials in Examples 2 7 herein were prepared as described in this Example 1.

A CuSb AlO C nanocomposite according to an embodiment of the present invention was synthesized by a reduction of SbO 99.6 purity Alfa Chem Kings Point N.Y. with aluminum 99.97 17 m particle size Alfa. Chem. and formation of CuSb with copper 99 45 m Acros Organics Geel Belgium metal powder in the presence of carbon acetylene black by a high energy mechanical milling HEMM process as illustrated below by reaction 1 SbO 2Al 4Cu 2CuSb AlO G 1023 kJ mol 1 The overall negative free energy change makes the reduction reaction 1 spontaneous. The required quantities of SbO Al and Cu were mixed with acetylene black in an SbO Al Cu C weight ratio of 80 20. Control CuSb C nanocomposite material without AlOwas obtained through a two step process i stoichiometric amounts of Cu and Sb were ball milled to form CuSb and ii the resultant CuSb powder was ball milled with 20 wt acetylene black to form the CuSb C nanocomposite. All HEMM steps were carried out in a planetary ball mill Fritsch Pulverisette 6 planetary mill for 12 hours h at a speed of 500 rpm at ambient temperature under argon atmosphere in hardened steel vials having an 80 cmcapacity with steel balls diameter and in. in a ball powder weight ratio of 20 1. The vials were sealed inside an argon filled glovebox prior to milling.

Electrodes containing CuSb AlO C nanocomposite material for use in electrochemical tests were prepared by coating a copper foil with a slurry that was composed of 70 wt. CuSb AlO C powder as the active material 15 wt. carbon black Super P as a conductive agent 15 wt. poly vinylidene fluoride PVDF as a binder and N methylpyrrolidinone NMP as the solvent. Following the coating step the copper foil was dried at 120 C. for 2 h under vacuum. CR2032 coin cells were assembled in an argon filled glovebox with the electrodes thus prepared using Celgard polypropylene as a separator lithium foil as the counter electrode and 1 M LiPFin ethylene carbonate EC diethyl carbonate DEC 1 1 v v as the electrolyte.

The phase analysis of the synthesized samples was performed with a Phillips X ray diffraction XRD system with Cu K radiation. XRD patterns of the CuSb AlO C and CuSb C nanocomposites are given in . Both nanocomposites show broad reflections corresponding to CuSb JCDPS Powder Diffraction File Card No. 22 601 . No reflections corresponding to AlOwere observed in the case of CuSb AlO C possibly due to an amorphous or poorly crystalline character of AlO.

In order to investigate any structural changes that occurred during electrochemical cycling XRD data were collected from electrodes that had been detached from cycled cells and covered with polyimide tape as a protective film. XRD was performed on electrodes that had been cycled to different points in the charge discharge cycle. The XRD patterns of cycled CuSb AlO C electrodes after 1 50 and 500 cycles support the notion that the degree of crystallinity of CuSb AlO C increases with the number of cycles .

The morphology microstructure and composition of the synthesized powders were examined with a JEOL JSM 5610 scanning electron microscope SEM system and a JEOL 2010F transmission electron microscopy TEM system.

The morphology and particle size of CuSb AlO C and CuSb C were investigated with SEM and TEM. SEM images of CuSb AlO C and CuSb C in show the sub micron particle size distribution of the composite material. The overall particle sizes of the CuSb AlO C and the CuSb C materials are similar. The TEM images of CuSb AlO C show that the material is composed of 2 10 nm sized crystalline CuSb particles mixed with carbon. The AlOin the CuSb AlO C material could not be observed with TEM. When compared to the CuSb AlO C nanocomposite the TEM of the CuSb C material shows crystalline regions that are well defined .

TEM was also used to observe changes in crystallinity and morphology of cycled electrodes. In order to understand the role of AlOin providing a significant improvement in the cycle performance of CuSb C high resolution TEM was performed on CuSb AlO C and CuSb C electrodes that had been cycled for different numbers of cycles. CuSb C was observed after 1 50 and 247 cycles. 247 cycles was chosen as the stopping point for the CuSb C cell because CuSb C already lost over 50 of its stable capacity after 247 cycles. CuSb AlO C was observed after 1 50 and 500 cycles. At 500 cycles the CuSb AlO C cell was still offering stable cycle performance and 99 coulombic efficiency.

The images in show that after one cycle the CuSb AlO C material is largely amorphous. There are some small regions of crystallinity but the particle boundaries are not well defined. After one cycle the CuSb C electrode shows well defined boundaries of crystalline spherical particles . After 50 cycles CuSb AlO C has developed areas of crystallinity. After 50 cycles CuSb C has almost completely transformed into crystalline spherical particles that are embedded in a carbon matrix. After 500 cycles CuSb AlO C has retained 94 of the capacity that was observed after 50 cycles and has transformed into well defined 2 10 nm crystalline particles that are almost entirely separate from one another and are surrounded by a matrix of AlOand carbon. After 247 cycles the CuSb C material has already lost over 50 of the capacity that was observed at cycle 50. The size of the CuSb C particles does not significantly change between cycles 50 and 247 but the CuSb C particles appear to be tightly agglomerated after 247 cycles.

In summary the presence of AlOdid not significantly change the particle size or outer morphology of CuSb C particles. However prior to cycling based on XRD and microscopy data the CuSb particles in CuSb C particles were found to be more crystalline than that in CuSb AlO C. The presence of AlOdoes not however significantly influence the particle size or morphology. The AlOmatrix allows the CuSb particles to remain separate yet electronically connected within the nanocomposite during cycling thus reducing agglomeration and providing the exceptional cycle life and lower impedance than is observed with CuSb C.

Surface characterization was performed on an uncycled CuSb AlO C electrode with a Kratos X ray photoelectron spectrometer XPS with a monochromatic Al K source. The uncycled CuSb AlO C electrode was extracted from a coin cell in an argon filled glovebox and transferred into the XPS chamber via an argon filled capsule. The surface of the electrode was cleaned of surface oxides and electrolyte salts by sputtering with a 4 keV beam energy and an extractor current of 75 to for 5.5 minutes.

The CuSb AlO C sample prepared in Example 1 was subjected to XPS analysis and the results are shown in . There are two peaks in the Al 2p region. The peak at 75.2 eV corresponds to Al 2p in AlOwhile the other peak at 77 eV corresponds to Cu 3p. The Cu 2ppeak in the CuSb AlO C sample occurs at 933.5 eV compared to 932.7 eV expected for metallic copper. This shift in the Cu 2pbinding energy indicates the absence of free metallic Cu and the presence of Cu to Sb bonding. The Sb 3d spectrum overlaps with the O 1s spectrum from AlO. There are two pairs of peaks present for Sb 3d. The binding energies of the Sb 2 peaks match closely with that of metallic Sb suggesting the presence of an amount of metallic Sb impurity although the XRD data did not indicate metallic Sb. The Sb 1 peaks are at higher binding energies than the Sb 2 peaks and are attributed to the antimony that is bound to Cu in the CuSb alloy.

Charge discharge experiments were performed galvanostatically at a constant current density of 100 mA g of active electrode material within a desired voltage range. Tap density measurements were made with a Quantachrome AT 4 Autotap machine. Electrochemical cycle testing at 25 C. was also performed with full coffee bag type cells with 4 V manganese spinet material as the cathode and lithium metal as the reference electrode.

The voltage profile and differential capacity plots DCP for the CuSb AlO C nanocomposite are shown in . The CuSb AlO C nanocomposite exhibits first cycle discharge and charge capacities of 633 and 434 mAh g respectively implying an irreversible capacity loss of 199 mAh g and a coulombic efficiency of 68 in the first cycle. A feature of the DCP shown in is that there are three peaks on the discharge portion of the plot and four peaks in the charge portion of the plot. This suggests that there may be an irreversible reaction that takes place during the charging of the CuSb AlO C electrode. It is also possible that the reaction mechanism during discharging is different from the reaction mechanism during charging.

One of the significant features of CuSb AlO C anode material lies in the cycle life. shows the cyclability of CuSb AlO C over 500 cycles. CuSb AlO C cycles well for 500 cycles at 99 coulombic efficiency. The presence of AlOin the nanocomposite has a significant impact on the cycle performance of CuSb AlO C as compared with that of CuSb C. As seen in CuSb C alloy anodes are only stable for approximately 100 cycles. The dramatic improvement in volumetric capacity of CuSb AlO C over graphite is shown in . The high temperature performance of CuSb C was slightly better than that of CuSb AlO C. Both CuSb based materials were stable for 100 cycles at high temperature . When cycled at different charge rates CuSb C performs comparably to CuSb AlO C but yields a higher discharge capacity. A higher initial discharge capacity was observed for CuSb C cells during all other cycle tests as well. Both CuSb C and CuSb AlO C materials showed excellent rate capability. The cycle performance of CuSb AlO C and CuSb C at different charge rates is shown in .

In summary the CuSb C alloy anode was found to show stable cycle performance only to 100 cycles. Through the incorporation of AlOin to the alloy anode to form CuSb AlO C the stable cycle performance was extended from 100 cycles to 500. After one cycle and after 20 cycles the CuSb AlO C material showed lower surface charge transfer and bulk resistances than those of CuSb C.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic analysis EIS was conducted with Solartron SI1260 equipment. A signal of 10 MV in amplitude was applied in the frequency range of 10 kHz to 0.001 Hz. In the EIS measurements the CuSb AlO C nanocomposite served as the working electrode and lithium foil served as the counter and reference electrodes. The impedance response was measured after different numbers of charge discharge cycles after 0 1 and 20 cycles at 2 V vs. Li Li.

EIS measurements of CuSb AlO C and CuSb C both prepared as described in Example 1 after 0 1 and 20 cycles were performed in order to further understand the electrochemical performance and the results are presented in . The EIS data were analyzed based on the equivalent circuit and variables shown in . Rrefers to uncompensated resistance between the working electrode and the lithium reference electrode CPErefers to the constant phase element of the surface layer Rrefers to the resistance of the SEI layer CPErefers to the CPE of the double layer Rrefers to the charge transfer resistance and Zrefers to the Warburg impedance. Generally the EIS spectrum can be divided into three frequency regions low frequency medium to low frequency and high frequency which correspond to cell geometric capacitance charge transfer reaction and lithium ion diffusion through the surface layer respectively. The slope of the impedance curve in the low frequency region is related to lithium ion diffusion in the bulk of the active material.

Prior to cycling CuSb C has lower impedance than CuSb AlO C in all three ranges of frequency . This behavior is expected due to the fact that a larger weight percent of the CuSb C electrode material is made up of a copper containing species and the AlOin the CuSb AlO C material is electronically insulating. Before either material is cycled the curved portion of the impedance measurement is dominated by the charge transfer resistance R which is related to the electrochemical reaction between the particles or the reaction between the electrode and the electrolyte. After one cycle the shape of the impedance curves for both materials changes. A semicircle is observed for each of the high and medium to low frequency ranges. The overall impedance of both materials has decreased compared to the values observed before cycling but the impedance of the CuSb C is higher than that of CuSb AlO C in the medium to low and low frequency ranges. After 20 cycles the difference in the impedance response of CuSb C and CuSb AlO C is even more significant and CuSb AlO C exhibits lower resistance in all frequency ranges.

One of the drawbacks to using carbon anode materials alongside commercial LiMnOspinel cathodes is the poisoning of the anode by the manganese ions Mn that dissolve from the cathode lattice during cycling. In order to test the resistance of CuSb AlO C to manganese poisoning 3 electrode pouch cells were constructed with CuSb AlO C as the working electrode 4 V manganese spinel material as the counter electrode and lithium metal as the reference electrode. The cycle performance of the CuSb AlO C material in the pouch cell does not change significantly from that of the coin cell suggesting that CuSb AlO C anodes may be resistant to Mn poisoning and can be used with manganese spinel cathodes in lithium ion cells. The performance of the CuSb AlO C pouch cell is shown in .

CuSn TiC C material as anodes and coin cells containing this material were prepared and experiments were carried out in a manner similar to that used for CuSb AlO C in Example 1 above. In particular CuSn TiC C nanocomposite material was prepared by first obtaining a mixture of Cu Sn Ti alloy phases by heating a mixture of Sn 99.8 

Testing of this material shows desirable material properties similar to those obtained with CuSb AlO C. In particular the presence of CuSnin a conductive matrix of TiC and C was verified as was the presence of a Cu framework containing electrochemically active Sn particles. The conductive matrix improves the cycle life of CuSnas compared to the performance data for CuSnalone available in scientific literature.

Samples were characterized with a Rigaku X ray diffractometer with Cu K radiation Hitachi S 5500 STEM and JEOL 2010 TEM operating at 300 kV. The STEM and TEM samples were prepared by dispersing the sample in ethanol depositing it drop wise onto a carbon coated copper grid and removing the ethanol at ambient temperature. The electrodes for the electrochemical evaluation were prepared by mixing 70 wt active material CuSn TiC C powder 15 wt carbon black Super P and 15 wt polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF in N methylpyrrolidone NMP to form a slurry. The slurry was spread onto a copper foil and dried at 120 C. for 2 h under vacuum. The electrodes were then assembled into CR2032 coin cells in an Ar filled glove box using Celgard polypropylene separator lithium foil as the counter electrode and 1M LiPFin ethylene carbonate EC diethyl carbonate DEC 1 1 v v electrolyte. The discharge charge experiments were performed galvanostatically at a constant current density of 100 mA g of active material within the voltage range of 0 2.0 V vs. Li Li or 0.2 V OCV vs. Li Li Cycle testing was performed at 25 C.

In order to better understand the changes in morphology of the CuSn TiC C material during cycling XRD was performed on electrode materials that had been fully discharged down to 0 V vs. Li Li and cycled between 0 and 200 cycles. After 200 cycles the capacity of the CuSn TiC C electrode had been reduced to less than one percent of the original capacity. shows the XRD patterns of CuSn TiC C electrodes after up to 200 cycles. The XRD patterns do not change significantly for the electrodes that have been cycled even after the material stops showing any appreciable capacity. This indicates that the particles are not agglomerating or significantly changing in size.

The cycled electrodes used in Example 9 further analyzed via TEM. The results of the XRD on cycled CuSn TiC C electrodes are further supported by the TEM images in . The TEM images show that the morphology and size of the CuSnparticles do not change significantly during cycling even after the material has failed.

The voltage profile and differential capacity plot of the CuSn TiC C nanocomposite are shown in . When cycled between 0 and 2 V vs. Li Li the nanocomposite exhibits first discharge and charge capacities of 797 and 629 mAh g respectively. When the material is cycled between 0.2 V vs. Li Li and the open circuit voltage OCV for the material the first discharge and charge capacities are 321 mAh g and 225 mAh g respectively which indicates that the irreversible capacity loss is 96 mAh g and the coulombic efficiency is around 70 . The irreversible capacity loss may be largely associated with the reduction of the electrolyte on the active material surface and the formation of solid electrolyte interfacial SEI layer. The major peaks in the differential capacity plot when the material is cycled down to 0 V vs. Li Li occur around 0.35 V and 0.13 V vs. Li Li. When the material is cycled between 0.2 V vs. Li Li and the open circuit voltage OCV for the material only one peak is observed in the discharge cycle at around 0.31V vs. Li Li inset . This change in the differential capacity plot and the corresponding reduction in capacity indicate that the reaction of lithium with CuSnis not complete when the material is discharged down to 0.2 V vs. Li Li however a drastic improvement in cycle life is observed. The improvement in cycle life when the CuSnmaterial is kept above 0.2 V vs. Li Li is likely due to the avoidance of the significant structural changes that occur when Cu is extruded from the CuSnmaterial and replaced with additional lithium to achieve LiSn.

Based upon the differential capacity plot and the previously published reaction mechanism for CuSn the reaction mechanism for the CuSn TiC C material is as follows 10Li CuSn 5 LiCuSn Cu 1 2.2Li LiCuSn LiSn Cu 2 This reaction mechanism is consistent with what has been published in the literature for CuSnmaterials. When the material is discharged to 0.2 V vs. Li Li step two of the above reaction mechanism does not occur.

In summary the second cycle discharge capacity of the CuSn TiC C was 1340 mAh cm 610 mAh g and the tap density was 2.2 g cm. The volumetric capacity of CuSn TiC C is approximately 4.5 times higher than a graphite anode. CuSn TiC C also exhibits low impedance described in further detail in Example 12 and good rate capacity.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic analysis EIS was conducted with a Solartron SI1260 impedance analyzer by applying a 10 mV amplitude signal in the frequency range of 10 kHz to 0.001 Hz. CuSn TiC C served as the working electrode and lithium foil served as the counter and reference electrodes. The impedance response was measured after zero one and 20 charge discharge cycles at 2 V vs. Li Li.

To gain insight into the electrochemical performance of CuSn TiC C EIS measurements were conducted at 2 V vs. Li Li before cycling after the 1st cycle and after the 20th cycle. The EIS data were analyzed based on an equivalent circuit given in . In Rrefers to uncompensated resistance between the working electrode and the lithium reference electrode CPErefers to the constant phase element of the surface layer Rrefers to the resistance of the SEI layer CPErefers to the constant phase element of the double layer Rrefers to the charge transfer resistance and Zrefers to the Warburg impedance. Generally the EIS spectrum can be divided into three frequency regions i.e. low frequency medium to low frequency and high frequency regions which correspond respectively to the geometric capacitance of the cell the charge transfer reaction and the lithium ion diffusion through the surface layer. The EIS spectra recorded before cycling after one cycle and after 20 cycles in consist of two semicircles and a line. The diameter of the semicircle in the high frequency region lowest Z values is a measure of the resistance Rof the SEI layer. The diameter of the semicircle in the medium frequency region middle Z values is a measure of the charge transfer resistance R which is related to the electrochemical reaction between the particles or between the electrode and the electrolyte. The portion of the impedance curve that has a linear slope is related to lithium ion diffusion in the bulk of the active material.

Before cycling inset the CuSn TiC C sample exhibits R R and bulk diffusion resistances that are all an order of magnitude larger than the resistances of the CuSn TiC C samples after 1 or 20 cycles. After the first cycle the SEI layer has formed and the majority of the irreversible capacity loss has occurred. As a consequence to the formation of the SEI layer the overall impedance in all frequency ranges decreases after the first cycle. After 20 cycles the discharge capacity has begun to increase slightly and this may be due to a decrease in bulk diffusion and surface resistance. When comparing the charge transfer resistance between the first and 20cycle it was observed that the charge transfer resistance of the sample that had been cycled 20 times was higher though not significantly. An increase in the charge transfer resistance after 20 cycles indicates that the electrochemical reactions between the particles or between the electrode and the electrolyte are becoming more difficult.

MoSb C and MoSbmaterials as well as electrodes and coin cells using these materials were prepared as described in this Example 13.

First the MoSballoy powders were obtained by heating a mixture of required amounts of Sb 99.9 Aldrich St. Louis Mo. and Mo 99.8 Aldrich powders at 780 C. in a flowing 5 Hatmosphere for 18 h. The MoSballoy obtained was then ground and sieved to eliminate particles over 100 m. The MoSbpowder with particle size 

Electrodes for electrochemical evaluation were prepared by mixing 70 wt active material MoSb C powder 15 wt carbon black Super P and 15 wt polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF in N methylpyrrolidone NMP to form a slurry. The slurry was spread onto a copper foil and dried at 120 C. for 2 h under vacuum. The electrodes were then assembled into CR2032 coin cells in an Ar filled glove box using Celgard polypropylene separator lithium foil as the counter electrode and 1M LiPFin ethylene carbonate EC diethyl carbonate DEC 1 1 v v electrolyte.

Samples were characterized with a Phillips X ray diffractometer with Cu K radiation. shows the XRD patterns of the MoSband MoSb C samples. Both samples exhibit sharp peaks corresponding to crystalline MoSb JCPDS No. 019 0807 with a small peak corresponding to a trace amount of MoO JCPDS No. 032 0671 but without any peaks corresponding to Mo JCPDS No. 004 0809 Sb JCPDS No. 005 0562 or SbO JCPDS No. 005 0543 confirming the formation of MoSb. The unit cell consists of four MoSbgroups with a total of 12 Mo 12 Sb1 and 16 Sb2 atoms and a lattice parameter a 9.5713 0.0008 . MoSbhas the cubic IrGestructure consisting of two interlocking face condensed antiprisms as shown in . One of the interlocking antiprisms is formed by eight Sb2 atoms that surround each Sb1 atom. Each Sb1 atom is also surrounded by two tetrahedra one tetrahedron is made up of four Mo atoms and the other is made up of four Sb1 atoms. The other interlocking antiprism is a distorted square antiprism composed of a Mo atom coordinated to four Sb1 and four Sb2 atoms at the corners. In this structure the Sb2 atoms are coordinated to three Mo atoms one Sb2 atom and six Sb1 atoms.

To investigate the structural changes that may occur during electrochemical cycling XRD data were collected on electrodes that had been cycled and then extracted from their cells. In order to investigate the structural changes that occur during electrochemical cycling XRD data were collected on electrodes that had been cycled and then extracted from the cells. XRD patterns recorded with electrodes discharged to 0.45 V vs. Li Li fully discharged electrodes and fully charged electrodes are shown in . The data indicate the complete disappearance of the crystalline MoSbphase at 0.45 V vs. Li Li followed by the appearance of LiSb when the electrode is in the fully discharged state. When the electrode is then fully charged the crystalline MoSbphase reappears. If the Mo is extruded as Mo metal from MoSbduring the discharge process as with other antimony based alloy anode materials then the XRD pattern would be expected to show peaks for Mo metal along with that for LiSb in . However does not show any peaks for Mo metal suggesting either the Mo atoms remain in the framework of LiSb or extruded as amorphous Mo metal.

In order to better understand the source of the capacity fade in the MoSb C sample XRD was performed on electrode materials that had been cycled for greater than 100 cycles and showed severe capacity fade. shows the XRD patterns of MoSb C after one cycle and after 111 cycles. After one cycle peaks for crystalline MoSbwere present in the XRD pattern. After 111 cycles no peaks for crystalline MoSbwere observed.

A Hitachi S 5500 STEM and a JEOL 2010 TEM operating at 300 kV were used. The STEM and TEM samples were prepared by dispersing the sample in ethanol depositing it dropwise onto a carbon coated copper grid and removing the ethanol at ambient temperature. shows the TEM images of the MoSb C composite. The TEM images and diffraction pattern of MoSb C show the highly crystalline nature of the material. The STEM images shown in reveal the sub micron particle size and a homogeneous distribution of Sb Mo and C in the MoSb C composite. The SEM images of MoSb C and acetylene in show the sub micron particle size distribution in the composite material as well as the homogenous distribution of carbon and the MoSb.

Also in order to better understand the source of the capacity fade in the MoSb C sample high resolution TEM was performed on electrode materials that had been cycled for greater than 100 cycles and showed severe capacity fade. From the TEM images in small regions of crystalline MoSbwere detected but are smaller and more isolated from one another than in the uncycled MoSb C sample. The TEM data suggests that the capacity fade observed with MoSb C at higher number of cycles is due to the breaking and separation of the large crystalline MoSbparticles that are present before cycling.

Discharge charge experiments were performed galvanostatically at a constant current density of 100 mA g of active material within the voltage range of 0 2.0 V vs. Li Li. Cycle testing was performed at 25 C. Pouch lithium ion cells consisting of the MoSb C anode and a spinel manganese oxide cathode were also assembled and cycled at room temperature.

The voltage profile and differential capacity plot of the MoSb C composite are shown in . The composite exhibits first discharge and charge capacities of 736 and 606 mAh g respectively implying an irreversible capacity loss of 130 mAh g and a coulombic efficiency of 82 in the first cycle for the composite. The irreversible capacity loss may be largely associated with the reduction of the electrolyte on the active material surface and the formation of solid electrolyte interfacial SEI layer. The major peaks in the differential capacity plot around 0.8 V vs. Li Li for alloying and around 1.0 V vs. Li Li for dealloying correspond to the reaction of lithium with antimony. The electrochemical reaction between amorphous carbon and lithium appears as a broad peak below 0.2 V vs. Li Li.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic analysis EIS was conducted with a Solartron SI1260 impedance analyzer by applying a 10 mV amplitude signal in the frequency range of 10 kHz to 0.001 Hz. MoSb C served as the working electrode and lithium foil served as the counter and reference electrodes. The impedance response was measured after one and 20 charge discharge cycles at 2 V vs. Li Li.

To gain insight into the electrochemical performance of MoSband MoSb C EIS measurements were conducted at 2 V vs Li Li before cycling after the 1st cycle and after the 20th cycle. The EIS data were analyzed based on an equivalent circuit given in . In Rrefers to uncompensated resistance between the working electrode and the lithium reference electrode CPErefers to the constant phase element of the surface layer Rrefers to the resistance of the SEI layer CPErefers to the constant phase element of the double layer Rrefers to the charge transfer resistance and Zrefers to the Warburg impedance. Generally the EIS spectrum can be divided into three frequency regions i.e. low frequency medium to low frequency and high frequency regions which correspond respectively to the geometric capacitance of the cell the charge transfer reaction and the lithium ion diffusion through the surface layer. The EIS spectra recorded before cycling in consists of one semicircle and a line. After the 1st cycle and the 20th cycle the EIS spectra in consist of two semicircles and a line. The diameter of the semicircle in the high frequency region lowest Z values is a measure of the resistance Rof the SEI layer but is not observed for either material before cycling has been performed. The diameter of the semicircle in the medium frequency region middle Z values is a measure of the charge transfer resistance R which is related to the electrochemical reaction between the particles or between the electrode and the electrolyte. The portion of the impedance curve that has a linear slope is related to lithium ion diffusion in the bulk of the active material.

Before cycling the MoSbsample exhibits a higher Rand bulk diffusion resistance than the MoSb C sample. The semicircle corresponding to Rcannot be observed in the impedance measurements before cycling. After the first cycle both the samples exhibit two distinct semicircles corresponding to Rand R. The MoSb C sample shows higher Rthan MoSb due to the development of the SEI layer. The growth of the SEI layer is more pronounced in the MoSb C sample most likely because of the carbon. The effects of a more significant SEI layer can also be seen in the larger first cycle irreversible capacity loss for MoSb C compared to that for the MoSbsample . Rand the bulk diffusion resistance of the MoSb C sample are higher than those of MoSbafter the first cycle presumably because the MoSbparticles are not separated from one another by carbon. After the 20cycle the bulk diffusion resistance of the MoSbsample becomes greater than that of the MoSb C sample because the MoSbelectrode has already begun breaking down and encountering significant capacity fade.

Full pouch cells were also assembled with the MoSb C composite as the anode and the spinel manganese oxide cathode to determine the resistance of the MoSb C electrode to poisoning by the dissolved Mn from the spinel cathode. The full cell with the MoSb C anode and manganese oxide spinel cathode shows good cyclability over 100 cycles indicating the resistance of the MoSb C composite to manganese poisoning . The slight difference in performance between the coin cell and the full pouch cell after 70 80 cycles may be related to the differences in construction of the cells and the extent of compression and contact.
