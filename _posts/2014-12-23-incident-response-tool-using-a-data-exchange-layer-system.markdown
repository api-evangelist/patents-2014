This disclosure generally relates to systems and methods for an incident response tool using a data exchange layer system.

Reliance on computer systems and devices by people and companies highlights the growing importance of computer security. Computer security may encompass processes and mechanisms by which digital equipment information and services are protected from unintended or unauthorized access. User devices such as computers laptops smartphones tablets wearable computers and the like may require specialized tools to identify problems. The specialized tools may be used to detect and responds to incidents that may be affecting performance or security of the user device. Unfortunately in a world where speed and connectivity are highly valued currently available tools may require significant amounts of time to identify and isolate problems on user devices.

This disclosure relates to among other things systems methods computer readable media techniques and methodology for an incident response tool in a data exchange layer system. A data exchange layer system may be an open environment or architecture for adaptive security that provides real time bi directional communication between devices to enable efficient and speedy exchange of data at a reduced operational overhead. The incident response tool may leverage the messaging system of the data exchange layer system to communicate with user devices and broker servers efficiently at low latencies. By leveraging the data exchange layer system the incident response tool may greatly reduce the time required to obtain data e.g. diagnostic data from user devices located anywhere within the data exchange layer system. The data exchange layer system allows the incident response tool to be scaled to hundreds of thousands or millions of user devices.

The incident response tool may utilize proactive incident response traps pushed to user devices to determine a current state of the user device through constant monitoring and to be notified when the trap is triggered. In some embodiments the incident response tool facilitates a streaming view of activity locally on a user device through the generation and maintenance of local cache or histories. The streaming view may include an adjustable period of retention which may allow incident responders to search into the historical record of the user device to identify activity across large sets of systems without the expense of central processing of the data associated with each user device within the data exchange layer system. In some embodiments the incident response tool may generate baselines to establish normality of a user device or a group of user devices. Baselines may be generated based on data collected from the user device either through the local cache or history of the user device or data obtained through one or more collectors of the user device. The baselines may be non deterministic and used to identify abnormal device or user behavior. Once the abnormal behavior has been identified further steps may be taken based on other relevant data.

At block the incident response module s of an incident response server may initiate a request for data and transmit the request to one or more broker server s . In some embodiments the request may be generated and transmitted leveraging the data exchange layer system. For example the data exchange layer system may propagate the request to the devices connected or associated with the data exchange layer system quickly. In some embodiments messages originating from the incident response server may be sent to one or more broker server s for distribution to user device s . The broker server s may transmit received messages to other broker server s and or any associated user device s . Each broker server s that receives a message may transmit the message to user device s associated with the respective broker server s . The request may include one or more parameters for data as specified by an administrator initiating the request. For example parameters may include characteristics of the user device s e.g. type of device characteristics of the users of the user device s e.g. membership in a group role of the user etc. or the like. In some embodiments the incident response server may transmit the request for data to multiple brokers

At block the incident response module s of a broker server may receive the request from the incident response server and communicate the request to one or more user device s associated with the broker server to obtain the requested data. In some embodiments the incident response module s may process the request and identify one or more parameters specified by in the request. In some embodiments the incident response module s may identify one or more topics associated with the identified parameters and transmit the request to the user device s subscribed to the topic. User device s may subscribe to topics based on configurations set by an administrator of the system or based at least in part on characteristics of the user device or user at time of configuration to operate within the data exchange layer system.

At block the incident response module s may receive data from the one or more user device s associated with the broker server and process the obtained data. In some embodiments processing the obtained data may include aggregating the multiple messages containing the requested data from multiple user device s and transmitting a single message containing the aggregation of messages and or data from the user device s to the incident response server .

At block the incident response module s may receive the data processed by the incident response module s of one or more broker server s . The incident response module s may receive data from multiple broker server s and may process all the data received in response to the request for information. In some embodiments the request for data may have been related to a single incident which the administrator is investigating. In other embodiments the request for data may have been related to the generation of individual and or group baselines for a subset of user device s . In some embodiments the incident response module s may analyze the data and generate reports. In some embodiments the incident response module s may present the processed data to an administrator who may take further action based at least in part on the processed data.

At block the incident response module s of an incident response server may create and configure an incident response trap. An incident response trap may comprise one or more conditional statements for monitoring activity on a user device .

At block the incident response module s may associate one or more reactions to the incident response trap. A reaction may be any action that may be chained to or otherwise associated with the incident response trap where once the trap is triggered e.g. conditional statements have been met a specified action or actions may be taken. For example an incident response trap may be configured so that a reaction occurs when an attempt is made by the user device to contact a website designated as untrustworthy. The reaction may be to terminate the process attempting to access the website.

At block the incident response module s may initiate propagation of the incident response trap and associated reactions to user devices via broker server s of the data exchange layer system. The incident response trap and associated reactions may be pushed to user device s in the data exchange layer system by transmitting the incident response trap and associated reactions to one or more broker server s which may in turn transmit the incident response trap and associated reactions to one or more user device s associated with the broker server .

At block the incident response module s may receive notification when the incident response trap is triggered. In some embodiments the notification may indicate a history associated with the incident response trap e.g. previous events that triggered the trap data associated with the triggering of the incident response trap e.g. date time event that triggered the trap . In some embodiments an administrator may take further action in response to the notification such as increasing monitoring functions for the user device on which the incident response trap was triggered or the like.

In another example an incident responder may wish to determine in a 500 000 node environment the existence of a particular file on the file system. User device s may have one or more persistent collector s which may have hashed all the files on the file system e.g. using MD5 SHA1 or SHA2 algorithms to hash the files and stored the data in a local cache or history of the user device . Persistent collector s may be collector s that are pushed onto user device s when they are associated with the data exchange layer system and may continuously monitor data on user device s such as monitor file process registry and or network activity of a user device . The persistent collector s may obtain data through direct measurement of activity of the user device or may obtain data from other collector s . Persistent collector s may continuously collect data on the user device without any user intervention. The incident responder may then initiate a request to determine of a particular file one any of the user devices in the data exchange layer system. As the files have already been hashed by the persistent collector s on the user device s the incident responder may obtain the requested data immediately rather than having to wait for the user device to hash all files in its system and then determining whether the requested file exists on the user device .

At block the incident response module s of an incident response server may create and configure one or more collectors and push a copy of the collector to one or more user device s . In some embodiments an administrator may specify the type of data to collect duration of the collection of data rules for expunging collected data and the like. In some embodiments collector s may be designated persistent collectors which may collect all data associated with monitor file process registry and or network activity of a user device . Persistent collector s may obtain data from other collector s or directly from the user device . The incident response module s may facilitate pushing the configured collector s to some or all of the user device s in the data exchange layer system. Accordingly the incident response module s may transmit a copy of the collector s to one or more broker server s which may then transmit a copy of the collector s to one or more user device s associated with the broker server s .

At block the collector s of the user device s may collect and store data on the user device s in local caches or histories while the incident response client s may receive and respond to requests from incident response server s by retrieving data from the local caches or histories analyzing the local caches or histories and identifying data relevant to the request.

At block the incident response module s may transmit a request for data to one or more broker server s . The request for data may be received by each of the one or more broker server s and processed to identify any parameters specified in the request. For example the request may indicate data should be obtained from smartphones or tablets. The incident response module s on each of the one or more broker server s may determine that the identified parameters from the request correspond to one or more topics to which user device s subscribe in association with the broker server s . The incident response module s may then transmit the data request to the one or more user device s subscribed to the identified topic and may receive data retrieved and analyzed by the incident response client s of the user device s from the local cache or histories of the user device . The incident response module s may then aggregate the data received from the one or more user device s and transmit a single message to the incident response server .

At block the incident response module s may receive the requested data from the one or more broker server s . The incident response module s may process the data received from each of the broker server s and may use the data obtained from the user device s for different purposes such as identifying details about isolated issues generating baselines or the like.

At block the incident response module s of an incident response server may initiate a request for data and transmit the request to one or more broker server s . In some embodiments the request for data may be for a subset of user device s such as those associated with a specific group of users type of user device or the like. The request may be transmitted through the data exchange layer system wherein the request is transmitted to one or more broker server s which may then transmit the message to one or more user device s associated with a broker server .

At block the incident response module s may receive the requested data from one or more broker server s collected from one or more user device s . In some embodiments the broker server s may have transmitted the request to user device s subscribed to a topic determined to be associated or relevant to the requested information. In some embodiments the broker server s may act as an intermediary within the data exchange layer system where the broker server s may receive messages from multiple associated user device s process the received messages from the user device s and generate a single message associated with the received messages from the multiple user device s and transmit the message containing the requested data from the user device s to the incident response server thus reducing network traffic within the system.

At block incident response module s may generate baselines for a group of user devices based on the received data. In some embodiments the data received from broker server s may be individual baselines associated with their respective user device s . The incident response module s may generate one or more baselines associated with the subset or group of user device s from which the data was received. In some embodiments the data received may be data from user device s obtained for the respective local cache or history of the user device s . The incident response module s may generate individual baselines for the respective user device s and or one or more group baselines associated with the set of user device s from which the data was received.

In some embodiments the baselines may be computed baselines wherein data received from user device s may be processed and baselines may be generated by computing values for different types of activity. For example a computed baseline for network activity may calculate on a periodic basis the number of connections and types of connections based on the protocol. The calculated data may be mapped out and a baseline may be generated based on the calculated values.

At block incident response module s may configure one or more thresholds associated with generated baselines. For example the thresholds may indicate a range of deviation to be used to determine whether a given activity is abnormal. For example if the baseline indicates logon activity by users between 9 00 AM and 10 00 AM the threshold may indicate a range of plus or minus thirty minutes of the baseline during which time the activity would still be considered normal. If however the logon activity occurs outside of the threshold e.g. 3 00 AM then such behavior because it exceeds the configured threshold may be deemed abnormal behavior.

At block incident response module s may monitor user device s and compare data on user device s to baselines. In some embodiments the incident response module s may monitor the user device s through the use of proactive incident response traps e.g. as describe in relation to where the baselines e.g. individual or group may be used in a conditional statement of the proactive incident response trap to identify abnormal behavior. In some embodiments an administrator may compare an identified activity or event on a user device to an individual or group baseline to determine if the activity or event is abnormal.

At block incident response module s may receive a notification when data from the user device s deviates from generated baselines and exceed one or more thresholds. In some embodiments the notification may be received from the user device s via a broker server in association with a proactive incident response trap or may be received in response to the user device determining an activity or event deviates from the individual baseline associated with the user device and exceeds one or more thresholds configured at block . An administrator may choose to further monitor the user device by requesting further data or may take a proactive measure based on the determination that the activity or event on the user device is abnormal.

Each such software component may include computer executable instructions that responsive to execution cause at least a portion of the functionality described herein e.g. one or more operations of the illustrative methods described herein to be performed.

A software component may be coded in any of a variety of programming languages. An illustrative programming language may be a lower level programming language such as an assembly language associated with a particular hardware architecture and or operating system platform. A software component comprising assembly language instructions may require conversion into executable machine code by an assembler prior to execution by the hardware architecture and or platform.

Another example programming language may be a higher level programming language that may be portable across multiple architectures. A software component comprising higher level programming language instructions may require conversion to an intermediate representation by an interpreter or a compiler prior to execution.

Other examples of programming languages include but are not limited to a macro language a shell or command language a job control language a script language a database query or search language or a report writing language. In one or more example embodiments a software component comprising instructions in one of the foregoing examples of programming languages may be executed directly by an operating system or other software component without having to be first transformed into another form.

A software component may be stored as a file or other data storage construct. Software components of a similar type or functionally related may be stored together such as for example in a particular directory folder or library. Software components may be static e.g. pre established or fixed or dynamic e.g. created or modified at the time of execution .

Software components may invoke or be invoked by other software components through any of a wide variety of mechanisms. Invoked or invoking software components may comprise other custom developed application software operating system functionality e.g. device drivers data storage e.g. file management routines other common routines and services etc. or third party software components e.g. middleware encryption or other security software database management software file transfer or other network communication software mathematical or statistical software image processing software and format translation software .

Software components associated with a particular solution or system may reside and be executed on a single platform or may be distributed across multiple platforms. The multiple platforms may be associated with more than one hardware vendor underlying chip technology or operating system. Furthermore software components associated with a particular solution or system may be initially written in one or more programming languages but may invoke software components written in another programming language.

Computer executable program instructions may be loaded onto a special purpose computer or other particular machine a processor or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a particular machine such that execution of the instructions on the computer processor or other programmable data processing apparatus causes one or more functions or operations specified in the flow diagrams to be performed. These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer readable storage medium CRSM that upon execution may direct a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to function in a particular manner such that the instructions stored in the computer readable storage medium produce an article of manufacture including instruction means that implement one or more functions or operations specified in the flow diagrams. The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to cause a series of operational elements or steps to be performed on the computer or other programmable apparatus to produce a computer implemented process.
