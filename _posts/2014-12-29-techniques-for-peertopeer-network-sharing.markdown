Mobile devices may use a radio network interface to perform data communications such as to a cellular or Wi Fi access point. Such data communications may expend the battery power of the mobile device and may incur data communication charges. Cellular data networks may use metered data. The amount of data transferred across a cellular data network may be monitored and debited against a user allocation of data. Similarly the amount of data transferred across a cellular data network may be monitored and the user billed a fee based on the amount.

The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some novel embodiments described herein. This summary is not an extensive overview and it is not intended to identify key critical elements or to delineate the scope thereof. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

Various embodiments are generally directed to techniques for peer to peer network sharing. Some embodiments are particularly directed to techniques for peer to peer network sharing based on the accrual and expenditure of sharing credits with a sharing authority. In one embodiment for example an apparatus may comprise a sharing control component and a local proxy component. The sharing control component may be operative to transmit an offer from the first mobile device to a second mobile device for the second mobile device to act as a proxy for the first mobile device for the performance of network services in return for a transfer of sharing credit from a first account to a second account with a sharing authority the first account associated with the first mobile device the second account associated with the second mobile device and receive an offer acceptance from the second mobile device. The local proxy component may be operative to receive configuration information and configure the first mobile device to use the second mobile device as a network proxy using the configuration information. Other embodiments are described and claimed.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends certain illustrative aspects are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These aspects are indicative of the various ways in which the principles disclosed herein can be practiced and all aspects and equivalents thereof are intended to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. Other advantages and novel features will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the drawings.

Various embodiments are directed to sharing a network connection between mobile devices to extend one device s connection to another. In various situations one mobile device may be better equipped to perform network activity than another. Without limitation the mobile device may use a cellular provider providing a better quality connection in a particular geographic area the mobile device may have more of its cellular data allocation available or the mobile device may have a cellular data plan for that geographic area while the other mobile device does not. As such a mobile device may benefit from being empowered to use another mobile device s network connection.

However the mobile device sharing its connection may need an incentive to do so. One possible incentive is the reception of credit with a sharing authority managing the networking sharing operations. The user of the sharing mobile device may later be in a situation in which they want to use the network connection of another mobile device and may therefore be motivated to accrue sharing credits with the sharing authority that the sharing mobile device may use later to benefit from another device sharing its network. Further in some embodiments the user of the sharing mobile device may be able to sell its sharing credits to other users of the sharing service if it accumulates more than it expects to need. As a result users may be motivated to share their network connection which may make more networks available for use by devices in need of a network.

Reference is now made to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding thereof. It may be evident however that the novel embodiments can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate a description thereof. The intention is to cover all modifications equivalents and alternatives consistent with the claimed subject matter.

It is worthy to note that a and b and c and similar designators as used herein are intended to be variables representing any positive integer. Thus for example if an implementation sets a value for a 5 then a complete set of components illustrated as components through may include components and . The embodiments are not limited in this context.

A mobile device may communicate with server devices using wireless transmissions to exchange network traffic. Exchanging network traffic such as may be included in the performance of a user request may comprise transmitting and receiving network traffic via a network interface controller NIC . A NIC comprises a hardware component connecting a computer device such as mobile device to a computer network. The NIC may be associated with a software network interface empowering software applications to access and use the NIC. Network traffic may be received over the computer network as signals transmitted over data links. The network traffic may be received by capturing these signals and interpreting them. The NIC may receive network traffic over the computer network and transfer the network traffic to memory storage accessible to software applications using a network interface application programming interface API 

Mobile devices may comprise a cellular interface for access to cellular systems. Mobile devices may comprise a Wi Fi interface for access to Wi Fi access points. Cellular systems may be provided by cellular providers. Users of mobile devices may need to have cellular data subscriptions or purchase pre paid cellular data in order to access a cellular system. Wi Fi access points may be provided by a plurality of different operators. Some of the Wi Fi access points may be personal in nature such as a home Wi Fi network operated by the user of a mobile device based on a domestic Internet connection. Some of the Wi Fi access points may be provided by business entities providing free complimentary or pay Wi Fi access in the public sphere.

A first mobile device may use first cellular signals to access first cellular system . The first cellular system may be provided by a cellular provider with which the user of the first mobile device has a cellular data subscription or pre paid cellular data allocation for the first mobile device . A second mobile device may use second cellular signals to access second cellular system . The second cellular system may be provided by a cellular provider with which the user of the second mobile device has a cellular data subscription or pre paid cellular data allocation for the second mobile device .

The user of the first mobile device may have one or more motivations for not using the first cellular system or for limiting their use of the first cellular system . In a first case the first cellular system may offer poor performance to the first mobile device in a current context it may be suffering technical problems it may offer poor service to an area in which the first mobile device is current operating etc. In a second case a cellular data allocation for the first mobile device from a cellular data subscription or pre paid cellular data purchase may be running low. In a third case the first mobile device may not have a cellular data allocation with the first cellular system and therefore be paying for example per kilobyte or per megabyte charges. One or more of these cases may be combined and other cases in which the user of the first mobile device is motivated to limit or avoid use of the first cellular system may exist. The user may be willing to use the first cellular system to exchange first sharing information with a sharing authority in order to set up network sharing with a local mobile device but may desire to avoid using the first cellular system for any other operations.

The user of the second mobile device may have one or more advantages with regards to a network connection as compared to other mobile users. In a first case the second cellular system used by the second mobile device may offer superior performance to other cellular systems providing service to the area a more reliable connection a higher bandwidth connection a lower latency connection etc. In a second case the second mobile device may have a cellular data allocation for a geographic area in which the second mobile device is operating while nearby mobile devices do not. In a third case the second mobile device may have access to a Wi Fi access point unavailable to at least some other mobile devices.

In a fourth case a cellular data allocation for the second mobile device from a cellular data subscription or pre paid cellular data purchase may have a significant amount remaining. In particular the cellular data allocation may be time limited as is common with a cellular data subscription expiring at the end of a monthly billing period with a new allocation provided in the new billing period. As such the second mobile device may have cellular data allocation that a usage history for the device indicates will not be used solely based on the behavior of the second mobile device . The sharing authority which may include the support of a local application on the second mobile device may analyze the usage history of the second mobile device compare it to a remaining cellular data allocation for the second mobile device and determine that a prediction of future usage based on the usage history indicates that cellular data allocation will remain and be wasted at the end of a billing period. The sharing authority may therefore promote network sharing to the second mobile device in response to this determination along with a notification of the prediction of wasted cellular data allocation.

In some cases the second mobile device may initiate an exchange of second sharing information with the sharing authority to determine whether any opportunities exist to gain sharing credits by sharing its network connection. For example where a local application on the second mobile device determines that excess cellular data allocation is predicted to exist for the second mobile device the local application may in some embodiments after consultation with the user of the device inquire as to sharing opportunities to make use of the excess cellular data allocation. In other cases the sharing authority may initiate an exchange of second sharing information with the second mobile device to determine whether the second mobile device will share its network connection in return for sharing credit. For example the sharing authority may receive a request from another mobile device to benefit from a shared connection and contact devices in the proximity of the other mobile device to determine whether any are in a position to and have an interest in sharing their connection.

Sharing a network connection between a first mobile device and a second mobile device may include the exchange of peer to peer signals . Peer to peer signals may comprise the direct exchange of radio transmission between the two mobile devices without the use of an intermediary transceiver distinct from the devices. The peer to peer signals may conform to a peer to peer protocol such as Wi Fi Direct or Bluetooth. The peer to peer signals may comprise one of the first and second mobile devices connecting to a Wi Fi hotspot created by the other of the first and second mobile devices . The peer to peer signals may conform to any known technique for generating a peer to peer radio connection. The peer to peer signals may empower the first mobile device to use the second mobile device as a proxy to access Internet resources. For example the first mobile device may communicate with a network server using the second mobile device as a proxy.

In some embodiments peer to peer signals may be used for the discovery of mobile devices willing to share their connection and mobile devices interested in benefiting from a shared connection. Various known techniques for local discovery may be used including Wi Fi techniques and Bluetooth techniques. In some embodiments a second mobile device interested in receiving sharing credit in return for providing network sharing may create a Wi Fi hotspot with a broadcast name of the Wi Fi hotspot containing an identifier for its participation in the peer to peer network sharing system and allowing limited connections for the purpose of negotiating a credit for sharing agreement.

The use of solid lines for the first cellular signals second cellular signals first Wi Fi signals second Wi Fi signals and peer to peer signals may indicate that these signals comprise direct wireless communication between the depicted entities. For example the first cellular signals may be transmitted by the first mobile device and received by a transceiver of the first cellular system and vice versa and similarly for the other signals depicted with solid lines. In contrast the use of dashed lines may indicate that while communication is between the connected entities that the entities may not be communicating without the involvement of other entities. For instance first sharing information may be communicated between the first mobile device and the sharing authority but relayed through the first cellular system . Similarly second sharing information may be communicated between the second mobile device and the sharing authority but be relayed through the second cellular system or Wi Fi access point .

The mobile devices and or the sharing authority may use knowledge generated from interactions in a social networking service. As such peer to peer network sharing system may include an authorization server or other suitable component s that allows users to opt in to or opt out of having their actions logged by the peer to peer network sharing system or shared with other systems e.g. third party systems for example by setting appropriate privacy settings. A privacy setting of a user may determine what information associated with the user may be logged how information associated with the user may be logged when information associated with the user may be logged who may log information associated with the user whom information associated with the user may be shared with and for what purposes information associated with the user may be logged or shared. Authorization servers or other authorization components may be used to enforce one or more privacy settings of the users of the peer to peer network sharing system and other elements of a social networking system through blocking data hashing anonymization or other suitable techniques as appropriate.

The mobile devices may execute local applications on behalf of a user of the devices. The first mobile device may execute local applications . The local applications may comprise one or more networked applications that may use network activity as part of their operation. One or more of the local applications may comprise web browsers.

The first mobile device and second mobile device may both comprise a local proxy component . The local proxy component may be registered with an operating system OS of first and second mobile devices to act as a network interface for the first and second mobile devices . The first and second mobile devices may include a plurality of network interfaces such as a cellular network interface a Wi Fi network interface a Bluetooth network interface and any other known network interfaces. These network interfaces may be categorized and prioritized for use with various apps running on the first and second mobile devices . The local proxy component may be configured as a default network interface for local applications such that the local proxy component is used in preference over the cellular network interface Wi Fi network interface or any other network interface. The local proxy component may then select from among the other network interfaces of the first and second mobile devices for the transmission and reception of network traffic out of the first and second mobile devices and reception of network traffic into the first and second mobile devices transmitting and receiving across one or more of the other network interfaces of the first and second mobile devices that provide external network connectivity. The local proxy component may thereby serve as a gateway between the local applications and the one or more external networks to which the first and second mobile devices can connect. By serving as a gateway the local proxy component may be operative to perform communication requests on behalf of local applications .

Submitting a communication request to the local proxy component may comprise using a network interface application programming interface API generally providing access to networks accessible to the devices. For instance the operating system of the first and second mobile devices may automatically select a network interface from a plurality of network interfaces according to a priority of the network interfaces. The local proxy component may be the highest priority network interface of the plurality of network interfaces. In some embodiments local applications using local proxy component may first be registered with the operating system or local proxy component before the local proxy component is a prioritized network interface for the local applications . A user of a mobile device may have to opt in to a privacy policy associated with local proxy component prior to local proxy component being used as a network interface for local applications .

Any or all of local applications may submit communication requests to the local proxy component . Any of the communication requests of any of the local applications may comprise a network transaction carried out by the local proxy component of the first mobile device using the local proxy component of the second mobile device as a proxy to communicate with a network server .

The local proxy component of the first mobile device may receive a network request from one of the local applications executed by the first mobile device . The local proxy component of the first mobile device may transmit the network request to the local proxy component of the second mobile device . The local proxy component of the second mobile device may then forward the network request to the network server to which it is addressed. If the network server responds the response may be transmitted by the network server to the local proxy component of the second mobile device . The local proxy component of the second mobile device may then forward the response to the local proxy component of the first mobile device . The local proxy component of the first mobile device may then provide the response to the application of the local application that initiated the network request. All of this exchange may comprise a network transaction carried out. The local proxy component of the first mobile device may generally operate as a local proxy for the local applications of the first mobile device . The local proxy component of the second mobile device may generally operate as a remote proxy for the first mobile device .

Where the network transaction described with reference to uses end to end encryption between the first mobile device and the network server the second mobile device may be unable to snoop on the contents of the network transaction . However many network transactions may be unencrypted. A user of the first mobile device may have some comfort in performing unencrypted network activity using the cellular system because it may have a trust relationship with the operator of the cellular system . However the user of the second mobile device may be unknown to the user of the first mobile device and the user of the first mobile device may not be willing to extend any trust to the user of the second mobile device . As such the user of the first mobile device may benefit from having the network transaction tunneled through an encrypted connection .

The user of the first mobile device may have a trust relationship with the sharing authority . The user of the first mobile device may be willing to allow the sharing authority to process an unencrypted network transaction on its behalf. As such the local proxy component of the first mobile device may established an encrypted connection with a remote proxy component for the sharing authority such as a remote proxy component executed by a proxy server device for the sharing authority . Various techniques for establishing an encrypted connection may be used including without limitation virtual private network VPN techniques private public encrypted techniques using a public key for the sharing authority known to the local proxy component or any other known technique for creating an encrypted connection being transmitted via an untrusted intermediary such as the second mobile device .

The local proxy component of the first mobile device may establish an encrypted connection between the local proxy component and the remote proxy component . The encrypted connection may be retransmitted via the local proxy component of the second mobile device but without the local proxy component able to decrypt the contents of the encrypted connection . The encrypted connection may carry the network transaction described with reference to within it with the remote proxy component performing the unencrypted network transaction with the network server as a proxy for the first mobile device .

The sharing operations for a mobile device within the peer to peer sharing system may be managed locally on each mobile device by a sharing control component . The sharing control component may be generally arranged to manage both the providing and reception of network sharing and to communicate with a user of the device as to control over the providing and reception of network sharing. Each of the first and second mobile devices may execute an instantiation of the sharing control component . In some embodiments the sharing control component and the local proxy component may be part of a local gateway application on the mobile devices .

The sharing control component on the first mobile device may transmit an offer from the first mobile device to the second mobile device . The offer may be for the second mobile device to act as a proxy for the first mobile device for the performance of network services in return for a transfer of sharing credit from a first account to a second account with a sharing authority . This first account may be associated with the first mobile device and this second account associated with the second mobile device . Users of each of the first and second mobile devices may have registered their respective mobile devices with their respective accounts with the sharing authority . The sharing control component may receive an offer acceptance from the sharing control component of the second mobile device .

In some embodiments the first and second mobile devices may communicate directly using peer to peer signals . In other embodiments the first and second mobile devices may communicate via the sharing authority . In some embodiments the offer may be evaluated according to sharing criteria for the second mobile device registered with the sharing authority the sharing criteria comprising at least a portion of the sharing information . For example the second mobile device may register the minimum amount of sharing credit it is willing to accept for providing sharing services to other mobile devices with the offer compared to this minimum amount to determine whether the offer is acceptable. In some embodiments the offer acceptance may be performed automatically by the sharing authority in response to an offer meeting the minimum acceptance criteria for the second mobile device . In other embodiments an offer meeting the minimum acceptable criteria for the second mobile device may still be forwarded to the second mobile device in order to determine whether the sharing control component still believes that the second mobile device is an appropriate state to performing network sharing e.g. sufficient network bandwidth sufficient power etc. and or to receive approval from a user of the second mobile device .

The offer acceptance may be received from the second mobile device in response to a prediction by the second mobile device that a cellular data allocation for cellular data service for the second mobile device has excess capacity for an allocation period. Such a prediction may also be used by the second mobile device to initiate advertising of proxying availability to other devices and through the sharing authority .

In response to the offer acceptance the local proxy component of the first mobile device may receive configuration information from the sharing control component and configure the first mobile device to use the second mobile device as a network proxy using the configuration information . The configuration information may be received as part of the offer acceptance . The configuration information may include information for establishing a peer to peer connection comprising peer to peer signals . The first mobile device using the second mobile device as a proxy may comprise without limitation at least one of the first mobile device connecting to a Wi Fi hotspot created by the second mobile device the first mobile device creating a Wi Fi hotspot at the first mobile device for the second mobile device to connect to creating a direct Wi Fi connection between the first mobile device and the second mobile device and creating a Bluetooth connection between the first mobile device and the second mobile device .

The sharing control component may prompt the user of the first mobile device that they may wish to use a proxy for network access based on a variety of criteria. The sharing control component may determine that a cellular data allocation for a cellular data account for the first mobile device is below a threshold amount and display a notification of available sharing services to the user of the first mobile device in response to determining that the cellular data allocation for the cellular data account for the first mobile device is below the threshold amount. The sharing control component may determine that the first mobile device does not have a cellular data allocation for a geographic region in which the first mobile device is operating and display a notification of available sharing services to a user of the first mobile device in response to determining that the first mobile device does not have the cellular data allocation for the geographic region in which the first mobile device is operating. The sharing control component may determine that the second mobile device has a higher quality network connection available than the first mobile device and display a notification of available sharing services to a user of the first mobile device in response to determining that the second mobile device has the higher quality network connection available. In some cases multiple of these determinations may be made and displayed to the user of the first mobile device in combination with each other. These determinations may be displayed in association with a sharing credit amount asked by the second mobile device and or a reliability rating for the second mobile device .

In some cases the offer may be transmitted as part of an auction held for a receipt of network proxy services from the second mobile device . The sharing authority may determine that multiple devices proximate to a second mobile device would like to receive the benefit of proxy services from the second mobile device the number of proximate mobile devices in excess of a number appropriate to receiving proxy services from the second mobile devices . The sharing authority may therefore initiate an auction among the multiple proximate mobile devices to bid for the services of the second mobile device . The sharing authority may select one or more proximate mobile devices with the highest bid s notify the second mobile device with the offer acceptance comprising an acceptance of a bid corresponding to the offer . In some embodiments the auction may comprise multiple rounds of bidding. Any known techniques for auctions may be used including Vickrey auctions.

The user of the first mobile device may transfer sharing credit from their user account to a user account for the user of the second mobile device in order to compensate the user of the second mobile device for the user of their mobile device and their network connection. The sharing control component may authorize the transfer of sharing credit from the first account to the second account with the sharing authority using security credentials for the first account. Using security credentials may comprise encrypting at least a portion of the transfer authorization with the security credentials e.g. a private key to prove that the sharing control component for the first mobile device has authorized the transfer.

In some cases the transfer authorization may be transmitted to the sharing authority using the proxy provided by the second mobile device . In other cases such as where the second mobile device refuses to offer proxy services until compensated the transfer authorization may be transmitted without use of the second mobile device such as through the first cellular system . In some cases the second mobile device may allow through connections to a sharing management component of the sharing authority to allow the performance of the transfer authorization . This may serve to minimize or eliminate the use of a network connection to the Internet for the first mobile device other than the one provided by the second mobile device .

Sharing credit may be represented with the sharing authority according to a variety of schema. Each account with the sharing authority may have associated with a delineated quantity of sharing credits that the user has accumulated with the sharing authority . In one case the sharing credit used by the first mobile device to pay for the sharing services of the second mobile device may have been generated with the sharing authority based on a previous session of the first mobile device wherein the first mobile device provided network proxy services to a third mobile device in the previous session. In another case the user of the first mobile device may have purchased the sharing credit using money. In some embodiments the user may be able to purchase sharing credits created by the sharing authority . In other embodiments the user may only be able to purchase sharing credits from another user of the sharing authority via the sharing authority so as to reduce inflation of sharing credits. In general the sharing authority may be empowered to manage a market for sharing credits.

In some embodiments the sharing authority may contribute sharing credits to a user s account or contribute part of a sharing cost for using a second mobile device based on the user of the first mobile device viewing advertisements. In some of these embodiments the advertisements may be inserted into the network activity performed by the second mobile device on behalf of the first mobile device so as to be viewed during the receipt of proxy services. For example the user of the first mobile device may be displayed advertisements provided by the sharing authority during a web browsing session carried out during the proxy services the advertisements inserted into the web browsing session by the sharing authority in return for the sharing authority paying at least a portion of the sharing credits paid to the user account of the second mobile device .

Sharing credits may be paid according to a variety of schema. An offer and acceptance of sharing credits may be for a specific amount of sharing credits in return for a specific amount of time a specific amount of bandwidth or according to some other measure of network usage. In some cases the offer and acceptance may be for a certain amount of sharing credit for each unit of time e.g. minute 5 minute period etc. or bandwidth e.g. KB MB GB used. It will be appreciated that the peer to peer network sharing system may offer a variety of sharing agreements that may be entered into by users.

The sharing authority may transmit a transfer notification to the second mobile device the transfer notification authenticating to the second mobile device that the first user account for the first mobile device has transferred the agreed to sharing credits to the second user account. Where increments of time are purchased a series of transfer authorizations and transfer notifications may be used to maintain authorization for credit transfer and to provide notice of the transfer so as to keep the shared connection available to the first mobile device .

The sharing control component may identify that the user of the first mobile device may benefit from receiving proxy services to share a network connection of another device. The sharing control component identifying this possibility may comprise a determination of a poor network connection for the first mobile device a determination that the network connection for the first mobile device is using a cellular system for which the first mobile device has little cellular data allocation remaining a determination that the network connection for the first mobile device is using a cellular system for which the first mobile device has no cellular data allocation or according to any other indication that the user may benefit from a network proxy provided by a nearby mobile device. In some cases the user of the first mobile device may manually request that a proxy be found.

The sharing control component may perform a proxy query in response to the identification. The sharing control component may receive a proxy availability notification in response. In some cases the proxy query may be performed with the sharing authority . The sharing control component may receive a proxy availability notification for the second mobile device from the sharing authority at the first mobile device the proxy availability notification comprising connection information for transmitting an offer to the second mobile device . The proxy availability received from the sharing authority may have been initially provided to the sharing authority from the second mobile device as at least part of the second mobile device advertising its willingness to provide proxy services. Alternatively in some cases the sharing control component may broadcast a proxy query locally and receive the proxy availability directly from the second mobile device in response. Alternatively in other cases the second mobile device may broadcast the proxy availability locally without being prompted by the first mobile device to advertise its willingness to provide proxy services in return for sharing credit.

The sharing authority may select a particular second mobile device according to a variety of criteria. For instance the first mobile device may specify an amount it is willing to pay and the second mobile device may specify an amount it demands to be paid. The proxy availability may comprise only those mobile devices that would accept the amount the first mobile device would be willing to pay. The proxy query may comprise a location of the first mobile device to inform the sharing authority of what location mobile devices must be in for it to be able to receive their services. Similarly a proxy availability transmitted to the sharing authority by the second mobile device may comprise a location of the second mobile device to information the sharing authority of what location it can provide network sharing in.

In some cases the second mobile device may be selected according to an available amount of cellular data allocation for a cellular data account for the second mobile device . The sharing authority may be operative to direct a first mobile device to a second mobile device with the most or a particularly large amount of cellular data allocation remaining. The sharing authority may for example be willing to ask a user with a particularly large amount of cellular data allocation remaining whether they would accept a bid for sharing credit in return for receiving proxy services that is below their normal threshold due to the extent of the cellular data allocation remaining. Similarly where a second mobile device has not specified an amount demanded the sharing authority may ask the user of the second mobile device whether they would be interested in sharing their network connection in return for sharing credit based on the extent of their cellular data allocation remaining.

The proxy query may comprise a query by the first mobile device to the second account for a sharing credit amount asked for acting as a proxy. Upon receiving the proxy availability the sharing control component may display the sharing credit amount asked to a user of the first mobile device in association with a notification of available sharing services. The sharing control component may receive a user selection to initiate the available sharing services in response to the displaying notification of available sharing services displayed in association with the sharing credit amount.

In some cases the sharing authority may include mobile devices that are out of range of the first mobile device but that are close enough to be in range if the first mobile device were to travel a short distance. For example the user of the first mobile device may be willing to move to a different location in an airport while waiting for a flight in order to receive network services from a second mobile device . The sharing authority may be operative to guide or instruct the user of the first mobile device as to where to go to be within range of the second mobile device .

In some cases the sharing system may generate and provide a reliability rating for users of the peer to peer networking sharing system . The reliability rating for a user account may represent a reliability of a user of the second account in providing proxy services. The reliability rating may be based on previous proxy services provided by the second mobile device such as whether the second mobile device reliably performs proxy services for other devices. The reliability rating may include an evaluation of the network connection of the second mobile device . The sharing control component of the first mobile device may therefore query the sharing authority for a reliability rating of the second account and receive the reliability rating of the second account from the sharing authority . The sharing control component may display the reliability rating to a user of the first mobile device in association with a notification of available sharing services and receive a user selection to initiate the available sharing services based on the notification that included the reliability rating .

In some embodiments the reliability rating may be generated based at least in part on social networking information for the user of the second account from a social networking service . A social networking service may have access to significant information regarding the reliability of a user. The social networking service may be able to evaluate the reliability of a user in a broader social context apart from network services provided by the second mobile device . The social networking information may be combined with reliability information generated from the providing of proxy services by the second mobile device to generate the reliability rating .

In some cases the reliability rating may be received by the first mobile device from the second mobile device over a peer to peer connection. The reliability rating may be digitally signed by the sharing authority to verify the sharing authority as the source of the reliability rating . The second mobile device may be empowered to cache the digitally signed reliability rating and to provide it to other devices so as to advertise its reliability without requiring a round trip to the sharing authority . The digitally signed reliability rating may include a timestamp to allow the sharing control component of the first mobile device to verify that the reliability rating is sufficiently recent.
