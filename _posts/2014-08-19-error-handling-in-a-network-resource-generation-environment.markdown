This application is a continuation of and claims priority to co pending U.S. patent application entitled ERROR HANDLING IN A NETWORK PAGE GENERATION ENVIRONMENT filed on Feb. 1 2012 and assigned application Ser. No. 13 363 782 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards PCI DSS and or other security standards may present challenges for online merchants. For this and other reasons online merchants may elect to have their electronic commerce platform managed by a third party electronic commerce hosting provider who ensures compliance with the security standards. However merchants may lose flexibility in customizing or configuring their network sites when using such a hosted solution as compared with a self managed solution.

The present disclosure relates to providing error handling in a network page generation environment having a hosted framework. A hosting provider may offer network site hosting for a plurality of customers. Such hosting may include access to an electronic commerce platform or other hosted application. For security and other various reasons customer supplied network page generation code may be executed under a framework that restricts the operations permitted in the code. Also the page generation code may be restricted from directly accessing data sources of the electronic commerce platform. To provide access data from the electronic commerce platform that is used by the page generation code may be aggregated from one or more data sources in advance for use by the page generation code.

Various techniques relating to a data aggregation framework are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 348 051 entitled GENERATING NETWORK PAGES USING CUSTOMER SUPPLIED GENERATION CODE and filed on Jan. 11 2012 and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 348 059 entitled GENERATING NETWORK PAGES USING CUSTOMER GENERATED NETWORK PAGE PORTIONS and filed on Jan. 11 2012 both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

Errors may occur in the data aggregation or elsewhere in the network page generation environment for a variety of reasons. Such errors may be internal server errors and or other types of errors. For security and or other reasons the customer supplied page generation code may be restricted from including exception handling code. Nonetheless it is desirable to allow customers to customize error messages for their particular network sites to provide a consistent user experience and for other reasons.

Various embodiments of the present disclosure facilitate error handling of framework generated errors and or other errors. Customers of a hosting provider may provide and or configure error page generation code to generate customized error pages. Further for non fatal errors e.g. if a certain data item could not be obtained during data aggregation etc. error indications may be provided to the customer supplied page generation code to facilitate error handling. In the following discussion a general description of the system and its components is provided followed by a discussion of the operation of the same.

With reference to shown is a networked environment according to various embodiments. The networked environment includes a computing environment in data communication with one or more clients by way of a network . The network includes for example the Internet intranets extranets wide area networks WANs local area networks LANs wired networks wireless networks or other suitable networks etc. or any combination of two or more such networks.

The computing environment may comprise for example a server computer or any other system providing computing capability. Alternatively a plurality of computing devices may be employed that are arranged for example in one or more server banks or computer banks or other arrangements. For example a plurality of computing devices together may comprise a cloud computing resource a grid computing resource and or any other distributed computing arrangement. Such computing devices may be located in a single installation or may be distributed among many different geographical locations. The computing environment may be operated by a hosting provider to host network sites for various customers.

Various applications and or other functionality may be executed in the computing environment according to various embodiments. Also various data is stored in a data store that is accessible to the computing environment . The data store may be representative of a plurality of data stores as can be appreciated. The data stored in the data store for example is associated with the operation of the various applications and or functional entities described below.

The components executed by the computing environment for example include a plurality of data sources . . . N a data aggregation service a network page generation application a network page server application a network site configuration application and other applications services processes systems engines or functionality not discussed in detail herein. The data sources are executed to provide various data used in generating network pages for network sites of customers of the hosting provider. Where the customers are merchants the data provided by the data sources may relate to electronic commerce data such as for example item catalog data item suggestions data shopping cart data checkout data order data and so on. In one embodiment the data sources may comprise web services. In another embodiment the data sources may comprise files or other forms of data stores.

The data aggregation service is executed to aggregate data from the data sources for use in generation of network pages . The data aggregation service may employ parallel fetching to reduce latency when data is aggregated from multiple data sources . The network page generation application is executed to generate the network pages in response to page requests obtained from clients . The network pages may correspond to web pages gopher pages mobile application screens and or other forms of network content. Where the customer is a merchant the network pages may correspond to home pages catalog pages item detail pages shopping cart pages checkout pages order confirmation pages and so on. Such network pages may facilitate selecting items for purchase rental download lease or other form of consumption. In addition where the customer is a merchant the network page generation application may include or be in communication with an electronic commerce system that performs various backend functions in order to facilitate the online purchase of items.

The network page generation application may execute page generation code in order to generate the network pages . The page generation code may correspond to a default version supplied by the hosting provider or may correspond to a customized version supplied by the customer. In some cases the page generation code may be transformed or compiled from one code format to another and or may be interpreted. As a non limiting example the page generation code may correspond to JavaServer Pages JSPs which may be compiled into Java servlets which in turn may be compiled into bytecode which may be executable by the network page generation application . To this end the network page generation application may include a servlet container such as Apache Tomcat or another servlet container.

The network page generation application may be configured to obtain aggregated data from the data aggregation service and to provide the aggregated data to the page generation code for example as a set of predefined variables or by another approach. The network page generation application may act as a sandbox for the page generation code to enforce restrictions on application programming interface API calls access to the data source and or other resources in the computing environment .

The network page generation application may execute error page generation code in response to detecting framework originated errors to generate error network pages . The error page generation code may correspond to a default version supplied by the hosting provider or may correspond to a customized version supplied by the customer. The error network pages may be generated in place of the requested network page when some unrecoverable error occurs. Such an error may originate for example in the data aggregation phase or in the network page generation phase. For example the errors may correspond to hypertext transfer protocol HTTP errors such as an internal server error error code a service unavailable error error code a forbidden error error code a file not found error error code and or other HTTP errors. In some cases the error page generation code may be transformed or compiled from one code format to another and or may be interpreted. As a non limiting example the error page generation code may correspond to JSPs which may be compiled into Java servlets which in turn may be compiled into bytecode which may be executable by the network page generation application .

The network page server application is configured to obtain the page requests from the client over the network to generate network pages or error network pages if an error occurs in response to the page requests using the network page generation application and to return the network pages to the client by way of the network . The network page server application may correspond to a commercially available HTTP server such as for example Apache HTTP Server Apache Tomcat Microsoft Internet Information Services IIS and or other servers.

The network site configuration application is executed to facilitate customer configuration of network sites. To this end the network site configuration application may enable uploading and configuration of the page generation code configuration of various parameters associated with the operation of the network site order fulfillment management item catalog management and or other functionality. The network site configuration application may implement an HTTP server a web based distributed authoring and versioning WebDAV server a file transfer protocol FTP server and or other servers.

The data stored in the data store includes for example network site data network site configuration data customized page generation code default page generation code stored error page generation code page generation restrictions and potentially other data. The network site data corresponds to data used in the generation of the network pages for the hosted network sites of the merchants or other customers. Such data may include for example templates hypertext markup language HTML text extensible markup language XML cascading style sheets CSS images audio video animations and or other data.

The network site configuration data may store parameters and or other data for controlling the operation and appearance of the hosted network site. Such data may control various electronic commerce functionality such as for example item catalogs item taxonomies item searching item recommendations shopping carts checkout order fulfillment and or other functionality. The customized page generation code corresponds to page generation code which is created or customized by merchants or other customers. The default page generation code may correspond to a default set of page generation code for a merchant or other customer to use for a base functionality for a network site. The default page generation code may generate network pages having for example a default appearance and behavior for a generic electronic commerce site.

The stored error page generation code corresponds to the error page generation code that may be configured and customized by the customer for use in handling errors on a hosted network site. In some cases the stored error page generation code may correspond to default code supplied by the hosting provider. The page generation restrictions may configure various restrictions to be placed on the page generation code by the network page generation application . As a non limiting example where the page generation code corresponds to JSP code the network page generation application may restrict the JSP code from including scriptlets and or various API calls. Various functionalities may be whitelisted or blacklisted as the case may be. Such restrictions may be configured by way of parameters in the page generation restrictions .

The client is representative of a plurality of client devices that may be coupled to the network . The client may comprise for example a processor based system such as a computer system. Such a computer system may be embodied in the form of a desktop computer a laptop computer personal digital assistants cellular telephones smartphones set top boxes music players web pads tablet computer systems game consoles electronic book readers or other devices with like capability. The client may include a display . The display may comprise for example one or more devices such as cathode ray tubes CRTs liquid crystal display LCD screens gas plasma based flat panel displays LCD projectors or other types of display devices etc.

The client may be configured to execute various applications such as a browser and or other applications. The browser may be executed in a client for example to access and render network pages served up by the computing environment and or other servers thereby generating a rendered network page on the display . The client may be configured to execute applications beyond the browser such as for example code development applications file transfer applications mobile applications email applications instant message applications and or other applications.

Next a general description of the operation of the various components of the networked environment is provided. To begin a merchant or other customer of a hosting provider associated with the computing environment configures a network site to be hosted through the computing environment . The network site may have a common domain that is shared by multiple customers of the hosting provider or the network site may correspond to a unique domain for each customer. The merchant or other customer may adopt default page generation code for various network pages accessible through the network site. Alternatively or additionally the merchant or other customer may create customized page generation code for generating some or all of the network pages accessible through the network site.

The merchant or other customer may interact with the network site configuration application to customize or make changes to the network site. In various cases the customer may edit the page generation code directly through the network site configuration application or the customer may upload replacement page generation code . Through this system customers are able to control generation of network pages for their network sites despite using a hosted infrastructure and potentially a hosted electronic commerce platform.

Additionally the merchant or other customer may create or customize the stored error page generation code for use in handling errors originating in the data aggregation and code execution framework and or other code outside of the control of the customer. The customer may establish mappings of various error codes e.g. HTTP error codes or other error codes to particular files or sets of the stored error page generation code . Such configuration parameters may be stored in the network site configuration data . As a non limiting example the customer may configure a specific JSP file in the stored error page generation code for handling internal server errors having HTTP error code . The JSP file may include a customized layout with graphics and formatting that maintain the same or similar look and feel from the network site of the customer. The JSP file may include a customized error message which may be more helpful and provide an enhanced user experience over that of a generic internal server error message.

The page generation code is able to access the aggregated data generated by the data aggregation service by way of predefined variables . In some cases the page generation code may declare various data that it accesses which is then aggregated by the data aggregation service . In other cases the data aggregation service may provide a standard set of data from the data sources . The set of data may depend on the type of network page e.g. whether the network page is a checkout page catalog page order confirmation page and so on. In one example the aggregated data may be associated with the hosted electronic commerce platform provided by the hosting provider. The predefined variables may be provided to the page generation code by way of implicit variables or other variables that are available in the scope of the page generation code . The page generation code may be configured to use all of the predefined variables or a subset of the predefined variables . The page generation code may be restricted from accessing the data sources directly.

Some errors may occur in the data aggregation phase and or otherwise may be non fatal to the execution of the page generation code . Upon such recoverable errors the network page generation application may be configured to set an error indication in a predefined variable . As a non limiting example page generation code supplied by a customer may expect to access a certain predefined variable containing a shopping cart representation cart. Suppose there is an error in obtaining the shopping cart by the data aggregation service . Consequently cart may be set to a null value and another predefined variable of error.cart may be set to an error identifier that indicates that a shopping cart has not yet been created. When generating the network page the page generation code can verify whether the value of cart is null. If the value is null and if the value of error.cart is set to an error identifier the page generation code may be able to recover from the error and generate a display region for example indicating that the shopping cart is considered to be empty because no items have been added to it.

In operation the client sends a page request to the network page server application for some network page from a network site of a customer. The network site is hosted on behalf of the customer by the hosting provider who operates the computing environment . Where the customer is a merchant the hosting provider may operate a hosted electronic commerce platform in conjunction with the computing environment . The page request is provided to the network page generation application which then obtains the aggregated data from the data aggregation service . The aggregation may be performed automatically in response to the page request or in advance of the page request . The data aggregation service fetches the aggregated data from one or more data sources . If a recoverable error occurs in this data aggregation an error indication may be page generation code by one or more predefined variables e.g. error etc. .

The page generation code for the requested network page is executed by the network page generation application . The network page generation application facilitates access to the predefined variables by the page generation code . The page generation code generates the network page and the network page server application serves up the network page to the client in response to the page request .

If any non recoverable error occurs in the framework e.g. the data aggregation service a JVM a servlet container components of the network page generation application and so on the network page generation application may abort the generation of the network page . Instead if so configured the network page generation application may execute error page generation code that has been supplied or customized by the customer for the network site of the customer in order to generate an error network page . Which error page generation code is selected may depend at least in part on the type of error. As a non limiting example a customer may configure different error page generation code e.g. different JSP files etc. to be used for an HTTP 404 error versus an HTTP 500 error. The error network page is sent to the client in response to the page request in place of the network page .

Such error handling may be used for any error in the framework that causes an interruption in processing for the page generation code . Such errors may be framework errors and non customer caused errors. Such errors may ordinarily result in a generic error message established by the hosting provider which may be discordant with an otherwise consistent user experience of the network site of the customer. The use of the error page generation code as described herein allows the customer to customize error messages which may be caused by code outside of the control of the customer to fit with a consistent user experience.

In some embodiments the page generation code is restricted from accessing one or more of the data sources . The customer supplied page generation code may be isolated from one or more of the data sources for purposes of complying with PCI DSS and or other security standards. Consequently the data from the data sources may be accessible only as aggregated data provided by the data aggregation service as predefined variables . It is noted that the data aggregation service may generate the aggregated data in response to the page request in response to other events or at other times as desired. In some scenarios the data aggregation service may be configured to provide aggregated data to the error page generation code as predefined variables .

The page generation code and or the error page generation code may be analyzed for compliance with one or more policies according to the page generation restrictions when initially configured or compiled and or at runtime. Such policies may include acceptable content of the network page API usage usage of scriptlets or other disallowed language features and so on. The page generation restrictions may specify that no exception handling code is permitted in the page generation code or the error page generation code . If the page generation code and or the error page generation code are determined to be non compliant the page generation code and or the error page generation code may be unexecuted terminated if already executing replaced with default page generation code or another action may be taken.

Turning now to shown is a flowchart that provides one example of the operation of a portion of the network site configuration application according to the embodiments discussed in connection with .

Beginning with box the network site configuration application obtains page generation code from a customer whose network site is hosted by the hosting provider who operates the computing environment . The page generation code may correspond to error page generation code in some cases. The network site configuration application may be configured to authenticate a client associated with the customer. In box the network site configuration application determines whether the page generation code is valid. If the page generation code is not valid the network site configuration application rejects the page generation code in box . An error may be presented to the customer. Thereafter the portion of the network site configuration application ends.

If the page generation code is valid the network site configuration application proceeds from box to box . Even assuming that the page generation code is determined to be valid by the network site configuration application validity checks may still need to be performed by the network page generation application at runtime. In box the network site configuration application compiles the page generation code . For example the network site configuration application may compile the page generation code from a JSP into a servlet. The resulting servlet code may also be compiled into bytecode for execution by a Java Virtual Machine JVM or directly by a processor circuit of the computing environment .

In box the network site configuration application determines whether the customer has supplied error page generation code . If the customer has supplied error page generation code the network site configuration application moves from box to box and configures the network page generation application to use the customer supplied error page generation code for handling one or more types of errors. The network site configuration application may also compile the error page generation code . The network site configuration application then moves to box .

If the network site configuration application instead determines that the customer has not supplied error page generation code the network site configuration application proceeds from box to box . In box the network site configuration application configures the network page generation application to use default error page generation code . The network site configuration application then moves to box . In box the network site configuration application configures the network page generation application to execute the compiled page generation code for one or more network pages for the network site of the customer. In box the network site configuration application may store configuration data that configures the data aggregation service to provide a set of aggregated data to the page generation code as predefined variables . In some cases error page generation code may also be configured to use aggregated data. Thereafter the portion of the network site configuration application ends.

In box the network page generation application aggregates various data pertaining to the customer from one or more data sources by way of the data aggregation service .

In box the network page generation application executes the page generation code . In doing so the network page generation application may perform various runtime checks to ensure that the page generation code does not include any impermissible code or content. In box the network page generation application determines whether an error has occurred. Such an error may relate to data aggregation data unavailability code execution system resources and or other components in the hosted network site framework. If no error has occurred the network page generation application continues from box to box . In box the network page generation application provides the aggregated data to the page generation code as predefined variables .

In box the network page generation application assembles the network page using the output of the page generation code and potentially other data. In box the network page generation application sends the generated network page to the client in response to the page request . Thereafter the portion of the network page generation application ends.

If instead the network page generation application determines that an error has occurred the network page generation application proceeds from box to box . In box the network page generation application determines whether the error is a recoverable error that is non fatal to the execution of the page generation code . If the error is a recoverable error the network page generation application moves from box to box . In box the network page generation application provides an error indication to the page generation code by way of a predefined variable . Multiple error indications may be provided corresponding to multiple errors that have been identified. The page generation code may be configured internally to handle errors that are detected in response to the error indications. The network page generation application then proceeds to box .

In box the network page generation application provides the aggregated data to the page generation code as predefined variables . In box the network page generation application assembles the network page using the output of the page generation code and potentially other data. In box the network page generation application sends the generated network page to the client in response to the page request . Thereafter the portion of the network page generation application ends.

If the error is determined to be a non recoverable error in box the network page generation application instead transitions to box . The execution of the page generation code may be terminated in response to the non recoverable error. In box the network page generation application obtains corresponding error page generation code that is configured to handle the error from the stored error page generation code . Such error page generation code may correspond to customer supplied error page generation code or default error page generation code . In box the network page generation application executes the error page generation code to generate an error network page . In box the network page generation application sends the error network page to the client . Thereafter the portion of the network page generation application ends.
