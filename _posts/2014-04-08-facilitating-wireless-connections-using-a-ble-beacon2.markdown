Embodiments disclosed herein are related to systems and methods for facilitating wireless connections using a Bluetooth low energy BLE beacon.

Due to the increase in use of mobile devices and the improved networking and online capabilities of these mobile devices merchants having physical brick and mortar storefronts may also have mechanisms for delivering advertisements and other information to the mobile devices while a user of the mobile device is in the merchant store. Some merchants may take advantage of platforms and services that allow a user to check in to the merchant or other location that they are in to deliver advertisements specials and other information. This allows the merchant to know that the user is at the store and provide specials and other information to the user. If the user is checking in via a social network the user may also provide feedback about the merchant which may be useful or helpful for the merchant. If the user is checking in via a payment processing service such as provided by PayPal Inc. or San Jose Calif. the user may be provided with options for selecting ordering and paying for items through the payment processing service when checking in providing convenience for both the user and the merchant. In theory checking provides benefits for both the user and the merchant. However the users may have to perform the tedious process of checking in every time that they visit the merchant. And if the user does not check in on every visit then neither the user nor the merchant fully benefits from checking in. Further if the user has limited data connectivity while at the merchant location due to poor cellular reception the user may not be able to check in and or receive any benefits associated with the check in.

In the following description specific details are set forth describing certain embodiments. It will be apparent however to one skilled in the art that the disclosed embodiments may be practiced without some or all of these specific details.

Further BLE beacon may have a design such as shown in U.S. Design Application No. 29 455 720 filed May 23 2013 the entire contents of which are also incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

As will be readily appreciated the foregoing networks systems devices methods and variations thereof can be used to implement an automated check in of users at a cooperating or subscribing establishment such that subsequent purchase transactions and other activities can be more streamlined and convenient.

Merchant location includes an indoor store floor having a number of beacons and access points . In some embodiments beacons may be BLE beacons and access points may be wireless access points WAPs . These devices can be distributed strategically throughout merchant location such as near the front door at central locations and or at locations of high volume traffic within the establishment. One or more client computing devices can interact with one or more of the beacons throughout location . Preferably only one interaction with a beacon is needed for a check in although it may be useful for an establishment to know where user is located and or where user travels and shopping patterns or habits within location . Such further information can be used to provide further advertising and promotional offers e.g. related to something at or near where the user is physically located and or to authenticate the actual user versus one who may have stolen or is otherwise using the mobile device in an unauthorized fashion. Such further authentication can involve checking known user traffic and shopping patterns against what is currently happening for a given device .

An actual automatic check in process can involve a subscribed or affirmatively active user entering a merchant location whereupon client computing device associated with user has a low level background program such as check in application running that detects a low level BLE signal from one or more beacons in the store. Client computing device can then wake up and communicate on a more active level with beacon . In some embodiments a device identifier and token can be generated and assigned to client computing device for a particular time location and session with appropriate expiration and other safeguards in place to protect against fraud or other misuse. For example a period of one or two hours might suffice for a typical check in session or event. The process of establishing communications between client computing device and beacon and exchanging metadata and a one time use beacon token to perform a check in is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 938 860 filed on Jul. 10 2013 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 021 045 filed on Sep. 9 2013 the entire contents of both of these applications which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

When user having client computing device enters location user may complete the automatic check in facilitated by BLE beacon as discussed above. In some embodiments the check in may be performed between client computing device and beacon located near door at an entrance to location. As user moves through location with client computing device client computing device may receive content from beacons such as advertisements offers and the like and may also be able to communicate with beacon to effectuate a payment. In some embodiments a merchant or other entity may want to provide a large amount of content such as a video or audio advertisement to user by displaying the content on client computing device . However while beacons may be sufficient for providing images text and other content that has a small file size using BLE communications it may be difficult for beacons to provide larger files over BLE communications. Consistent with some embodiments beacons may be configured to establish a Wi Fi Direct connection with client computing device to quickly deliver a large file such as a video and then close or terminate the Wi Fi Direct connection. In some embodiments other devices in location may also be capable of establishing a Wi Fi Direct connection with client computing device . In such embodiments the connection may be facilitated by beacon .

Moreover as user with client computing device travels through location user may want to connect to network to send and receive e mails surf the web using browser application and other internet based activities. In some embodiments network interface component and or wireless transceiver may be configured for transmitting and receiving data over network using a cellular or mobile data standard such as EDGE 3G HSDPA 4G LTE and the like such transmissions may be metered by the network or cellular provider such that any data that is transmitted may cost user in 10 20 or 100 MB bundles or may count against a data cap associated with an account of user . Moreover as user moves throughout location which may be a covered or walled location a connection to network over a cellular or mobile data signal may become weaker resulting in lower data speeds or the reliance on lower speed standards such as EDGE. Consequently location may include one or more access points that may provide a Wi Fi connection to network for client computing device .

However since a proprietor of location likely pays for the network and maintenance of access points one or more credentials such as a user name Service Set Identifier SSID or password may be required to establish a connection with access point to prevent authorized use. In some embodiments beacons in location may be configured to provide the one or more credentials to client computing device . For example beacons may be configured to provide the one or more credentials to client computing device when client computing device checks in to location although in some embodiments beacon may provide the one or more credentials to client computing device even when client computing device does not check in to location . However in some embodiments. the credentials for access points may be a reward to user for checking in to location and implicitly agreeing to receive advertisements and offers related to location on client computing device .

In some embodiments the received credentials may be displayed on display component of client computing device as a prompt for user to view make note of and enter into a form requesting credentials for connecting to access points . In some embodiments check in application may include additional instructions that when executed receive the credentials as part of the check in process performed with beacon extracts and saves the credentials and retrieves and enters the credentials when prompted by access point . In some embodiments check in application may further actively connect to access point and enter the credentials as part of the check in process.

Beacon may then continuously broadcast a generic identifier. In some embodiments the identifier may be a universally unique identifier UUID and the identifier may be broadcast using a BLE communications protocol. The broadcast identifier may be received and verified by client computing device to initiate communications with beacon . Beacon may then provide information including metadata a specific one time use beacon token and a digital signature to client computing device . In some embodiments client computing device may request the metadata and other information from beacon when communications are initiated with beacon . Check in application may then verify the received information including the digital signature as being issued by the service provider using a public key received from remote server . When the received beacon information is verified as authentic check in application may provide user with the option to check in. When user accepts the check in client computing device may select a token received from remote server encrypt the selected token value and the received beacon token value using a key associated with the selected token and send these encrypted token values to beacon . Beacon then sends the encrypted token values to remote server which decrypts the values and checks in user and user device using the decrypted values. The process of checking in by communicating with a BLE beacon such as beacon is further described in in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 938 860 filed on Jul. 10 2013 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 021 045 filed on Sep. 9 2013 the entire contents of both of these applications which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

In some embodiments beacon may then transmit credentials for access point to client computing device . In some embodiments the transmitted credentials may include a user name SSID password and the like. Client computing device may use these credentials to authenticate with access point and establish a wireless connection with access point and communicate over network through access point . In some embodiments client computing device may send these credentials to access point . In some embodiments check in application may include instructions that when executed cause the credentials to be provided to access point including automatically providing the credentials when prompted by a communication from access point and or displaying the credentials on display component of client computing device for user to take note of for entry. Access point may receive the credentials provided by client computing device and authenticate client computing device . Client computing device may now be in communication with network via a wireless connection with access point . Although illustrates an example when a check in at location is required to receive the one or more credentials in other examples and embodiments beacon may provide the one or more credentials when client computing device initially establishes communications with beacon .

In some embodiments remote server may want to provide content to client computing device . The content that may be provided to device may be offers deals specials information about location and other such content. The content that may be provided to client computing device may also be transaction related content including content related to paying for items user is purchasing from location . However in some embodiments the content that may be provided to client computing device may be one or more files having a large file size such as video audio and the like. For example remote server may want to provide a video advertisement to client computing device . However a large file such as a video advertisement may not be effectively transmitted from beacon to client computing device particularly using a BLE communications protocol. Consequently beacon may be configured to establish a Wi Fi Direct connection with client computing device and send the content to the client computing device over the established Wi Fi Direct connection. In some embodiments once the content has been sent to client computing device beacon may close or terminate the Wi Fi Direct connection with client computing device .

Client computing device may then request metadata and other information from beacon . In response client computing device may receive beacon information such as metadata a beacon token and a digital signature from beacon for checking in to location . Processing component of client computing device may then verify the received beacon information including the digital signature and beacon token using keys stored in memory component of client computing device and received from remote server . Client computing device may then receive a check in acceptance . In some embodiments upon receiving the metadata beacon token and digital signature check in application may prompt user to accept the check in to location by for example displaying an interactive prompt on display component . User may be able to accept the check in by interacting with the prompt using input component navigation control and display component or a combination thereof. When client computing device receives a check in acceptance processing component of client computing device may then encrypt token values and send these encrypted values to beacon . In some embodiments the encrypted values may be sent to beacon by wireless transceiver of client computing device using a BLE communication protocol.

Client computing device may then receive credentials to authenticate to access point . In some embodiments the credentials may be received as part of the metadata received in step . In some embodiments the received credentials may include a user name SSID password and the like. Client computing device may then send these credentials to authenticate with access point . In some embodiments client computing device may automatically send these credentials to access point . In some embodiments check in application may include instructions that when executed cause the credentials to be provided to access point including automatically providing the credentials when prompted by a communication from access point and or displaying the credentials on display component of client computing device for user to take note of for entry.

In some embodiments client computing device may receive content from beacon over a Wi Fi Direct connection established with client computing device . In some embodiments remote server may push content to beacons for providing to client computing device and the content may be one or more files having a large file size such as video audio and the like. Beacon may then establish a Wi Fi Direct connection with client computing device and send the content to the client computing device over the established Wi Fi Direct connection. In some embodiments once the content has been sent to client computing device the Wi Fi Direct connection may be terminated.

Beacon may then send metadata a beacon token and a digital signature in response to a request received from a device that received the broadcast identifier . In some embodiments the beacon token digital signature and metadata may be received from remote server and stored in memory component and or firmware . To complete the check in beacon may then receive encrypted token values from client computing device which are sent to remote server .

Beacon may then send credentials to access point to client computing device . In some embodiments the credentials may be sent as part of the metadata sent in step . In some embodiments the sent credentials may include a user name SSID password and the like. When there is content to provide to user and client computing device beacon may receive the content from remote server over network . Processing component may make a determination as to whether the size of the content is suitable for transmission over a BLE communications protocol . When the size of the content is too large for transmission over a BLE communications protocol beacon may then establish a Wi Fi Direct connection with client computing device and provide the content to client computing device over the Wi Fi Direct connection . In some embodiments beacon may close or terminated the Wi Fi Direct connection once the content has been sent to client computing device . When the size is determined to be suitable for transmission over the BLE communications protocol beacon may send the content to client computing device over the BLE communications protocol .

Remote server may then check user and client computing device into location using one or more values decrypted from encrypted values received from beacon . As discussed above with respect to when user of client computing device accepts a check in client computing device may verify a beacon token provided by beacon and may then encrypt token values and send these encrypted values to beacon which may then send the encrypted values to remote server which processing component of remote server may decrypt and use to check in user and client computing device to location .

Processing component may determine when a check in has expired and check user and client computing device out of location . However as long as user is checked in to location processing component of remote server may periodically determine that there is content to provide to user and client computing device and will provide the content to one or more beacons at location . In some embodiments at least one of the beacons may provide the content to client computing device .
