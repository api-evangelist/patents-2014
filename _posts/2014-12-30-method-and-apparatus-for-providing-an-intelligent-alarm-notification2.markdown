Typically alarm systems utilize various sensors e.g. microphones to adjust and or personalize the notification for a user. Unfortunately the alarm systems while notifying a user may disrupt other users in the nearby vicinity. Since the alarm systems do not acknowledge the sleeping attributes of nearby users to adjust the alarm properties e.g. volume levels alarm timings etc. the notifications are not efficient and are not appropriately directed towards the intended user.

Therefore there is a need for an approach for providing alarm notification to the intended user while minimizing disturbance to the nearby users.

Still other aspects features and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.

Examples of a method apparatus and computer program for providing intelligent alarm notifications are disclosed. In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent however to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.

Although various embodiments are described with respect to mobile phones it is contemplated that the exemplary methods and systems described herein may be used in connection with any other electronic alarm device for example a smart watch wearable devices or any other alarm clock. The alarm functionality could be incorporated in any suitable electronic device such as a personal computer a surveillance device a robot an automatic home assistant an electric toy a hi fi system a gaming console or the like.

As discussed previously alarm notifications may be personalized for a user and may be generated based on information collected from various sensors. For example the sound level of a user s breathing may be captured by a microphone of the user s device. Typically the alarm notification time may then be accordingly adjusted for the user. Unfortunately current alarm notification systems are not effective in situations where more than one person is sleeping in vicinity e.g. friends or spouse sharing a room . In such a situation the person other than the intended user of the alarm is disturbed by the alarm notifications. Therefore the current alarm notification systems are not effective and may be problematic for people sharing a room.

To address this issue a system of enables an alarm clock i.e. as used by an electronic device e.g. a mobile phone a smart watch an alarm clock etc. to estimate the sleep quality of users and accordingly provide alarm notifications. In addition the system enables receiving and processing of sleep information of the users for estimating a suitable moment of time to provide alarm notifications.

In one embodiment the notification platform interfaces with one or more user equipment UE also collectively referred to as UE configured with one or more alarm applications also collectively referred to as alarm module over a communication network . The UE may correspond to a mobile device or a wearable device associated with a user. The alarm applications of the UE acquire sleep characteristic information or the like regarding the sleep quality of the users. By way of example alarm applications at the UE may act as a client for the notification platform and perform one or more functions associated with the functions of the notification platform by interacting with the notification platform over the communication network .

In addition the alarm module may interact with various sensors also collectively referred to as sensors for receiving and analyzing data regarding the commands from user sleep characteristic information of the users position or location of the user etc. By way of example sensors e.g. of a mobile device or embedded within an alarm clock may be used as GPS receivers for interacting with one or more satellites for determining position and location data associated with the user. In addition the sensors may gather position data e.g. a sleep position or direction of the user light data sound data image data weather data temporal data and the like associated with the users and or UEs thereof. Still further the sensors may detect local or transient network and or wireless signals such as those transmitted by nearby devices e.g. another UE in the room . It is further noted in certain implementations that the sensors may operate in connection with each other for enabling data exchange and interaction. This exchange may be facilitated by way of any known or still developing range based or wireless communication protocols.

As will be discussed further the notification platform enables the UE to provide alarm notifications based at least in part on the current sensor data as well as prior collected user data e.g. voice commands alarm time or positions of the users . In one embodiment the notification platform monitors and receives data referred to herein as sleep characteristic information for estimating sleep quality of the users and providing alarm notifications from the UE . The sleep characteristic may include for example breathing sounds of the users voice command of a user for setting up the alarm direction of sound from which the voice command is received directions of sound from which the breathing sounds are received alarm notification time etc. In one embodiment the notification platform stores the gathered data of sleep characteristic information to a profile database for subsequent analysis.

In one embodiment the notification platform processes the sleep characteristic information for generating alarm notification parameters. The alarm notification parameters may include for example an alarm time alarm duration direction of alarm notification pattern of alarm notification level of alarm notification etc. In one embodiment the notification platform processes the voice commands received from a user to generate the alarm time alarm duration or direction of alarm notification. By way of example the user may provide a voice command such as Wake me up between 6 30 and 7 O clock . In this case one or more speech processing techniques are used to determine the alarm time as 6 30 AM and alarm duration during which the notification is to be generated as 30 minutes. Further the direction is detected based on beamforming of the voice command. In addition the direction may be detected based on the breathing sounds of the users.

In one embodiment the notification platform processes the breathing sounds to synchronize them and the remove any undesired sound noise. For example the undesired sound noise includes environmental noise noise from movement or turning of the users in the bed etc. are removed to generate normalized breathing sounds. The synchronization of the breathing sounds from the users enables effective processing of the breathing sounds. For example the breathing sounds from different users received at different times at the notification platform may be synchronized before further processing. Further the notification platform determines a difference between the breathing sound levels of the users. By way of example the difference is calculated by aggregating the sound level information over predefined time duration in form of sound segments and then applying statistical analysis on the levels of these segments. For example the breathing sounds are gathered in segments of 20 milliseconds each and then top 10 of the segments that have the largest difference are used for calculating an average difference.

In one embodiment the notification platform generates alarm notifications based on the calculated difference. For example for an alarm intended for a user of UE if breathing sound level of user at UE is greater from a user at UE by 6 dB then alarm notification is generated at UE . In a scenario where the UE and the UE are nearby both the UEs and may capture breathing sounds from users of both the UEs and . Therefore the notification platform separates the breathing sounds of the UEs and . In an embodiment the notification platform uses the average difference to separate the breathings sounds and thus generate sleeper sounds.

Still further the notification platform estimates breathing parameters of the users by processing the sleeper sounds. For example the breathing parameters include breathing sound levels and rhythm of breathing of the users. As such the notification platform generates alarm notifications based on the breathing rhythm of the users. By way of example if from the breathing rhythm it is determined that the user at UE is generating breathing sounds or will be generating breathing sounds at a time t e.g. at 6 40 AM which is between the alarm duration of 6 30 AM and 7 00 AM while the user at UE is quiet or will be quiet then the alarm notification intended for the UE are provided at that time.

In one embodiment the notification platform estimates sleep parameters of the users for processing the sleeper sounds. For example the sleep parameters include an indication of deep sleep light sleep or snoring of the users. In this case the notification platform generates alarm notifications based on the sleep parameters sleep pattern of the users. By way of example if from the sleep parameters it is determined that the user at UE is sleeping deeply or will be sleeping deeply at a time t e.g. at 6 40 AM which is between the alarm duration of 6 30 AM and 7 00 AM while the user at UE is sleeping lightly or will be sleeping lightly then the alarm notification intended for the UE are provided at that time.

Further the notification platform generates visualization of the sleep parameters. For example the visualization may be in form of graphical charts line chart bar chart and the like. In one embodiment the visualization enables generation of alarm notification.

In one embodiment the alarm notifications are provided based on the direction of the intended user for the alarm. For example the sound beam of the alarm notification is directed to the intended user to cause least disturbance to the other users. As noted previously the direction may be detected based on analysis of the breathing sounds the voice command or other user sounds like turning in the bed or their combination.

While not shown expressly in the service platform and content providers may also interact with the profile database for retrieving location data of users position data of users historic sleep characteristic of the users voice commands of the users etc. It is noted that the notification platform may be configured to operate in connection with any known alarm devices for enabling the initiation of instructions to be executed by the alarm devices by a user of an alarm device or a combination thereof. This may include for example a mobile phone having applications . Under this scenario the mobile phone may communicate with other mobile phones configured to interact with the notification platform . As such the notification platform may determine optimal time or moment type of notification direction of the notification or the like with respect to an alarm duration configured by the user.

By way of example the notification platform may be implemented as a cloud based service hosted platform or the like for exchanging as well as receiving information from the services of service platform providers or alarm applications . Alternatively the notification platform may be directly integrated for processing data generated and or provided by the services providers or applications . Per this integration or interface the notification platform may process sleep characteristic information into useful data for providing intelligent alarm notifications.

By way of example the communication network of system includes one or more networks such as a data network a wireless network a telephony network or any combination thereof. It is contemplated that the data network may be any local area network LAN metropolitan area network MAN wide area network WAN a public data network e.g. the Internet short range wireless network or any other suitable packet switched network such as a commercially owned proprietary packet switched network e.g. a proprietary cable or fiber optic network and the like or any combination thereof. In addition the wireless network may be for example a cellular network and may employ various technologies including enhanced data rates for global evolution EDGE general packet radio service GPRS global system for mobile communications GSM Internet protocol multimedia subsystem IMS universal mobile telecommunications system UMTS etc. as well as any other suitable wireless medium e.g. worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX Long Term Evolution LTE networks code division multiple access CDMA wideband code division multiple access WCDMA wireless fidelity WiFi wireless LAN WLAN Bluetooth Internet Protocol IP data casting satellite mobile ad hoc network MANET and the like or any combination thereof.

The UE is any type of mobile terminal fixed terminal or portable terminal including a mobile handset station unit device multimedia computer multimedia tablet Internet node communicator desktop computer laptop computer notebook computer netbook computer tablet computer personal communication system PCS device personal navigation device personal digital assistants PDAs audio video player digital camera camcorder positioning device television receiver radio broadcast receiver electronic book device game device surveillance device robot personal health device such as a blood pressure monitor or any combination thereof including the accessories and peripherals of these devices or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the UE can support any type of interface to the user such as wearable circuitry etc. .

By way of example the UEs the notification platform the service platform and the content providers communicate with each other and other components of the communication network using well known new or still developing protocols. In this context a protocol includes a set of rules defining how the network nodes within the communication network interact with each other based on information sent over the communication links. The protocols are effective at different layers of operation within each node from generating and receiving physical signals of various types to selecting a link for transferring those signals to the format of information indicated by those signals to identifying which software application executing on a computer system sends or receives the information. The conceptually different layers of protocols for exchanging information over a network are described in the Open Systems Interconnection OSI Reference Model.

Communications between the network nodes are typically effected by exchanging discrete packets of data. Each packet typically comprises 1 header information associated with a particular protocol and 2 payload information that follows the header information and contains information that may be processed independently of that particular protocol. In some protocols the packet includes 3 trailer information following the payload and indicating the end of the payload information. The header includes information such as the source of the packet its destination the length of the payload and other properties used by the protocol. Often the data in the payload for the particular protocol includes a header and payload for a different protocol associated with a different higher layer of the OSI Reference Model. The header for a particular protocol typically indicates a type for the next protocol contained in its payload. The higher layer protocol is said to be encapsulated in the lower layer protocol. The headers included in a packet traversing multiple heterogeneous networks such as the Internet typically include a physical layer 1 header a data link layer 2 header an internetwork layer 3 header and a transport layer 4 header and various application layer 5 layer 6 and layer 7 headers as defined by the OSI Reference Model.

The context module gathers sleep characteristic information captured by sensors . As also previously noted the sensors include but are not limited to microphone GPS etc. of the UE . As previously noted the sleep characteristic information include breathing parameters of each user voice command direction of voice command other sleeping sounds like movements e.g. turning in the bed alarm notification time or a combination thereof. Examples of breathing parameters include but are not limited to sound level and rhythm of breathing. The processing module operates in connection with the context module to interpret the sleep characteristic information associated with the UE . By way of example the processing module works with the speech processing module to recognize voice commands presented by the users. For example a user voice command Wake me up at 6 30 AM is processed by the speech processing module to setup an alarm time of 6 30 AM. Further the processing module operates in connection with the communication module to receive sleep characteristic information from other UE . Further the communication module enables communication over the communication network . In one embodiment the processing module stores the gathered data of sleep characteristic information to a profile database for subsequent analysis. In another embodiment the processing module stores and retrieves location data position data or other historical data related to the users in the profile database .

The execution module determines an instruction an action and or a decision point to be executed by the UE based on the sleep characteristic information. By way of example the execution module estimates rhythm of breathing for the users quality of sleep of the users and accordingly adjusts the alarm notification parameters. In one embodiment the alarm notification parameters include but are not limited to an alarm time direction of alarm notification pattern of alarm notification level of alarm notification or a combination thereof. Per this execution current actions may be executed prioritized or queued for initiation at the UE based on the alarm notification parameters.

The execution module may also operate in connection with the communication module and user interface module to cause the communication or rendering of an instruction respectively. By way of example the execution module may trigger the user interface module which executes one or more application programming interface API executions of the notification platform for presenting the alarm notification i.e. sound light or vibration etc. . In one embodiment the user interface module may generate visualization of one or more sleep characteristic information for one or more users. In one scenario the visualization may be in form of a graph such as but not limited to a line graph a bar graph a histogram etc. By way of example the visualization may enable determination of the status of sleep for one or more users e.g. slower rhythm may be represented as a smaller value on the graph . As another example the execution module may trigger the communication module to communicate an instruction for initiating the execution of alarm notification on other UE based on the information contained in sleep characteristic.

The above presented modules and components of the notification platform can be implemented in hardware firmware software or a combination thereof. As such the notification platform may interact with the operating system or applications of the UE . In another embodiment one or more of the modules may be implemented separately for operation by respective UEs.

In step the notification platform may determine sensor information associated with at least one first user and at least one second user collected while the at least one first user and the at least one second user are asleep. In one scenario the notification platform may receive sleep characteristic information for plurality of users via one or more sensors .

In step the notification platform may process and or facilitate a processing of the sensor information to determine sleep characteristic information for the at least one first user the at least one second user or a combination thereof. In one embodiment the sleep characteristic information includes at least one first breathing rhythm at least one second breathing rhythm at least one first sleeping pattern at least one second sleeping pattern or a combination thereof. In one scenario the notification platform may remove sound information except the breathing sounds of the one or more users via filtering e.g. removing audio signal content outside a frequency range of 200 Hz 3400 Hz segmenting the audio signal to 20 ms segments and using audio classification to recognize segments with breathing sounds and silencing other segments or using audio object separation. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that any other audio processing technique may be used to identify and filter the breathing sounds.

In step the notification platform may determine one or more alarm notification parameters for one or more alarm notifications based at least in part on the sleep characteristic information to direct the one or more alarm notifications to the at least one first user while minimizing a disturbance of the at least one second user. In one embodiment the alarm notification parameters may include alarm time direction of alarm notification pattern of alarm notification level of alarm notification sleep characteristic information for the plurality of users or a combination thereof. In another embodiment the alarm notification may include a sound a vibration a display or a combination thereof. By way of example the alarm notifications are generated when an intended user for the alarm is making less sound than the other users. Further the rhythm of the alarm notification may be based on the breathing level of one or more users.

In step the notification platform may process and or facilitate a processing of the sensor information to determine the at least one first breathing rhythm associated with the at least one first user the at least one second breathing rhythm associated with the at least one second user or a combination thereof. In one example embodiment the notification platform may process the breathing rhythm for one or more users to determine sleep parameters. The sleep parameters may include a status of deep sleep a status of light sleep a status of snoring etc. Then the notification platform may cause an alarm notification based at least in part on the sleep parameters.

In step the notification platform may determine the one or more alarm notification parameters to cause at least in part an adjustment of at least one sound rhythm of the one or more alarm notifications to match the at least one second breathing rhythm for the alarm notifications directed to the at least one first user. In one example embodiment the notification platform may detect that user A is snoring. Then the notification platform may wake user A by timing the alarm so that it occurs when the non snoring user is making sounds and the snoring user is quiet. Alternatively the alarm may be directed towards the direction of the snoring user. In another embodiment if a user is soundly asleep and is quiet the notification platform may utilize user movements in the bed e.g. turning of the users in the bed for detecting the direction of the users and their sleeping patterns.

In step the notification platform may process and or facilitate a processing of the sensor information to determine the at least one first sleeping pattern associated with the at least one first user the at least one second sleeping pattern associated with the at least one second user or a combination thereof during a specified time period. In one example embodiment user A makes adjusts an alarm setting between 6 30 and 7 00. Then the notification platform may find the best moment between 6 30 and 7 00 to wake user A. In one scenario the best moment is when user A is sleeping lightly and user B is sleeping heavily.

In step the notification platform may determine one or more alarm notification parameter to cause at last in part an adjustment of timing of the one or more alarm notification to match the at least one second sleeping pattern for the alarm notifications directed to the at least one first user. In one scenario the notification platform may cause an adjustment in the timing of the alarm of user A so that is occurs when user A is sleeping lightly and user B is sleeping deeply henceforth making sure that user B less likely to be disturbed by the alarm that is meant for user A. In another scenario the best moment to wake a user within the fixed time interval is when the intended user sleeps the lightest and the other nearby users sleep the deepest. However if the intended user is in a deep sleep and the nearby user is in a light sleep the notification platform may decide to wait for a better moment to wake the intended user. The wait may exceed the fixed time period by the user.

In step the notification platform may cause at least in part a synchronization of the sensor information associated with the at least one first user the at least one second user or a combination thereof.

In step the notification platform may cause at least in part a comparison of the synchronized sensor information to determine the one or more alarm notification parameters for the one or more alarm notifications. In one scenario the notification platform may synchronize two microphone signals by finding a time delay that produces maximum correlation between the sleep characteristic information for one or more users in the nearby vicinity. In one example embodiment when UE associated with the second user is significantly e.g. 6 dB louder than UE associated with the first user then the notification platform may determine to sound an alarm to the first user for a brief time.

In step the notification platform may determine a difference between the at least one first sleeping pattern associated with the at least one first user the at least one second sleeping pattern associated with the at least one second user or a combination thereof. In one example embodiment the notification platform may determine the difference in noise level and or body position of one or more users while sleeping to identify the one or more users within a proximate area e.g. a room .

In step the notification platform may cause at least in part the one or more alarm notifications based at least in part on the difference. In one scenario the notification platform may generate one or more alarm notifications for at least one user based at least in part on the different sleep characteristic information of the proximate users. In one example embodiment sleeper sounds may be enhanced by the notification platform by using the determined difference. In one example embodiment the notification platform may cause an alarm notification within the time interval fixed by a user based at least in part on the difference between the sleeping patterns of one or more users. The best moment to wake user 1 is the moment within the fixed time interval and when the difference between the sleeping patterns of user 1 and user 2 is at its greatest i.e. user 1 sleeps the lightest and user 2 the deepest.

In step the notification platform may cause at least in part an implementation of directional sound analysis to detect the direction of the at least one first user the at least one second user or a combination thereof. In one scenario direction microphones or beamforming may be used to focus on sounds from different directions. In one example embodiment the notification platform may use the relative distance and the relative levels of users voices reaching the microphones to determine which parts of the sound belong to which user. In one scenario with the microphone arrays e.g. two or more microphones the sound direction can be used to separate user sounds and the alarm notification may be directed to the same direction from which the user sound was detected.

In step the notification platform may cause at least in part a channeling of the one or more alarm notifications towards the direction of the at least one first user the at least one second user or a combination thereof. In one embodiment any of various known directional sound techniques may be used to channel one or more alarm notifications towards the destined user thereby the disturbance to other users in the vicinity is reduced.

In step the notification platform may cause at least in part a detection of direction for the at least one first user the at least one second user or a combination thereof based at least in part on one or more voice commands. In one scenario the notification platform may receive a voice command from at least one user wherein the voice command includes instructions for setting up an alarm notification e.g. Wake me between 6 30 and 7 O clock . Then the notification platform may process the voice command to cause at least in part a determination of a direction of the user. In one embodiment the direction may be detected by beamforming the voice command. In one embodiment any of various known beamforming techniques may be used to detect the direction.

In step the notification platform may cause at least in part a channeling of the one or more alarm notifications in the directions of the voice command of the at least one first user the at least one second user or a combination thereof.

In step the notification platform may cause at least in part a separation of the sleeping pattern for the at least one first user the at least one second user or a combination thereof. In one scenario the notification platform may separate the sounds made by plurality of users. The separated sounds of one or more users while sleeping may be used for estimating the users sleep patterns for example if user A is the noisiest then he she may have the biggest values on the graph depicting the sleeping patterns.

In step the notification platform may cause at least in part a monitoring of the separated sleeping pattern for the at least one first user the at least one second user or a combination thereof in real time periodically according to schedule on demand or a combination thereof. In one scenario the notification platform may provide an individualized sleep pattern monitoring.

At block the sound m2 captured by Mic2 is synchronized with the sound m1 to generate synchronized sleep characteristic information containing sounds m1 and m2 . As previously discussed the synchronization is performed by finding a time delay that produces maximum correlation between the m1 and m2 . In an embodiment a synchronized clock signals from the UE and US may be used to generate the synchronized sleep characteristic information.

Thereafter at block the sounds m1 and m2 are processed to remove all sounds other than the breathing sounds of the User1 and User2 to generate normalized sleep information. The normalized sleep information for User 1 is depicted as circumflex over m and for User 2 is depicted as circumflex over m in . As previously discussed audio processing techniques may be used to generate the normalized sleep information.

Subsequently at block and the sounds are enhanced by determining a difference in the normalized sleep information. In one embodiment a difference in the levels of sounds circumflex over m and circumflex over m is determined. By way of example signals circumflex over m and circumflex over m are divided into short segments of a predefined time interval e.g. 20 ms . Thereafter it is determined whether each segment contains mostly sounds from User1 or User2. For example a segment contains mostly sounds from User1 if the segment is louder in Mid 1 than in Mic2 . A level difference is then determined from several such segments. Then a predefined percentage of these segments e.g. 10 of the segments that have the largest difference are used to calculate an average difference at block . Thereafter at block the average difference is used to calculate a value p that may represent an estimate of how much louder sounds from User1 arrive at UE than from User2. At block the value p can be used to generate sleeper sounds umlaut over m of User1 and umlaut over m of User2 by using the following equations 

In an embodiment the notification platform uses the average difference to separate the breathings sounds and thus generate sleeper sounds. As previously noted in a scenario where the UE and the UE are nearby both the UEs and may capture breathing sounds from users of both the User1 and User2. Therefore the breathing sounds of the User1 and User2 are separated and enhanced by using the value p and the equations 1 and 2 above.

Per block the breathing parameters of the Users are estimated. As previously discussed the breathing parameters include the breathing rhythm of the Users. The estimation includes a predicted time at which the breathing of the Users takes place. By way of example if from the breathing rhythm it is determined that the User2 is generating breathing sounds or will be generating breathing sounds at a time t e.g. at 6 40 AM which is between the alarm duration of 6 30 AM and 7 00 AM while the User1 is quiet or will be quiet then the alarm notification intended for the User1 are provided at that time. Therefore at block the alarm is played at UE during the breathing rhythm of User2. Hence the User2 less likely to wake up for the alarm intended for User1. Similarly if the alarm is intended for User2 then it is played at UE during breathing rhythm of User1 at block . In one embodiment for better effectiveness the alarm notification sound has a rhythm that matches the breathing rhythm of a user.

In one embodiment the UEs and communicate over the communication network . In another embodiment the UEs and communicate wirelessly over a radio network such as but not limited to Bluetooth WiFi cellular communication etc.

The processes described herein for providing intelligent alarm notifications may be advantageously implemented via software hardware firmware or a combination of software and or firmware and or hardware.

The signals transmitted over network link and other networks through communications interface carry information to and from computer system . Computer system can send and receive information including program code through the networks among others through network link and communications interface . In an example using the Internet a server host transmits program code for a particular application requested by a message sent from computer through Internet ISP equipment local network and communications interface . The received code may be executed by processor as it is received or may be stored in memory or in storage device or any other non volatile storage for later execution or both. In this manner computer system may obtain application program code in the form of signals on a carrier wave.

Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequence of instructions or data or both to processor for execution. For example instructions and data may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer such as host . The remote computer loads the instructions and data into its dynamic memory and sends the instructions and data over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to the computer system receives the instructions and data on a telephone line and uses an infra red transmitter to convert the instructions and data to a signal on an infra red carrier wave serving as the network link . An infrared detector serving as communications interface receives the instructions and data carried in the infrared signal and places information representing the instructions and data onto bus . Bus carries the information to memory from which processor retrieves and executes the instructions using some of the data sent with the instructions. The instructions and data received in memory may optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by the processor .

In one embodiment the chip set or chip includes a communication mechanism such as a bus for passing information among the components of the chip set . A processor has connectivity to the bus to execute instructions and process information stored in for example a memory . The processor may include one or more processing cores with each core configured to perform independently. A multi core processor enables multiprocessing within a single physical package. Examples of a multi core processor include two four eight or greater numbers of processing cores. Alternatively or in addition the processor may include one or more microprocessors configured in tandem via the bus to enable independent execution of instructions pipelining and multithreading. The processor may also be accompanied with one or more specialized components to perform certain processing functions and tasks such as one or more digital signal processors DSP or one or more application specific integrated circuits ASIC . A DSP typically is configured to process real world signals e.g. sound in real time independently of the processor . Similarly an ASIC can be configured to performed specialized functions not easily performed by a more general purpose processor. Other specialized components to aid in performing the inventive functions described herein may include one or more field programmable gate arrays FPGA one or more controllers or one or more other special purpose computer chips.

In one embodiment the chip set or chip includes merely one or more processors and some software and or firmware supporting and or relating to and or for the one or more processors.

The processor and accompanying components have connectivity to the memory via the bus .

Pertinent internal components of the telephone include a Main Control Unit MCU a Digital Signal Processor DSP and a receiver transmitter unit including a microphone gain control unit and a speaker gain control unit. A main display unit provides a display to the user in support of various applications and mobile terminal functions that perform or support the steps of providing alarm notification to the intended user while minimizing disturbance to the nearby users. The display includes display circuitry configured to display at least a portion of a user interface of the mobile terminal e.g. mobile telephone . Additionally the display and display circuitry are configured to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal. An audio function circuitry includes a microphone and microphone amplifier that amplifies the speech signal output from the microphone . The amplified speech signal output from the microphone is fed to a coder decoder CODEC .

A radio section amplifies power and converts frequency in order to communicate with a base station which is included in a mobile communication system via antenna . The power amplifier PA and the transmitter modulation circuitry are operationally responsive to the MCU with an output from the PA coupled to the duplexer or circulator or antenna switch as known in the art. The PA also couples to a battery interface and power control unit .

In use a user of mobile terminal speaks into the microphone and his or her voice along with any detected background noise is converted into an analog voltage. The analog voltage is then converted into a digital signal through the Analog to Digital Converter ADC . The control unit routes the digital signal into the DSP for processing therein such as speech encoding channel encoding encrypting and interleaving. In one embodiment the processed voice signals are encoded by units not separately shown using a cellular transmission protocol such as enhanced data rates for global evolution EDGE general packet radio service GPRS global system for mobile communications GSM Internet protocol multimedia subsystem IMS universal mobile telecommunications system UMTS etc. as well as any other suitable wireless medium e.g. microwave access WiMAX Long Term Evolution LTE networks code division multiple access CDMA wideband code division multiple access WCDMA wireless fidelity WiFi satellite and the like or any combination thereof.

The encoded signals are then routed to an equalizer for compensation of any frequency dependent impairments that occur during transmission though the air such as phase and amplitude distortion. After equalizing the bit stream the modulator combines the signal with a RF signal generated in the RF interface . The modulator generates a sine wave by way of frequency or phase modulation. In order to prepare the signal for transmission an up converter combines the sine wave output from the modulator with another sine wave generated by a synthesizer to achieve the desired frequency of transmission. The signal is then sent through a PA to increase the signal to an appropriate power level. In practical systems the PA acts as a variable gain amplifier whose gain is controlled by the DSP from information received from a network base station. The signal is then filtered within the duplexer and optionally sent to an antenna coupler to match impedances to provide maximum power transfer. Finally the signal is transmitted via antenna to a local base station. An automatic gain control AGC can be supplied to control the gain of the final stages of the receiver. The signals may be forwarded from there to a remote telephone which may be another cellular telephone any other mobile phone or a land line connected to a Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN or other telephony networks.

Voice signals transmitted to the mobile terminal are received via antenna and immediately amplified by a low noise amplifier LNA . A down converter lowers the carrier frequency while the demodulator strips away the RF leaving only a digital bit stream. The signal then goes through the equalizer and is processed by the DSP . A Digital to Analog Converter DAC converts the signal and the resulting output is transmitted to the user through the speaker all under control of a Main Control Unit MCU which can be implemented as a Central Processing Unit CPU .

The MCU receives various signals including input signals from the keyboard . The keyboard and or the MCU in combination with other user input components e.g. the microphone comprise a user interface circuitry for managing user input. The MCU runs a user interface software to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal to provide alarm notification to the intended user while minimizing disturbance to the nearby users. The MCU also delivers a display command and a switch command to the display and to the speech output switching controller respectively. Further the MCU exchanges information with the DSP and can access an optionally incorporated SIM card and a memory . In addition the MCU executes various control functions required of the terminal. The DSP may depending upon the implementation perform any of a variety of conventional digital processing functions on the voice signals. Additionally DSP determines the background noise level of the local environment from the signals detected by microphone and sets the gain of microphone to a level selected to compensate for the natural tendency of the user of the mobile terminal .

The CODEC includes the ADC and DAC . The memory stores various data including call incoming tone data and is capable of storing other data including music data received via e.g. the global Internet. The software module could reside in RAM memory flash memory registers or any other form of writable storage medium known in the art. The memory device may be but not limited to a single memory CD DVD ROM RAM EEPROM optical storage magnetic disk storage flash memory storage or any other non volatile storage medium capable of storing digital data.

An optionally incorporated SIM card carries for instance important information such as the cellular phone number the carrier supplying service subscription details and security information. The SIM card serves primarily to identify the mobile terminal on a radio network. The card also contains a memory for storing a personal telephone number registry text messages and user specific mobile terminal settings.

Further one or more camera sensors may be incorporated onto the mobile station wherein the one or more camera sensors may be placed at one or more locations on the mobile station. Generally the camera sensors may be utilized to capture record and cause to store one or more still and or moving images e.g. videos movies etc. which also may comprise audio recordings.
