No. 12 399 493 entitled Systems and Methods For Content Injection filed Mar. 6 2009 which claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 034 687 entitled Systems and Methods For Content Injection filed on Mar. 7 2008 and which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

The present application generally relates to data communication networks. In particular the present application relates to systems and methods for injecting content into a response coming from a server.

An intermediary appliance may be deployed in a data communication network to accelerate system performance and improve end user experience. An end user s experience in a data communication network is dependent on several factors such as the length of time for the server to respond to a request the length of time for the browser to load the web page and the length of time to render the dependent content on the web page. The intermediary appliance may process transactions between a client and a server. To accelerate performance or improve the end user experience the intermediary appliance may change the content of a transaction. However determining when and how to change the content of a transaction is challenging.

The present solution is directed towards a policy based intermediary that dynamically and flexibly injects content in responses between a client and a server based on one or more policies. The present solution addresses the challenges of injecting content in a client server transaction. The intermediary determines when and what content to inject into a response of a client server transaction based on a request and or response policy. The injected content may include timestamp and or variable tracking of different events in a client server transaction. For example when an intermediary appliance is deployed in a system to accelerate system performance and improve user experience the appliance may inject content based on policy to monitor the acceleration performance of the deployed appliance.

In one aspect the present application features a method for controlling injection of content into a response from a server to a client request. The method includes receiving the server response at an intermediary and determining by a policy engine at the intermediary if the response matches a policy of inserting specified content into the response. The content identifies one or more variables provided by the intermediary. The method also includes modifying the response by the intermediary to insert the specified content comprising a value of the variable identified by the intermediary. The method further includes transmitting the modified response from the intermediary to the client in response of the request.

In some embodiments the method includes determining the time when one or more of the following events occur receiving the first last byte of the client request at the intermediary forwarding the first last byte of the request from the intermediary to a server receiving the first last byte of server response at the intermediary and forwarding the first last byte of the server response from the intermediary to the client. In some other embodiments the method also includes storing the values of these time instants in appropriate variables identified by the content inserted in the response.

In one embodiment the intermediary provides as a value of a variable one or more of an identifier of the intermediary a transaction identified for the request and the response and a system uptime. In another embodiment a policy specifies if one or more of a HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP prebody postbody or header is to be inserted in the server response. In still another embodiment the policy engine determines if a portion of the request the response or a network packet matches an expression of a policy.
