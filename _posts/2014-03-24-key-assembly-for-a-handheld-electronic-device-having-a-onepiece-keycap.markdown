The present disclosure relates generally to input devices and more particularly to key assemblies for handheld electronic devices and more particularly to a key assembly for a handheld electronic device having a one piece keycap.

Keypad and keyboard designs in handheld electronic devices attempt to balance several design constraints which often include the ability to provide illuminated keys a visual separation between keys a tactile separation between keys tactile feedback to device users in response to a key press and providing such features within a relatively thin device profile.

Modern keypad and keyboard designs often utilize dome switches rather than mechanical hard closing switches to provide a thinner device profile. Dome switches provide soft closing switches compared to mechanical hard closing switches which depending on the key assembly in which the switches are used may result in poor tactile feedback to device users in response to a key press often described as a soft or spongy key press . Depending on the keypad or keyboard design which is used the use of dome switches may result in keys which are wobbly and unstable and more prone to damage. In view of these and other deficiencies in keypad and keyboard designs there remains a need for improved key assemblies for handheld electronic devices.

The present disclosure provides a key assembly for a handheld electronic device such as a mobile communications device having a one piece keycap. The keypad has mechanically deforming portions between key portions. The key assembly provides improved key stability provides improved tactile feedback in response to key presses i.e. firm key presses and reduces the likelihood of damaging keys compared with at least some of the known key assemblies. In addition in some embodiments the mechanically deforming portions may be provided using grooves formed in the one piece keypad which when provided on the externally facing side of the keycap provides a visual separation between key portions of the keypad for key identification by device users.

In accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure there is provided a key assembly for use in an electronic device comprising a keycap having a plurality of rigid key portions separated by mechanically deforming portions and a flexible member having opposed first and second sides the first side having a plurality of key stems which are attached to the plurality of key portions the second side having a plurality of actuators for actuating dome switches of the electronic device.

In accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure there is provided an electronic device comprising a controller for controlling the operation of the device a dome sheet comprising a plurality of dome switches connected to the controller for generating an input signal in response to actuation thereof and a key assembly comprising a keycap having a plurality of rigid key portions separated by mechanically deforming portions and a flexible member having opposed first and second sides the first side having a plurality of key stems which are attached to the plurality of key portions the second side having a plurality of actuators for actuating the dome switches the controller being configured for receiving input signals in response to the actuation of the dome switches and for recognizing corresponding inputs in response to the received input signals.

In the shown embodiment of each key portion is separated by respective mechanically deforming portions however in other embodiments more than one key portion may be defined by respective mechanically deforming portions . For example a pair of spaced apart mechanically deforming portions may define a two key pair having a toggle key construction as in the key assembly of .

Referring to a key assembly for use in an electronic device in accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure will be described. As will be described in more detail below the key assembly is similar to the key assembly in many respects with notable differences being that the key assembly provides backlighting of its key portions circuitry for actuating the domes and structural elements for mounting attaching the key assembly to the host electronic device. The key assembly of is used in the construction of a control key panel or keypad of front face of a handheld electronic device such as a smartphone. The key portions represent a phone call key a menu key escape ESC key and an end phone key.

The key assembly comprises a single piece keycap having a plurality of key portions separated by mechanically deforming portions a light guide subassembly a dome sheet comprising domes switches a flexible PCB including light emitting diodes LEDs and a mounting subassembly for mounting the key assembly to the host electronic device for example the handheld electronic device described below. At least some of the key portions have a transparent portion or window for transmitting light therethrough. In the shown embodiment each of the key portions have a transparent portion for transmitting light therethrough to provide backlighting of the key portions . In at least some embodiments the keycap is formed of a rigid polycarbonate. The key portions and mechanically deforming portions of the keycap are formed in a manner similar to the keycap described above. However the keycap includes only 2 mechanically deforming portions .

In some embodiments the keycap is formed of a transparent material such as a light diffusing polycarbonate which is painted with a desired colour or colours and laser etched to remove a portion of the paint and expose the transparent material for transmitting light therethrough. In some embodiments the key portions are painted a first colour which will provide the backlight colour and then painted a second colour which for example matches a colour of the housing of the host electronic device .

When assembled into the host electronic device activation of the LEDs backlights the respective key portions so as to illuminate the laser etched shape in the respective background colour e.g. the first colour .

The light guide subassembly shown in greater detail in comprises an opaque light blocking sheet a stiffening member a pair of transparent members formed of a light diffusing material such as a light diffusing polycarbonate and a pair of flexible members each comprising a pair of key stem protrusions on a first side thereof and a pair of actuators only one actuator in each pair being shown in on a second side of the flexible members opposite the first side. In other embodiments a single flexible member rather than a pair of flexible members could be used. The flexible members are formed of a transparent material for transmitting light therethrough. The transparent material from which the flexible members are formed is also a resilient deformable material which in some embodiments is a transparent silicon rubber Shore A using compression molding.

The stiffening member is formed of an opaque light blocking to provide light blocking as well as stiffening of the key assembly . The stiffening member also includes or has attached thereto support pins extending away from the keycap for supporting the key assembly and attaching the key assembly to the housing not shown of the host electronic device along with the mounting subassembly . The pins are typically heat stake pins but could be alignment pins.

In some embodiments the light blocking sheet is a black or other opaque paper sheet. In some embodiments the stiffening member is formed of a black polycarbonate and the transparent members are a clear light diffusing polycarbonate. In some embodiments the stiffening member and transparent members may be comolded using a two shot injection molding process in which the stiffening member is formed from a black polycarbonate in the first shot and the transparent members are formed from a clear light diffusing polycarbonate in the second shot. In other embodiments the stiffening member could be shaped or otherwise configured to perform all of the light blocking obviating the need for the light blocking sheet . In yet other embodiments the light blocking sheet could be shaped or otherwise configured to perform all of the light blocking so that the stiffening member need not be formed from a light blocking material in which case the stiffening member and transparent members could be one piece.

In the shown embodiments the light blocking material surrounds the entirety of the key stem projections however in other embodiments the light blocking material need only surround the periphery of the light guide assembly in a manner that light is blocked from escaping from the periphery of the keycap .

The flexible PCB includes a pair of LEDs positioned adjacent to the second side of the flexible members and the actuators are located for illuminating adjacent key portions having a transparent portion and the via the corresponding key stem protrusions and transparent members when the LEDs are activated. The transparent members are located directly above the LEDs and in combination with the key stem protrusions and actuators provide the light transmissive materials of the light guide allowing the transmission of light out through the transparent portions of the keycap .

The heat stake pins clips on the secondary stiffener and the second double sided adhesive layer attach the key assembly to the device housing. In other embodiments if the dome sheet and PCB are omitted because a primary dome sheet and PCB of the host electronic device are being used the mounting assembly could be omitted.

Referring to the path of light through the light guide subassembly will now be briefly discussed. The key assembly using the light guide subassembly creates a path of light from the LEDs of the PCB layer through the transparent members and and through the transparent portions of the key portions of the keycap to illuminate the predefined shapes of the transparent portions . The light emitted from the LEDs first passes into the transparent members of the light guide subassembly . The light blocking materials of the light guide subassembly direct the light outwardly towards the transparent flexible members and block the light from escaping from the periphery of the keycap . Next the light passes from the transparent flexible members through the transparent portions in the adjacent key portions of the key cap .

In the key assembly the light guide subassembly provides the dual functions of a light guide and a stiffener. However in other embodiments a stiffening member without light guiding could be used instead of the light guide subassembly . In such embodiments the stiffening member is similar to the stiffening member described above in connection with and surrounds at least a portion of each of the plurality of key stem protrusions which are attached to the plurality of key portions . Typically the stiffening member surrounds the entirety of each of the plurality of key stem protrusions . The stiffening member may be formed of metal or rigid plastic i.e. a hard plastic or inflexible plastic in some embodiments. The stiffening member could take the shape of the light blocking sheet or the stiffening member of the light guide subassembly shown in . The stiffening member includes or has attached thereto the support pins . The stiffening member supports the key assembly and prevents it from bowing out of the housing of the host electronic device or deforming the key assembly while allowing local flexing and deformation of the flexible member and key portions of the key cap . The stiffening member could surround the entirety of each of the plurality of key stem protrusions and could be disposed between the keycap and the flexible members comolded with the flexible members or disposed below the flexible members provided it is proper adhered to the bottom of the flexible members at the location of the support pins .
