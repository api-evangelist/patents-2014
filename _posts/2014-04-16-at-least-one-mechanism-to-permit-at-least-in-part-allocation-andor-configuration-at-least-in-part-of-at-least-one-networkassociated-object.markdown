This disclosure relates to at least one mechanism to permit at least in part allocation and or configuration at least in part of at least one network associated object e.g. by at least one process.

In one conventional distributed computing system a switch fabric permits communication among the system s resources. Depending upon the particular application to which the system is intended to be put the nature and or characteristics of the fabric and resources may vary. For example for high performance parallel computing applications the fabric and resources may be configured so as to provide low latency high bandwidth and scalable communication between or among the system s resources and processes. Additionally in prior conventional techniques the system s intended usage model has dictated the specific types of programming models and interfaces to be employed. For example systems that implement scientific coding related usage models typically have employed the Message Passing Interface MPI programming model e.g. of the type described in MPI A Message Passing Interface Standard Version 3.0 Message Passing Interface Forum Sep. 21 2012 and related conforming interfaces. Also for example conventional systems that operate on irregular data structures have employed the Partitioned Global Address Space PGAS programming languages model and related conforming interfaces. Additionally for example conventional systems that process relatively large amounts of data have employed the Map Reduce programming model of Google Inc. of Mountain View Calif. United States of America and related conforming interfaces. The respective underlying philosophies semantics and or other specifics of these programming models and interfaces tend to be very different from each other.

Typically in order to be able to provide sufficiently high performance the interfaces are designed in such a way as to be very closely attuned to the specific fabric hardware that is employed in the system. This tends to increase the degree to which such interfaces differ from each other depending upon the particular programming model and fabric hardware employed in the system.

As can be readily appreciated as a result of the foregoing in such conventional systems hardware or software developed in accordance with a particular programming model and or for use with a specific interface and or fabric hardware often cannot be easily redeployed for use or interoperate with other hardware or software developed in accordance with different programming models and or for use with other interfaces and or fabric hardware. Additionally in such conventional systems it is often difficult to combine and or utilize library functions interfaces etc. associated with a specific programming model and or fabric hardware with other library functions interfaces etc. associated with other programming models and or fabric hardware. Furthermore none of these conventional systems permit cohesive robust interoperability of multiple different programming models libraries interfaces and or fabric hardware in a single system. Additionally none of these conventional systems facilitate relatively easy extensibility of the programming models and or interfaces employed e.g. so as to be enhanced to support new other and or additional features capabilities functions etc. while also permitting implementation of hardware specific optimizations.

N and or feature subsets A . . . N A . . . N that may be associated with and or embody at least in part these communication interfaces A . . . N.

One or more mechanisms A and or discovery control API may receive at least in part respective information A . . . N and may present and or provide the information A . . . N to the one or more processes in a manner that indicates at least in part one or more portions e.g. information A of the information A . . .

This may indicate to the one or more processes the one or more corresponding devices e.g. A feature sets e.g. A subsets A and or objects e.g. A and or A that may offer the greatest likelihood of supporting the best and or most compatible communication performance with respect to the one or more processes at least in terms of the one or more queries and or parameters .

For example one or more processes may utilize one or more mechanisms A . . . N and or interfaces in the above manner to query resources e.g. comprising at least in part nodes B . . . N and or devices A . . . N to determine at least in part which of these resources 1 may be available for allocation and or configuration e.g. as and or in association with at least in part one or more objects A and or A for use in communications with the one or more processes and or 2 may have communication interface capabilities that may best support and or may best fit match those specified in the one or more queries and or parameters . In response at least in part to the one or more queries and or parameters these respective resources may provide respective information A . . . N that may indicate at least in part their respective resource availability and or communication interface capabilities. One or more mechanisms A and or B . . . N may modify at least in part the ordering e.g. sequence ordering and or formatting of information A . . . N and or may impart and or imbue to such information A . . . N one or more emphasis and or importance characteristics and or parameters not shown such that as presented and or provided to one or more processes the manner in which the information A . . . N may be provided to one or more application may indicate at least in part to one or more processes the relative priority of such information A . . . N to undergo analysis by one or more processes . This relative priority may be based at least in part upon the respective relative likelihoods of the respective information A . . . N to be able to satisfy e.g. in terms of fitting and or matching the one or more queries and or parameters . For example as presented and or provided to the one or more processes the respective information A . . . N may be in and or conform to at least in part one or more rank orderings that may correspond at least in part to this relative priority. For example if one or more portions e.g. information A of the information A . . . N are most likely to satisfy the one or more queries and or parameters they may be presented in the one or more rank orderings first followed by one or more other portions e.g. information N of the information A . . . N that are next most likely to satisfy the one or more queries and or parameters and so forth for remaining portions of the information A . . . N. As presented and or provided at least in part to one or more processes respective subsets of the respective information A . . . N may correspond at least in part to respective A . . . N that may be instantiated based at least in part upon the feature sets and or subsets thereof of the devices A . . . N.

One or more mechanisms A . . . N may expose at least in part one or more authorization keys see that may be used at least in part to determine at least in part whether the information A . . . N that is to be provided at least in part to the one or more processes is to be limited at least in part. For example one or more mechanisms A API sets and or API and or may permit one or more processes to furnish to devices A . . . N one or more authorization keys that may indicate at least in part whether and or to what extent one or more processes may be permitted to receive information responsive to one or more queries and or parameters . Depending upon the authorization or lack thereof indicated by one or more keys the information A . . . N and or responses A . . . N provided by devices A . . . N may be limited e.g. so as to provide only that information that may be permitted given such authorization at least in part.

Based at least in part upon this information A . . . N and or the one or more rank orderings thereof one or more processes may select at least in part one or more devices e.g. A features sets e.g. A subsets A and or objects e.g. A and or A that may offer the greatest likelihood of satisfying the one or more queries and or parameters . One or more processes then may allocate and or configure e.g. to in and or as at least in part one or more objects A and or A to be instantiated at least in part in accordance with e.g. one or more subsets of one or more parameter sets that may correspond to and or be comprised in at least in part one or more query parameters . One or more processes may request at least in part this allocation and or configuration by for example providing to one or more devices A e.g. via one or more mechanisms A and or B one or more data structures see .

For example as shown in one or more parameter sets and or although not shown alternatively or additionally one or more subsets may be or comprise one or more elements and or fields A . . . N that may correspond at least in part to attributes of and or that are to be instantiated as in and or as part of one or more objects A and or A. For example attributes may comprise at least in part one or more and in this embodiment a plurality of attributes A . . . N. These attributes may be specified at least in part one or more data structures that may be generated and or issued at least in part from the one or more processes e.g. via one or more mechanisms A and or one or more of API and or to and or to be received e.g. by and or via one or more mechanisms B and or one or more appropriate corresponding API thereof depending upon for example particular functionality of the API at least in part by one or more devices A. One or more data structures may comprise at least in part one or more elements and or fields A . . . N. One or more e.g. A of these fields A . . . N may indicate at least in part which of the other elements e.g. B . . . N of the one or more data structures may contain one or more respective values that may have been validly enumerated by one or more processes e.g. prior to and or contemporaneously with being generated and or issued by one or more processes .

For example elements A . . . N may be have and or comprise at least in part respective values A . . . N. These values A . . . N may correspond to and or be reflected in at least in part attributes A . . . N. These attributes A . . . N and or values A . . . N may correspond to and or be reflected in the respective values A . . . N of respective fields A . . . N. However if one or more parameter sets and or subsets were to comprise fewer elements and or values than were previously described such that for example one or more elements N and or values N were not present therein then in this example one or more attributes N also may not be present in attributes . Therefore as generated and or issued at least in part by one or more processes one or more data structures may not comprise one or more fields N and or values N that may correspond at least in part to one or more attributes N elements N and or values N.

In the above exemplary situation one or more of the other fields and or values comprised in one or more data structures e.g. one or more fields A and or values A may indicate at least in part that the validly enumerated fields and or values that may be comprised in one or more data structures does not include one or more fields N and or values N. For example in this embodiment there may be multiple possible versions of the protocol or protocols that may be employed to use one or more mechanisms A . . . N. Each of these versions may be associated with and or utilize a respective predetermined version of the one or more data structures . Each of these respective versions of the one or more data structures may comprise be associated with and or utilize respective predetermined types classifications and or numbers of fields and or values. When generating and or issuing one or more data structures one or more processes may indicate at least in part in one or more elements A and or values A 1 the one or more versions of the protocol or protocols that the one or more data structures may be associated with and or 2 one or more mask and or other values that may indicate at least in part which of the possible elements and or values have been validly enumerated e.g. in accordance with the particular protocol version or versions . A receiver of the one or more data structures may examine the one or more fields elements A and or values A to determine at least in part which of the possible fields elements of one or more data structures may have been validly enumerated by one or more processes in accordance with the particular one or more versions of the protocol or protocols that one or more processes may have generated and or issued the one or more data structures . Advantageously this may make it relatively easy to extend modify and or change the version fields elements and or values that may be employed in one or more data structures and or the protocol that may employed to use the one or more mechanisms A . . . N while maintaining at least in part forward and or backward compatibility with other e.g. newer and or older versions of such protocols and or one or more data structures . Further advantageously this dynamic configuration capability may avoid inclusion and or use of unnecessary fields elements of the one or more data structures may result in reduced stack and or other memory space consumption e.g. to store data structure elements and or associated data and also may reduce associated processing cycles and power consumption.

Various other elements B . . . N and or values B . . . N in one or more data structures their corresponding attributes in attributes and or their corresponding elements in one or more parameters sets subsets and or parameters may correspond and or be related to at least in part to various aspects to be instantiated in and or by one or more objects A and or A. For example one or more parameters may be related to at least in part one or more requested addressing formats see that one or more processes are to employ at least in part in communicating with one or more objects A and or A e.g. via one or more mechanisms A and or B . Accordingly for example one or more addressing format elements e.g. B and or values e.g. B may indicate at least in part these one or more requested addressing formats . In this example one or more devices A may be capable of translating at least in part these one or more requested addressing formats to one or more other addressing formats see that may be utilized at least in part by one or more devices A and or one or more components portions feature sets etc. thereof for one or more e.g. communication related operations that may be implementable at least in part by one or more devices A and or objects A A. Additionally or alternatively one or more addressing formats may be utilized at least in part by one or more other e.g. downstream objects e.g. M N nodes e.g. M N and or devices e.g. N in network and or one or more components feature sets and or portions thereof.

In this embodiment an address may be comprise and or indicate at least in part one or more logical virtual and or physical locations. In this embodiment an addressing format may be comprise embody and or indicate at least in part 1 manner and or form in which address information is conveyed and or symbolized and or 2 meaning of characters values and or symbols and or one or more portions thereof that may be used to convey and or symbolize addressing information such as for example without limitation whether one or more characters values and or symbols convey network address information logical address information physical address information etc. Accordingly in this embodiment the translation and or resolution of a network internetwork logical virtual address and or of the address format of such an address may but is not required to comprise at least in part converting the address into one or more corresponding physical medium access control addresses or vice versa.

Additionally or alternatively in this embodiment one or more parameters may be related to at least in part one or more requested data format see that one or more processes are to employ at least in part in communicating with one or more objects A and or A e.g. via one or more mechanisms A and or B . Accordingly for example one or more data format elements e.g. C and or values e.g. C may indicate at least in part these one or more requested data formats . For example in this embodiment one or more data formats may comprise at least in part one or more event data formats for e.g. reporting to one or more processes event data that may be comprised in and or obtained at least in part from one or more event e.g. communication operation completion queues that may be associated at least in part with and or comprised at least in part in one or more objects A A and or one or more devices A. Such event data may comprise at least in part successfully completed e.g. communication related operation data e.g. A B . . . N and or unsuccessfully e.g. communication related operation data e.g. A . . . N . For example one or more processes may select the particular contents of one or more elements C and or values C so as to select one or more particular corresponding event data formats . These one or more event data formats may be selectable at least in part by one or more processes such that the manner in which the successfully completed and or unsuccessfully completed operation data are interspersed with each other in being and or as reported to the one or more processes may be selectable at least in part. For example the particular contents of the one or more elements C and or values C may select such one or more data formats such that regardless of their particular interspersing and or ordering relative to each other in the one or more event queues any and all of the unsuccessfully completed operation data in the one or more queues is to be reported to the one or more processes before any of the successfully completed operation data in the one or more queues is to be reported to the one or more processes . Additionally or alternatively the one or more data formats may indicate at least in part other types and or conditions of one or more formats of data e.g. big endian little endian etc. that may be communicated between the one or more processes and one or more objects A A and or one or more devices A .
