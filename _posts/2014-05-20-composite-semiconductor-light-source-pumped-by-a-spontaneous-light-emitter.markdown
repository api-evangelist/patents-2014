This invention was made with Government support under Air Force Research Laboratory AFRL of the Department of Defense DOD Phase II SBIR Contract No. FA8650 08 C 1418. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.

Disclosed embodiments relate to composite semiconductor light sources that include a first light source that optically pumps a second light source which provides an emission for the composite light source.

Semiconductor vertical cavity devices operate by emitting light in the normal direction to an epitaxial growth surface. In such a device a partial or complete cavity is formed on the same semiconductor substrate that includes the active light emitter. Semiconductor vertical cavity devices include vertical cavity surface emitting laser VCSEL diodes and resonant cavity light emitting diodes RCLEDs .

A VCSEL is a laser resonator that includes two mirrors which are typically distributed Bragg reflector DBR mirrors which have layers with interfaces oriented substantially parallel to the die or wafer surface with an active region including of one or more bulk layers quantum wells quantum wires or quantum dots for the laser light generation in between. The planar DBR mirrors comprise layers with alternating high and low refractive indices. Each layer has a thickness of a quarter of the laser wavelength in the material yielding intensity reflectivities that may be above 99 .

A laser device typically has a threshold current that is determined by the cavity and gain design. For current levels above this threshold current the device operates as a laser. For currents below this threshold current the device operates in a spontaneous regime. It is also possible a device that emits spontaneous emission is unable to operate as a laser. When the current is above a lasing threshold the laser generates heat in its light emission process since its quasi Fermi energy separation for electrons and holes exceeds its emitted photon energy.

A laser also generates some heat when electrons and holes absorb some of the laser light but remain respectively in the conduction band or valence band known as free carrier absorption. In this case some of the laser light is absorbed and this internal absorption also reduces the laser light output. A laser also generates some heat if electrical currents are used to transport electrons and holes to an active region with an external electrical bias. These voltage losses that come from the electron and hole charge transport and the optical absorption that comes from the electron and hole free carrier absorption decrease the laser s efficiency and increase its self heating. The optical absorption increases the laser s threshold which further decreases its efficiency.

Because the light is most efficiently extracted from a vertical cavity diode s surface in the same region in which electrical current is injected into its active area a particular problem in semiconductor vertical cavity emitting diodes is the efficient lateral confinement of their electrical current to the same region that confines the optical mode. Known approaches to this problem include the standard intra cavity oxide approach that suffers from mechanical strain increases in the vertical cavity diode s drive voltage and blocking heat flow inside the vertical cavity diode.

Some semiconductor light sources are composite light sources which include an electrically pumped laser within a resonant cavity between a pair of mirrors that optically pumps another laser. The beam from the pump laser is a well directed i.e. low angular spread beam because of its cavity and emitter properties from the design of the laser. For this type of composite light source the composite light source includes a cavity and gain design for the pump laser that brings the pump laser to threshold at a current drive that is less than the threshold of the laser to be pumped. This type of pump laser in a composite light source typically delivers a pump beam of light that has low angular spread due to stimulated emission.

Disclosed embodiments include composite semiconductor light sources including a first vertical light source acting as a pump for a second light source where the first light source has an active emitting region having a thickness sufficient typically at least 0.1 m to about 5 m so that the emission is predominantly a spontaneous emission defined herein to be at least 50.1 of the light emitted with the remainder of the emitted light being light emitted by stimulated emission with the spontaneous emission typically being at least 99 . Depending on the needed pump power thinner active emitting regions such as quantum wells or multiple quantum wells which may be planar quantum wire like or quantum dot like may also be used. The first light source can comprise a light emitting diode LED .

As used herein and commonly understood by those having ordinary skill in the art stimulated emission is an emission process by which an atomic electron or an excited molecular state or a conduction band electron of a semiconductor interacts with an electromagnetic wave of a certain frequency to drop to a lower energy level transferring its energy to the field of the electromagnetic wave. The new photon created in this manner has the same phase frequency polarization and direction of travel as the photons of the incident wave. This is in contrast to spontaneous emission that Applicants use as the pump light source which occurs without regard to the ambient electromagnetic field and comprises an emission process by which a material is in an excited state with energy Eand decays spontaneously into an energy state having energy E so that a photon having a certain frequency can be released the energy of the emitted photon usually not exceeding the difference between the two energy states E E .

For a conventional laser such as a vertical cavity surface emitting laser VCSEL operating above its lasing threshold can have only a few percent e.g. 5 of its emission due to spontaneous emission with the remainder of the emission being stimulated emission. When below threshold a VCSEL is typically very inefficient. This is because the spontaneous emission has a much wider radiation pattern such that only a small fraction can escape the laser cavity. Because of this spontaneous emission is recognized to typically be an inefficient means to optically pump. However it is recognized herein when placed in composite cavities or similar close coupling spontaneous emission with a wide radiation pattern trapped in the semiconductor can also be used to efficiently optically pump another active light source. In this case the inability for light to escape the semiconductor is recognized to be beneficial for efficiency. For this to occur the lasing threshold of the pump source e.g. LED for lasing should be greater than that of the active source it is pumping. Under these conditions the pump source e.g. LED avoids stimulated emission and produces the wide radiation pattern that can be trapped in the cavity.

The differences between conventional optically pumping with a laser and disclosed optically pumping with a spontaneous emitter e.g. with an LED is that the spontaneous emitter has different emitter and cavity requirements for lasing. Since thick bulk emitting layers of the LED can provide more power in spontaneous emission they have advantages in pumping at higher power. In this case if inverted in its electron hole population the spontaneous emitter e.g. LED would likely produce a great deal of stimulated emission that may not couple to the gain of the laser to be pumped. For example lasing in the optical pump could produce stimulated modes that couple less than 1 or so of their light into the laser to be pumped. In this case the spontaneous emitter e.g. LED can be maintained to have a wide angular range such as 30 to 45 degrees up to close to 90 degrees and produces a wide angle emission to pump the laser into laser operation. Accordingly disclosed composite light sources produce a different optical pump pattern over a wide angular range that results directly from the active emitter.

Some embodiments include light sources including a depleted heterojunction current blocking region DHCBR within an outer current blocking region of at least one of the upper mirror lower mirror and the active region. In this embodiment the conducting channel is within the inner mode confinement region that physically contacts and is framed by the DHCBR wherein the DHCBR functions to force current flow into the conducting channel during operation of the light source. The DHCBR includes a depleted heterojunction which inherently includes a depletion region as well the depleted heterojunction to provide the current blocking. As known in the art and used herein a heterojunction is the interface between two layers or regions of dissimilar crystalline semiconductors where the respective semiconducting materials have unequal band gaps.

A DHCBR is defined herein to comprise first and second materials where the respective materials are different materials e.g. GaAs and AlGaAs interfaced with one another to form a heterojunction. The doping in the first and second materials may be the same or the doping in the second material may be less than the doping in the first material. The first material being interfaced to the second material in the heterojunction depletes the mobile charge carriers of the second material to form a highly resistive region in the second material so that the second material has no more than about 1 10cmmobile charge carriers due to dopants. As such the second material in the heterojunction is referred to herein as a depletable second material since it depletes in mobile charge concentration such as from a concentration of about 10cmwhen in isolation to a concentration of about 10cmto about 10cmwhen in the heterojunction interfaced to the first material.

A range of heterojunction materials and doping concentrations can be used to produce disclosed DHCBRs. An important DHCBR aspect is that the DHCBR possesses an electrical resistance that is sufficiently high to prevent leakage currents around an active region. It is useful to characterize the electrical resistance in terms of a contact resistance normalized to a blocking area in units of ohms cm. In some embodiments it is desirable that the DHCBR also have low capacitance to enable high speed modulation of the light source.

By disclosed composite light source embodiments using predominantly spontaneous emission to optically drive the second light source the spontaneous emitting pump light source can operate with a drive voltage less than the corresponding photon energy. Accordingly disclosed semiconductor light sources can remove heat generating electrons and holes from the active region of the second light source that originate from the presence of dopants by eliminating or reducing the concentration of its dopants in its active region. Moreover by using a predominantly spontaneous emission for pumping off normal axis optical pump energy due to the spontaneous emission can be readily absorbed in the second light source to provide the emission for the compound light source. In addition the pump energy obtained from spontaneous emission can be generated with very high overall efficiency. In principle the efficiency of the spontaneous emitter e.g. LED can exceed unity and enable it to operate as both an optical pump and a heat pump. The heat pump created by the active emission can absorb heat from current flow through electrical contacting and heat given off by the optically pumped laser.

Disclosed embodiments in this Disclosure are described with reference to the attached figures wherein like reference numerals are used throughout the figures to designate similar or equivalent elements. The figures are not drawn to scale and they are provided merely to illustrate the disclosed embodiments. Several aspects are described below with reference to example applications for illustration. It should be understood that numerous specific details relationships and methods are set forth to provide a full understanding of the disclosed embodiments.

One having ordinary skill in the relevant art however will readily recognize that the subject matter disclosed herein can be practiced without one or more of the specific details or with other methods. In other instances well known structures or operations are not shown in detail to avoid obscuring structures or operations that are not well known. This Disclosure is not limited by the illustrated ordering of acts or events as some acts may occur in different orders and or concurrently with other acts or events. Furthermore not all illustrated acts or events are required to implement a methodology in accordance with this Disclosure.

Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of this Disclosure are approximations the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value however inherently contains certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements. Moreover all ranges disclosed herein are to be understood to encompass any and all sub ranges subsumed therein. For example a range of less than 10 can include any and all sub ranges between and including the minimum value of zero and the maximum value of 10 that is any and all sub ranges having a minimum value of equal to or greater than zero and a maximum value of equal to or less than 10 e.g. 1 to 5.

Disclosed embodiments include semiconductor light sources including diode lasers and arrays of such lasers based on selective non blanket buried acceptor p type diffusions or selective donor n type diffusions that simultaneously provide both the electrical injection path into the laser and optical mode confinement. Associated with the diffusion are particular material properties that result from how a donor or acceptor impurity atomic concentration profile exists across heterointerfaces. A dopant impurity diffusion creates unique material profiles of the impurity distribution through the heterojunctions due to the diffusion process and these produce structures in the final device which can be determined using different characterization techniques such as secondary ion mass spectroscopy SIMS or others.

An optical mode confining phase shift may also be included in an otherwise planar resonant cavity. In one embodiment each acceptor or donor diffusion provides a conducting channel that defines the mode confinement area of a small resonant cavity light emitting diode or a VCSEL. Disclosed arrangements can reduce the operating current or voltage and control the optical mode for improved sensors data communication high power light sources for optical pumping or materials processing as well as other applications.

In some light source embodiments a DHCBR is formed within an outer current blocking region of at least one of an upper mirror a lower mirror and the first active region that frames a conducting channel of the light source. The DHCBR forces current flow into the inner mode confinement region during operation of disclosed light sources. A selective dopant diffusion can also be performed in the inner mode confinement region to form a conducting channel laterally inside the DHCBR to further reduce electrical resistance into inner mode confinement region. The dopant diffusion can be either an acceptor diffusion or a donor diffusion.

In other embodiments an acceptor diffusion can be performed through an active layer into a region vertically adjoining the active layer that contains differing material compositions containing donor dopants. These differing material compositions can be such that the acceptor diffusion incorporates to a greater degree into one of the material compositions to change its electrical conductivity by producing an acceptor concentration that exceeds the donor concentration while incorporation into the differing material composition to a lesser degree to maintain an acceptor concentration that is less than the donor concentration. In this manner a conductivity change can be obtained between the differing material compositions vertically adjoining the active layer and thus impede the current flow. Thus the acceptor diffusion can form a buried acceptor diffusion in which the acceptor passes through one material composition to incorporate mainly in a second and differing material composition. It is also possible that the acceptor concentration exceeds the donor concentration in a material with lower incorporation but forms a DHCBR after diffusion due to heterojunctions and the respective material compositions.

When an acceptor diffusion is performed through an active layer it can also modify the active layer composition causing intermixing between the active layer and surrounding materials. This intermixing with surrounding materials can further provide mode and electrical confinement by changing the active material composition and thus its emission energy and refractive index.

In some embodiments mesas are included. Mesas are known in the art as being structures that provide a step height which can improve current confinement mode confinement e.g. to provide single mode operation and also reduce the threshold current for lasing. Fabrication methods are also disclosed herein that include using material beneath mesas initially not doped with dopant impurities to create a conductivity type different than the mesa and the semiconductor material above the mesa. Diffusion of dopant impurities from the mesa into the semiconductor material below the mesa can convert the semiconductor material immediately below to the same type as the mesa while regions outside and below the mesa can remain substantially free of dopants. In this way a DHCBR can be formed outside the mesa to provide a high resistance region while the mesa region itself and the layer immediately below the mesa can provide low electrical resistance. Thus electrical current may be forced to flow mainly through the mesa in the inner mode confinement region so that efficient electrical injection is made into the same region that confines the optical mode.

Upper DBR may also be replaced with other mirror schemes such as combined with dielectric or metal layers. It may also include an optical coupling element. Although light source is shown in as being top emitting disclosed light sources can be also be side emitting or bottom emitting. In the embodiment described relative to the substrate can be an n GaAs or an n GaAs substrate. Other substrates and epitaxial materials can be used such as InP GaN sapphire GaP InAs Si Ge which are all commonly used to form semiconductor light emitters.

Although a substrate is shown in and other FIGs. herein in some process flows the substrate is removed at or near the end of processing so that the light source only includes the epitaxial layers that form the light source with no supporting substrate. In this process flow the light source is generally transferred to another substrate. For example a substrate less light source may be transferred to a silicon substrate for integration with silicon based electronics so that the epitaxial film of the laser can be grown on its matching substrate e.g. GaAs since it may not be able to be grown on a silicon substrate due to epitaxial incompatibility. It may also be inserted into a display.

Light source includes an inner mode confinement region and an outer current blocking region . As described below a disclosed selective diffusion forms the conducting channel shown as part of the inner mode confinement region .

The upper DBR includes an electrode such as an acceptor p doped p contact. Light source also includes a lower mirror shown as a lower DBR such as donor n doped mirror having an electrode such as an n electrode having an N contact. The DBRs each generally include 10 to 30 periods such as 18 25 periods for the lower DBR and 15 to 20 periods for the upper DBR . In one specific embodiment upper DBR can comprise p AlGaAs GaAs stacks while the lower DBR can comprise n AlGaAs GaAs stacks. The light source is formed in at least two epitaxial growth steps. Lower DBR can also be replaced with output coupling layers or a mirror approaching zero reflectivity.

The upper DBR and lower DBR can each comprise fully semiconductor DBRs or can comprise partial DBRs with added metal or dielectric layers that provide added reflectivity. In the case of added metal or dielectric layers the layer thicknesses can be chosen to obtain the needed interference in the emitted light such that the desired reflectivity is achieved. These thicknesses depend on the specific material parameters as known in the art.

An active region is positioned between the respective DBR s and . The active region can comprise at least one bulk layer quantum well QW layer quantum wire layer or quantum dot layer. An example QW layer comprises InGaAs formed between adjoining GaAs layers. More than one layer may make up active region such as multiple QW layers bulk layers quantum dot layers quantum wire layers and combinations thereof.

One of the layer stack heterojunctions i.e. junctions between two materials with different band gaps e.g. AlGaAs GaAs stacks in the upper DBR is shown as heterojunction . Heterojunction includes DHCBR within its outer current blocking region and a conducting channel in its inner mode confinement region . DHCBR provides both optical mode and electrical confinement.

Conducting channel can include acceptor doping in the range from about 5 10cmto about 1 10cm while the DHCBR lateral to the conducting channel has a doping level on its more lightly doped side that may be the same or be significantly below that of conducting channel to provide lateral electrical confinement such as a maximum acceptor doping of 1 10cm maximum doping of 5 10cm maximum doping of 1 10cm such as a maximum doping of 1 10cm including an even lower doping level when intentionally not doped during fabrication. For example intentional doping may be eliminated from the more lightly doped side of the DHCBR so that it contains only background impurity concentrations due to the epitaxial growth often less than 10cm such as doping in the range from 1 10cmto 1 10cm. The depletable material side of DHCBR has a voltage dependent depletion region thickness in the vertical direction shown as t in .

The current blocking ability of the DHCBR can be described by the contact resistance it creates given in the units of ohm cm cm . This contact resistance is given approximately by the equation below in terms of the depletion layer thickness hole concentration in the depleted layer p and hole mobility as

Lithography applied to inner mode confinement region after an initial epitaxial growth step can be used to define selective doping in conducting channel and thus very small size devices since the device area is generally only limited by the resolution of the lithography tool e.g. 50 nm . This lithography step and semiconductor surface processing through etching can be used to remove some of the semiconductor material in outer current blocking regions in a given layer or layers to enable the conducting channel to be in the form of the mesa structure shown. The mesa structure can occur anywhere in the upper DBR .

To achieve the minimum threshold for a given device size however it can be an advantage if the conducting channel is placed within two optical wavelengths free space wavelength divided by the refractive index nin the crystal distance to the active region and for the mesa to be between 5 to 300 in height with the optical wavelength relative to that in the semiconductor material. An acceptor diffusion from the remaining semiconductor material in the conducting channel not removed using lithography can then be performed including in the epitaxial growth apparatus. If the diffusion is performed outside the growth chamber after diffusion the semiconductor surface can then be cleaned and the wafer placed back in the semiconductor epitaxial growth apparatus to form subsequent epi layers to complete the upper DBR .

The diffusion from the remaining crystal region can be performed in the epitaxial growth apparatus. Thus conducting channel can provide a mesa including an acceptor diffusion level or donor diffusion level sufficient to provide the conducting channel in inner mode confinement region through an otherwise current blocking layer heterojunction .

The band diagrams shown in depict the DHCBR shown in under zero bias and a forward bias respectively. The width of the depletion region t in DHCBR can be seen to increase with a forward bias voltage applied forward bias applied between electrodes and which serves to further block the current flow across the DHCBR and thus direct the current to the conducting channel . If two heterojunctions are used the depletion width may remain fixed with applied bias.

Although the conducting channel is provided by an acceptor diffusion as described relative to as noted above the conducting channel can also be formed n doped by using an donor impurity n type diffusion instead of acceptor impurity diffusion. In this arrangement the depleted heterojunction is also embedded in n type material to form the outer current blocking region .

Considering the contact resistance for the p conducting channel with thickness t it can given approximately by 

The conducting channel however can also suffer increased contact resistance due to heterojunction effects. In addition the hole concentration in the conducting channel formed by acceptor diffusion will in general depend on the incorporation of acceptor impurity in the conducting channel materials. Therefore the particular material compositions making up the DHCBR can be selected based on an objective to achieve both a current blocking characteristic in outer current blocking region and a conductivity level in the conducting channel for low voltage drive in inner mode confinement region . Higher hole concentrations can decrease the voltage drop over the conducting channel to a few mV.

A significant feature of disclosed DHCBR is that its improved temperature properties in the VCSEL can be used to make improved optical data links. The optical link generally includes a housing for electronic circuitry that receives data in electrical form and conditions the electrical signals to drive DHCBR comprising VCSELs that produce the optical data signals. This housing increases in temperature during operation of the optical link which increases the temperature of operation of the VCSELs. The speed with which optical data can be transmitted by the link through an optical medium such as an optical fiber waveguide or free space and received by photodiodes and additional electronic circuitry that converts the optical data back to electrical data may largely be set by the temperature performance and speed of the VCSELs.

Transceivers place the transmitting and receiving electronics and photonics components in a common housing and allow both sending and receiving data by electronic circuitry VCSELs and photodiodes contained in a single housing. If the optical medium is optical fiber and the fiber permanently fastened to the housing contains the interface electronics VCSELs and photodiodes the complete system can form an active optical cable. By using DHCBR comprising VCSELs the optical links including active optical cable can be made to operate over a wider temperature range and or with higher speed and with greater reliability. These advantages are important for applications for example in which large numbers of transceivers are used in close proximity and cause heating consumer products based on active optical cables that may have small housings to conserve space and optical data links used in space and satellite communications.

The thickness t of the DHCBR can range from 10 nm to more than 0.2 m. By increasing the thickness the capacitance of disclosed light sources such as a VCSEL can be reduced. At the same time the capacitance is reduced the electrical and thermal resistances can remain low because of the all epitaxial structure. An example of a low electrical resistance of a conducting channel in a DHCBR is with the data described below relative to .

The DHCBR can also be used to make very small area light sources such as VCSELs and RCLEDs. This is because the conducting channel is formed lithographically which also forms the lateral cavity of the device. Therefore the conducting channel can be as small as 100 nm in diameter or smaller based on the available lithographic tool. This provides the opportunity to make very small sized VCSELs and RCLEDs for dense integration into various systems increasing the system s capabilities. The very small sized VCSELs can be used to transmit high speed optical data signals. The small sizes are particularly useful for integrating onto Si photonic chips since the small sized VCSELs can couple their outputs to Si photonic waveguides. The small sized VCSELs are also important for improved sensors since reducing their cavity size can improve their single mode properties.

Small RCLEDs or VCSELs are also useful for driving up converters to produce red green and blue light sources. By making the RLCEDs and VCSELs with very small device sizes a large number of devices can be simultaneously produced on as common substrate using low cost semiconductor processing. Disclosed devices can also be combined with epitaxial lift off techniques which could make the RCLEDs and VCSELs very low cost. The RCLEDs are especially attractive for this since they can use low Al content in their n type layers and mirrors to ease the lift off. This could make them useful for ultrathin displays and or curved displays. VCSELs may also be used this way.

The display can be comprised of a thin screen that can contain the up converters and RCLEDs or VCSELs and the electrical interconnection of the pixels. Matrix addressing can be used to interconnect the pixels based on luminescence decay times of the up converters. In addition the display may include the electronic circuitry to receive a video display signal and convert it to electrical driver signals for the RCLEDs or VCSELs to excite the up converters and display an image.

In such a display the up converters that emit the red green or blue light could be placed in their own small cavities. These can be metal coated with Ag for example for high output coupling and optical isolation. Other metals can also be used an may have advantages in cost or thin film material properties. These up converter cavities may be 25 m to 300 m or more in lateral size depending on the display and pixel resolution. The minimum size can be smaller than 25 m and set mainly by the up converter particle size and RCLED or VCSEL size. The RCLEDs or VCSELs infrared light emission can be efficiently coupled to the up converter cavity through a small aperture so that once trapped the infrared light emission is efficiently absorbed by the up converters. By placing the up converters in their own cavities the pixels can be isolated. This can lead to very high quality red green and blue pixels in a display that may only be a few hundred microns thick and or with a curved screen.

If the conducting channel and DHCBR are defined in lateral size to be elliptical or at least non cylindrical the polarization of the light source such as a VCSEL may also be controlled. This polarization control can arise due to preferred reflectivity by the Bragg reflectors favoring lower loss for one polarization vs. another. However other mechanisms may also control the polarization. Controlling the polarization can be used to make improved sensors. This is because the cavity size can be made so small using the DHCBR and conducting channel that only one spatial lasing mode may be allowed with within the gain bandwidth of the active material. This gain bandwidth may include spectral shifts due to temperature changes as well as electronic bandfilling. Elliptical or non cylindrical lateral confinement can then be used to control polarization.

The ability to make the cavity very small and control the polarization can lead to VCSEL sources capable of making improved sensors especially those using Doppler sensing as well as atomic clocks. These sensors include housings that comprise the electronic circuitry and photonic components to direct light beams from the small lasers and detect difference in the reflections of the light beams to perform sensing. Or the VCSELs are used to excite rare earth atoms by properly modulating the VCSEL output to create resonant optical drive conditions with the atoms. In these sensors the electronic circuitry and sensor performance depends on the single mode qualities of the VCSEL. Therefore these sensors can be improved by highly single mode polarization controlled VCSELs that can be fabricated by reducing the size and controlling the shape of the conducting channel .

The structure of light source is analogous to light source shown in except the blocking structure provided by the selective diffusion comprises a selective acceptor diffusion into acceptor impurity diffusion region and layer which is applied to the outer current blocking region in active region and one or more periods above or below active region . Since lower DBR is shown as an n type DBR such as an n type AlAs GaAs DBR acceptor impurity diffusion being into an n type DBR forms a reverse biased upon normal operation of light source p n junction blocking layer comprising an n type layer e.g. AlAs layer as layer that stays n type after receiving the acceptor impurity diffusion while the other layer being originally n type layer e.g. GaAs layer gets converted to p type after receiving the acceptor impurity diffusion.

In light source the acceptor diffusion can be performed outside the inner mode confinement region and diffused through the active region n type layer and into one or more layers to convert to p type. Diffusion conditions can be fixed to obtain substantially different solubilities for the acceptor diffusion in layers and to form an n p junction between these layers. For example diffusion of Be an acceptor at temperatures less than about 615 C. can cause the Be to pass through layer which in one embodiment may be AlAs with little substitutional incorporation into the semiconductor crystal lattice leaving layer n type. The Be substitutional incorporation into layer which in one embodiment may be GaAs can at the same time be sufficient to convert this layer to p type conductivity forming a reverse bias p n blocking junction to electrical current during normal operation of light source .

Layer for example can be formed from n type AlAs or n type InGaP doped with donor impurities at a concentration of 1 10cmor higher for which the transfer of Be or other acceptor impurity to substitutional lattice sites can be made to be minimal. Layer can be formed from GaAs which prior to the acceptor diffusion can be n type but can be converted to p type due to the Be diffusion and ease of the Be transferring to substitutional positions on the GaAs lattice. Other acceptor impurities such as those found in the column II of the periodic table of elements can also be used such as Mg Zn or Cd. If intermixing is achieved in the active region in the outer current blocking regions additional mode confinement can be obtained through refractive index change due to the layer intermixing and electrical confinement can be obtained due to an energy gap change resulting from the layer intermixing. The acceptor diffusion may be obtained from an implanted source a source diffused from layers epitaxially grown on the surface and removed prior to a second epitaxial regrowth or from the surface of the upper DBR .

It is also possible that the acceptor diffusion into the lower n type mirror form one or more DHCBRs. This can occur when the diffusion and doping conditions are such that a very light hole concentration is formed in one layer that is depletable by the second layer. This can happen for example for n type GaAs AlAs layers for which the n type AlAs is doped lightly to n type and diffusion conditions drive most of the acceptor out of the AlAs except a small remaining fraction converting the AlAs to p type. N type GaAs AlGaAs layers may also achieve this.

The mode confinement arrangements shown in can be combined to provide even greater electrical confinement to the inner mode confinement region . In the case the inner mode confinement region includes a mesa the electrical current can then be confined to the phase shifting mesa even for a device with electrode placement that covers a much larger area than the phase shifting mode confining mesa. In this way the thickness of the additional layers outside the inner mode confinement region to provide strong current blocking also can also function as optical alignment markers for additional lithography steps that follow the mesa and DBR formation.

During operation of the composite light source vertical spontaneous emission generated by the light source in active region at photon energy h is absorbed in the waveguide and or active region of lateral light source to provide optical pumping to generate laser light at photon energy h which emits for the side of the active region . The condition for absorption of vertical cavity light is that h 

As described above spontaneous emission from a light source such as a LED and stimulated emission from a semiconductor laser or super luminescent diode are far different processes. Spontaneous emission can have a much broader radiation pattern while stimulated emission tends to be directional. Light source is designed to produce mainly spontaneous emission and thus generate significant off normal emission due to spontaneous emission having an angular range of at least 30 . As described above this is accomplished by designing the thickness of the active region of the optical pump to be sufficiently large such that its lasing threshold is greater than the laser it is pumping. In this case the spontaneous emission stays below threshold while using its spontaneous emission to optical pump the laser to above its threshold.

Furthermore it is desirable to make the spontaneous emission pump to have a threshold for lasing well above the maximum operating level desired for the optically pumped laser. In this way the spontaneous pump laser maintains its wide angular range for emission over the full range of operating conditions desired for the laser. By designing the light source to be a spontaneous optical pump having a bulk thickness of at least 1 m for the active region a GaAs spontaneous pump it can in principle maintain the active region e.g. a GaAs emitting region in an absorbing condition negative optical gain it can be electrically driven to 4000 A cm. In this way its threshold for lasing can be made well above that needed for optical pumping a laser into above threshold operation. Its operating range of current density can be further increased with increase the GaAs thickness. In some cases a 5 m or more thick active region providing a spontaneous emitting region may be desired with could provide as much as 20 kA cmpump level to the lateral light source operating as an optically pumped laser. In addition active region may be made thinner if the maximum drive level desired for laser operation is also for lower current density. The important aspect is that active region remain in the spontaneous regime while pumping laser . The layers around active region i.e. the GaAs described above can be made for efficient injection and doped p and n.

This off normal emission can be effectively trapped between two mirrors especially for angles beyond the critical angles of mirrors and . Mirror along with absorption by light source combined with the drive level of light source are designed to maintain light source in a spontaneous regime so that pump emission by light source covers a large angular range of 30 degrees or more. By using primarily spontaneous emission as opposed to stimulated emission from light source the absorption of pump energy generated by light source can be more effectively absorbed by the active region of lateral light source . In this manner the efficiency of the composite light source chip can be increased. Note that the angular emission shown in also influences this lasing spot size. The angular emission may also be wider than that shown in which will again affect the lasing spot size. This angular range will also be set by the optical pump s active region thickness and absorption properties and the degree of reabsorption of photons emitted by the optical pump maintained in the absorbing region. It is noted that maintaining the optical pump at a condition of optical transparency zero gain is also possible but can make the efficiency sensitive to fluctuations in the operating conditions.

Spontaneous regime is maintained by choosing the light source to have a thickness of its active region so that active region remains optically absorbing or near transparency to produce little stimulated emission under the maximum desired pump level. For an example light source shown in having a substrate comprising GaAs with a GaAs bulk thickness of 1 m enables a pump level up to approximately 4000 A cm. This GaAs thickness can be increased to as much as about 5 m to 10 m enabling approximately 20 000 A cmof electrical drive to the GaAs light source while remaining absorbing or close to transparency. Therefore high pump levels can be achieved with the high efficiency pump operating in the spontaneous regime.

Active region may include one or more light emitting regions emitting at h or within some spectral range of this energy and absorbing layers to absorb light at h . By using the spontaneous emission from active region to pump the active region dopants can be removed the active region and from the cladding layers surrounding active region . In this way heat generation that would otherwise come from electrons and holes and their free carrier absorption that accompany these dopants or from free carrier absorption by electrons and holes that are otherwise injected and provide electrical transport from an external applied bias can be reduced or eliminated and optical loss due to absorption by free carriers can be reduced. By designing the layers of active region to both provide a low threshold for lasing and sufficiently high potential barriers in the absorbing layers of active region to keep electron and hole concentrations low in these absorbing regions very low internal optical loss can be achieved in composite light source for its own emission of light at photon energy h .

In addition the light source may be doped heavily and be operated to produce a low drive voltage to the composite light source of FIGS. A B by making the active region a bulk emitter of high efficiency and driving the active region with a sufficiently low drive voltage the vertical cavity light source can be made to absorb heat in its active region . The amount of heat that can be absorbed depends on the thickness of active region internal quantum efficiency injection efficiency into the active region and the bias voltage. In practice the active region may be a few thousand angstroms in thickness to several microns. Active region is therefore able to operate under some conditions as a heat pump and absorb some its own heat from surrounding electrical contacting material and composite light source .

As noted above lateral cavity optical loss can thus be reduced by having a low concentration typically 

Under the condition that the drive voltage of each separate spontaneous emitter region is less than its own photon energy h q the light source acting as a spontaneous emitter can be made to absorb heat generated by the laser. In this manner the spontaneous emitter not only serves to increase the efficiency of the laser by removing heat generating free carriers that would be associated with doping the laser but can further increase the overall efficiency by converting some heat back into pump emission of the spontaneous emitter. By removing the free carriers and reducing the optical absorption the lateral cavity laser can also be made to have a longer cavity without suffering significant optical absorption of its laser light and thus its power output increased.

To increase the absorption efficiency of the active region of the lateral light source in absorbing the vertical emission provided by active region a second mirror not shown can be placed between the spontaneous emitting active region and the active region to increase resonant absorption through field interference. In combination or separately the active region of the lateral light source may be made to capture lateral spontaneous emission from active region through coupled lateral waveguides. By maintaining the voltage bias of active region to cause absorption of its own spontaneous emission photon recycling can be generated to further increase the pump efficiency of the lateral cavity laser by the spontaneous emitting active region .

In addition as noted above the upper DBR or other mirror shown in may not be needed. If sufficient absorption is obtained in the active region so that nearly all photons emitted from the spontaneous emitting active region are absorbed in a single pass the mirror can be eliminated. Because the majority of the emission from light in general mirror will reflect only a range of angles from the active region so some light is always expected to pass. By properly choosing photon energies h and h such that h h by a few amounts of the thermal energy or more nearly all light from the light source can be absorbed in active region if the absorbing layers are thicker than about 1.5 m. For example the thermal energy is 26 meV at room temperature. In practice a thickness of 3 m to 5 m or more e.g. 3 m to 10 m may be used for the active region .

The low voltage contacting to the light source shown in can be facilitated using the DHCBR within the p side mirror of light source . In this way high thermal conductivity and low drive voltage can be simultaneously obtained.

An important advantage of the composite light source for the case that active region forms a laser is that because the internal optical absorption of this laser can be reduced its cavity length can be increased and greater power extracted from its aperture. Increasing this power from the aperture enables improved solid state and fiber laser sources.

For example the composite light source of FIGS. A B can be connected to an active or passive fiber of a given diameter so that the semiconductor laser aperture coupled to the fiber is limited in its own aperture. Because the semiconductor laser can operate with increased cavity length because of its decreased internal optical absorption it can also operate with an increased power. This enables an increase in power from the fiber coupled to the semiconductor laser. If the fiber is an active fiber to form a fiber amplifier or fiber laser the fiber amplifier or laser will also be capable of greater power.

If the fiber is connected to a fiber network comprised of additional semiconductor lasers with the fiber outputs optically coupled to a single fiber the same power laser can thus operate with fewer semiconductor lasers and fiber couplings. This can reduce the size of the fiber laser system for a given power level. Because semiconductor lasers such as composite light source shown in can be made to operate with lower internal electrical and optical losses they can also be made to operate more efficiently. Therefore the improved fiber laser can also be made to consume less power for a given power output and operate more efficiently.

Active region may also be designed to operate in a superluminescent regime to maintain a broad spectrum. In this case the optical pumping by active region can help to distribute the pump excitation among more than one emitting region placed in active region . In particular by forming multiple quantum dot active layers that themselves exhibit little optical absorption for each other and emit at slight different center wavelengths a very broad emission spectrum source can be constructed. This source can be useful to make an improved instrument for optical coherence tomography OCT .

The top electrode is shown as an n electrode that includes a center aperture to allow light emission therethrough as shown. The bottom electrode is shown as a p electrode . Above the lower DBR mirror is a disclosed DHCBR having a p type conducting channel . In this embodiment the second vertical cavity light source having the active region shown as can be a VCSEL which partially shares a cavity with the light source having active region . By optically pumping the light source e.g. a VCSEL with spontaneous emissions from the active region as described above dopant impurities can be removed or reduced below 1 10cmfrom the active region to reduce free carrier absorption that causes both heating and optical loss.

In this embodiment the middle mirror shown forms a reflector for the composite light source with active region while effectively allowing light from the active region of light source to pass through the middle mirror and be absorbed in active region . This middle mirror can be designed to have two reflectivity bands by choosing its layer thicknesses based on multiples of the two center wavelengths. One of the reflectivity bands can be used to reflect the light from active region with sufficient value to lase as a VCSEL and a second reflectivity band that is used to cause resonant absorption of the spontaneous emission from active region . Likewise the upper DBR can also be made to have two reflectivity bands one of which forms a VCSEL with active region and one of which causes resonant absorption of the spontaneous emission from active region . The lower DBR or other mirror can then be designed to have a reflectivity band only for the spontaneous emission from active region .

As with the case of the light source shown in in the case of the composite light source embodiment of the deleterious effects of free carrier absorption causing heat generation and light absorption can be reduced by optical pumping and heating due to electrical transport eliminated for the second VCSEL. In addition multiple active regions can be added to the VCSEL that are resonant with its vertical lasing mode so that its optical gain is increased and its cavity requirements for lasing reduced. Optical pumping can also produce more uniform lasing for large VCSEL areas. In addition mesas can be added to the VCSEL with active region and cavity extensions used to form phase coupling feedback including Talbot feedback. Each of these arrangements can enable more desirable cavity conditions to be reached for high efficiency in lasing from their active region.

As described above disclosed light sources include a robust form of a low cost laser or other light source by incorporating lithographic control of the optical mode that also produces polarization control and forces current through an optimum electrical injection path. It forces the current through the injection path while also enabling easy heat flow through the device to reduce thermal resistance. Disclosed embodiments also enable low voltage operation and improved optical performance from semiconductor laser diodes.

Disclosed light sources have applications in visible light emitters high speed optical interconnects optical sensing displays and optical pumping. Sensor uses for disclosed embodiments include position sensors gas sensors bio sensors and time keeping atomic clocks .

Disclosed embodiments are further illustrated by the following specific Examples which should not be construed as limiting the scope or content of this Disclosure in any way.

The DHCBR included an 650 thick AlGaAs undoped layer clad on its lower side by p type AlGaAs and on its upper side by p type GaAs. Some undoped graded interfaces are also included to reduce the electrical resistance of the p diffused conducting channel . The apertures include the DHCBR blocking region outside the p channel diffused regions. The current vs. voltage characteristics show that the p diffused heterostructure can reduce the voltage for a given operating current density by using current funneling into the conducting channel. The test laser included disclosed depleted heterojunctions for current confinement with a selective p diffusion Be acceptors to form the conducting channel .

The measured current density vs. voltage shown in for the test structure includes a three quantum well InGaAs emitting region centered at 980 nm wavelength the p diffused region that shows that the voltage is 1.53 V for a current density of 10A cmfor the 15 m diameter device. When series resistance to the device is accounted for the actual device voltage is 1.49 V for a current density of 10A cmin the 15 m diameter mesa test device. The blocking voltage was 3.5 V for the outer current blocking region that includes the DHCBR for these devices.

A significant aspect of these measurements is that very small devices are expected to produce the smallest drive voltages for high excitation levels of the active region. This is because additional electrical resistances above and below the conducting channel can be minimized by making small devices of 5 m or less. A feature of this scaling can be seen in the current density vs. voltage curves of . As the device size reduces the voltage required to create this current density decreases. This is because spreading resistance to the device active region more favorably decreases the voltage and because the drive current for a given current density decreases. These small sizes can minimize spreading resistances so that drive voltage is mainly due to the active region e.g. p n quantum well emitter and conducting channel . The results shown in evidence that the p diffused conducting channel can provide a very low drive voltage to the active region of three quantum wells. For a VCSEL the very low drive voltage can produce high efficiency as well as enable high speed modulation for optical data generation. Since the low drive voltage can be achieved in very small devices it can also be used to make high efficiency displays using RCLEDs or VCSELs.

The laser cavity was 100 m wide and 0.5 cm long which is also the cross sectional area of the GaAs spontaneous emitter. In the spontaneous emission that is composed of GaAs emission is shown at roughly 875 nm to 900 nm and emission of the InGaAs quantum well that was optically pumped by the light source being a GaAs spontaneous QW emitter at around 1 000 nm. shows the emission at higher electrical driver levels to the active region comprising a GaAs spontaneous active region causing lasing in the InGaAs quantum well in region at 990 nm.
