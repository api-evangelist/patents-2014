title: Pre-call recording
abstract: A recording of a subject is covertly generated prior to, and subsequent to an operator answering the call. The recording of the subject prior to the operator answering the call involves recording the subject and/or enabling the operator to listen in on the subject prior to indicating to the subject that the operator is communicating on the line. The subject is connected and a ring tone is generated and played back to the subject while audio received from the subject on the connection is recorded or otherwise monitored. Playback of the ringtone leads the subject to believe a connection has not yet been established. The operator may listen to the audio transmitted by the subject without the subject knowing the operator is covertly ascertaining situational information. The operator may provide a selection or answer the call to begin bi-direction communication with the subject which causes the ring tone to cease playing and lead the subject to believe the connection has just been established.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 845 371 filed Jul. 12 2013 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present disclosure generally relates to the field of undercover operations and more specifically to covertly gathering situational information from a subject.

Police officers informants and other agents operators oftentimes deal with nefarious subjects during the course of their duties. In many cases the subjects are encountered during the course of undercover investigations that require the operator to use phones to call or otherwise communicate with the various subjects. Oftentimes the subjects may ascertain information about the operator or a plan that may endanger the operator. For example the subjects may discover that an informant is working with the police or discover the identity of an undercover officer. In such cases the subjects attempt to hide that knowledge from the operator. Accordingly an operator may subsequently encounter a subject unbeknownst that an assumed identity or plan is compromised.

In other situations an operator such as a police negotiator may interact with subjects during a hostage crisis or standoff. Oftentimes important information the operator requires to make decisions in the field relative to the situation can only be provided by the subject. In many cases subjects are less than truthful and provide the operator with false or misleading information. Decisions based on the misleading information may diminish the safety of an entry team hostages and the subject himself.

While these difficulties are discussed with respect to an operator private individuals e.g. a business owner and other entities may face similar difficulties.

The Figures FIG. and the following description relate to preferred embodiments by way of illustration only. It should be noted that from the following discussion alternative embodiments of the structures and methods disclosed herein will be readily recognized as viable alternatives that may be employed without departing from the principles of the embodiments.

Reference will now be made in detail to several embodiments examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying figures. It is noted that wherever practicable similar or like reference numbers may be used in the figures and may indicate similar or like functionality. The figures depict embodiments for purposes of illustration only.

Traditionally a standard phone call is conducted by the subject entering the phone number of the operator or selecting an address book entry then pressing a physical or on screen button to initiate the connection. Audio recordings may be collected if and only the operator answers the call to establish the connection.

Embodiments of systems and methods described herein relate to covertly generating an audio recording of a subject prior to and subsequent to an operator answering the call. The recording referred to herein as a pre call recording involves recording the subject and or enabling the operator to listen in on the subject prior to indicating to the subject that the operator is communicating on the line. For example a ring tone may continue to play for the subject even after the operator has answered the call. The operator may then listen to the subject without the subject knowing the operator is covertly ascertaining situational information.

Additionally a virtual number may be used to automatically establish a connection with the subject and begin a recording prior to enabling the operator to establish the connection with the subject. Thus for example a pre call recording may begin as soon as possible without the operator involvement. A ring tone may be played on the virtual number for the subject while the pre call recording is generated. The operator receives a connection request from the virtual number which may be spoofed with subject device information and may answer the call to establish a connection by way of the virtual number. Even after the operator answers the call the ring tone may continue to play for the subject while the operator listens to audio from the subject s phone on the virtual number. The operator may be muted throughout the process to prevent the subject from becoming aware that the operator is listening to the call and or the call is being recorded.

The operator may subsequently indicate when he wishes to communicate with the subject e.g. through a key in on the operator device . In turn the ring tone played for the subject device e is stopped and the operator device is unmuted thus leading the subject to believe that the operator has just established the connection by answering the call. However the subject has unknowingly been providing the operator or agency with pre call audio since the call was initiated.

In some embodiments the operator may choose from additional options to covertly generate an audio recording or listen in on the subject. For example the operator may choose to play a busy tone for the subject rather than establish the call. In another example the operator may choose to play a disconnect tone for the subject rather than close the connection through ending the call. Thus for example the operator may covertly listen and or record audio from the subject until the subject ends the call. In another example the operator may choose to let the call go to voicemail and covertly listen to the subject prior to a voicemail recording.

In some embodiments an agency may desire to monitor audio on the operator s line that is placing the call through the virtual number. As the operator connects to the virtual to place a call to the subject audio may be recorded on the virtual number from the operator. Thus for example an informant may be covertly recorded when placing calls to the subject and the subject covertly recorded when placing calls to the informant. In such cases the informant may unaware that subjects contacting the informant through the virtual number are being recorded while the informant s device is ringing. Accordingly bi directional communication between the informant and the subject may be established and the ringing on the line stopped when the informant answers the connection request. In such cases the pre call recording during the ringing may be ended without explicit input from the informant.

Depending on the embodiment one or more monitoring devices are further configured to access and listen in on a pre call recording and any subsequent conversation or covert audio gathering activity. For example the monitoring devices may access a web interface API or execute a standalone application for viewing operator device and virtual number details and collected information. In some embodiments the monitoring devices may connect to the virtual number in a similar fashion as the operator device however audio from the monitoring device is muted to prevent the subject and operator from realizing the call is being monitored. Thus the monitor may be provided with call audio while the operator s cover is maintained or without alerting an informant.

Agency service represents a collection of compute devices e.g. servers and related storage mediums that are configured for performing various activities such as providing pre call recording services exchanging data over the network and storing data in support of one or more agencies not shown and operated operator devices . For example the agency service may include one or more modules providing ascribed functionality to an agency via an application programming interface API or web interface collectively the interface as described in more detail with reference to . The agency service may also include infrastructure for providing audio communicability e.g. internally and or over the network within the monitoring interface using the public switched telephone network PSTN and voice over internet protocol VoIP .

The operator device is oftentimes a mobile telephonic device capable of collecting data and transmitting data e.g. wirelessly over the network . Some examples of an operator device include a mobile phone tablet or notebook computer. Example embodiments of the operator device as a mobile phone include feature phones smart phones or standard mobile phones. Accordingly a given mobile phone or other device operated as an operator device may not necessarily include or support all of the functionality ascribed herein to the operator device or pre call recording system due to inherent differences in device capabilities. In some embodiments other telephonic devices such as land line phones are used with the pre call recording system.

In one embodiment the operator device executes a pre call recording module for automating a pre call recording without utilizing the agency service . In turn the operator device may collect and transmit pre call recording data to entities on the network . An example embodiment of a pre call recording module is described in more detail with reference to .

In addition to the operator devices a number of monitoring devices not shown may connect to entities on the network to obtain or present data associated with one or more of the operator devices and pre call recordings. Depending on the embodiment a monitoring device is a network capable device that can be operated within an agency or externally in the field. As referred to herein a monitoring device is a mobile or stationary device capable of connectivity e.g. wireless or wired to a network such as an agency network the internet PSTN and or cellular network. Some examples of a monitoring device include a mobile phone land line phone tablet and notebook or desktop computer.

Example embodiments of the monitoring device as a mobile phone can include feature phones smart phones or standard mobile phones. In one example embodiment the monitoring device executes a monitoring module for interfacing with entities on the network to manage operator devices pre call recordings and view collected data.

Also shown is a subject devices associated with a subject the operator desires to communicate with using a desired identity. Embodiments of the various subject devices include any network capable device that may send or receive information associated with a transmitting number on the network however in some instances the subject device may use a virtual number itself or other means to do so . Accordingly as referred to herein a subject device is a mobile or stationary device capable of connectivity e.g. wireless or wired to the network for sending or receiving information over the internet PSTN and or cellular network. Some examples of a subject device include a mobile phone land line phone tablet and notebook or desktop computer.

Alternatively the subject device may dial a transmitting number of the operator device directly in which case the pre call recording module on the operator device handles the connection to the subject device and recording of the subject.

Based on the device information and configuration of the virtual number the agency service identifies devices requesting to communicate with a virtual number as either the operator device associated with the virtual number or a subject device and in some cases a monitoring device . For example the agency service may maintain a mapping table storing transmitting numbers and authentication information for a given operator device and attached virtual numbers for identifying the operator device based on the connection information . Additionally the agency service may maintain a mapping table identifying whether a pre call recording should be created for subject devices attempting to connect to the operator device .

When the operator device requests to communicate with the virtual number the agency service identifies the transmitting number of the device as that of the operator device using the mapping table. After identifying the operator device the agency service enables the operator device to specify a given subject the operator would like to communicate with and in turn enables the operator device to communicate with the subject device through e.g. establishing a connection with or transmitting data from the virtual number. For example the operator device specifies device information such as a transmitting number for the subject device . The agency service receives the device information for the subject device and transmits instructions that cause the subject device to receive a call from virtual number . If the subject device answers the parties are connected.

In turn for pre call recording when the subject device requests to communicate with the virtual number the agency service determines that the transmitting number of the device is not that of the operator device using the mapping table. Thus the agency service may identify the device as either a monitoring device e.g. due to a transmitting number of the monitoring device being stored in a mapping table or subject device e.g. due to a transmitting number of the subject device not being stored in a mapping table . If the agency service identifies the subject device as attempting to communicate with the operator device through the virtual number the agency service establishes the connection with the subject device on the virtual number and audio transmitted from the subject device begins being recorded. As the same time the agency service causes playback of a ring tone on the virtual number to the subject device such that the subject believes a connection has not yet been established i.e. the subject is still waiting for the operator to answer the call . The operator device may then be dialed from the virtual number and accept the connection request from the virtual number to listen to the subject as the recording is being made and the ring tone is still being played for the subject. In such cases the operator device may be muted to prevent the subject from recognizing that a connection has already been established and the subject is being recorded and or monitored. If the operator desires to communicate with the subject the operator makes a selection on the operator device that causes the ring tone to stop playing for the subject and unmutes the operator device . In some embodiments number information for the virtual number may be spoofed to match that of the subject device such that the operator can identify the subject by the transmitting number of the subject device.

In instances where the subject device dials the operator device directly the operator device automatically or manually e.g. using or within the pre call recording module opens the connection with the subject device and audio transmitted from the subject device may be recorded at the operator device itself. The pre call recording module plays a ring tone on the line such that the subject believes the connection is still being established. In such cases the pre call module may mute outgoing audio other than the ring tone on the operator device to prevent the subject from recognizing that the call is being recorded or monitored. If the operator desires to communicate with the subject the operator makes a selection on the operator device e.g. within the pre call recording module that causes the ring tone to stop playing for the subject and unmutes outgoing audio from the operator device .

The operator device may receive connection information from the agency service or other entity about a subject device e.g. number information for the subject device dialing a virtual number and the number information for the dialed virtual number. Accordingly the operator may make an informed decision about the subject s identity and the identity expected from the operator i.e. in instances where the operator utilizes multiple virtual numbers . The agency service may further enable the operator or agency to configure multiple virtual numbers to attach to or associated with a single operator device for managing a variety of subjects . In turn the operator may use the single operator device to select which virtual number to use for connecting to a specified subject device over the network without compromising operator identity.

As described above the agency service provisions and configures virtual numbers and handles number information to establish identities for the virtual numbers on the network . In some embodiments the agency service may additionally specify one or more monitoring devices not shown to notify when the operator device or subject device utilizes a virtual number for communications. For example the agency service may maintain a mapping table storing transmitting numbers and authentication information for monitoring devices in associated with the virtual number . When the agency service identifies an operator device requesting to communicate using the virtual number or a subject device attempting to connect to the virtual number the agency service connects the parties while additionally notifying the monitoring device. The notifications themselves may come in different forms and are explained in more detail below.

In the case telephonic communications between the subject device and the operator device the agency service identifies instances when the operator device and the subject device attempt to establish telephonic communications through the virtual number . In turn the agency service may transmit instructions e.g. to a provider to dial out to the monitoring device and connect the monitoring device with the virtual number . Once connected to the virtual number the monitoring device receives the audio data corresponding to a pre call recording period and or subsequent communication between the subject device and operator device through the virtual number . In order to prevent subject suspicion as to the operator s identity audio transmissions from the monitoring device to the virtual number and any audio associated with establishing the connecting between the monitoring device and the virtual number is disabled. If a monitoring device declined to join on the call or requested to only be notified the agency service or provider may transmit or otherwise provide pre call recordings and other recorded call audio and transcripts thereof to the monitoring device. Additionally as portions of the pre call recording may not have been transmitted to the operator device e.g. answering the call through the virtual number after the connection has already been established and the recording already started the agency service or provider may transmit or otherwise provide pre call recordings and other recorded call audio and transcripts thereof to the operator device. Transcripts and pre call recordings may for example be provided via SMS MMS message email or other means such as the pre call recording or a monitoring module. Alternatively a location of the transcript and call audio for streaming from a server e.g. of the agency service may be provided via SMS email or other means such as the pre call recording or a monitoring module.

The network represents the communication pathway between agencies agency service the operator devices subject devices monitoring devices and other entities not shown . In one embodiment the network includes standard communications technologies and or protocols and can include the Internet and PSTN. Oftentimes these communications technologies and or protocols carry both PSTN and Internet related data. Thus the network can include links using technologies such as Ethernet 802.11 worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX 2 G 3 G 4 G mobile communications protocols worldwide interoperability for PSTN communications digital subscriber line DSL asynchronous transfer mode ATM InfiniBand PCI Express Advanced Switching etc. Similarly the networking protocols used on the network can include multiprotocol label switching MPLS the transmission control protocol Internet protocol TCP IP the User Datagram Protocol UDP the hypertext transport protocol HTTP the simple mail transfer protocol SMTP the file transfer protocol FTP etc. The data exchanged over the network can be represented using technologies and or formats including analog audio e.g. for last mile PSTN communications digital audio and video e.g. as a file or streaming with Real Time Streaming Protocol the hypertext markup language HTML the extensible markup language XML JavaScript VBScript FLASH the portable document format PDF etc. In addition all or some of the data exchanged over the network can be encrypted using conventional encryption technologies such as secure sockets layer SSL transport layer security TLS virtual private networks VPNs Internet Protocol security IPsec etc. In another embodiment the entities on the network can use custom and or dedicated data communications technologies instead of or in addition to the ones described above. For example some government agencies and the military may operate networks auxiliary to the internet and PSTN.

As used herein the term module refers to computer program instructions and or other logic used to provide the specified functionality. Thus a module can be implemented in hardware firmware and or software. In one embodiment program modules formed of executable computer program instructions are stored on a non transitory storage device loaded into memory and executed by a computer processor as one or more processes.

As used herein the terms message messaging and short messaging service SMS each comprise the breadth of messaging services and related technologies or standards used for communicating and transmitting data over the network . These technologies and services include SMS messages multimedia messaging service MMS messages proprietary messaging service messages such as BLACKBERRY messages BBM and the like.

Agency represents a collection of servers desktop notebook or tablet computers mobile telephones and related storage mediums used by respective agency personnel for executing applications or modules to communicate with and receive data from the agency service e.g. via the interface and other entities on the network . For example agency devices may execute a web browser to access a web interface or execute a mobile or desktop application for communicating with an API provided by the agency service . An agency may also include telephonic and video infrastructure enabling audio and video communicability e.g. internally and or over the network using the public switched telephone network PTSN voice over internet protocol VoIP and video conferencing services for monitoring or specifying configurations for using operator devices with virtual numbers .

The telephony network may include servers switches and other hardware and software for implementing among other protocols and technologies worldwide interoperability for PSTN communications including land lines and 2 G 3 G 4 G wireless protocols. The telephony network also provides mobile devices with the capability to transmit and receive data over the internet . The telephony network is managed by one or more communication service providers CSPs not shown that own telephone numbers for use on the PSTN and the CSPs own network e.g. a wireless network that communicates with the PSTN .

The provider may include servers switches and other hardware and software for communicating over the network with CSPs and other entities. The provider buys or leases numbers for use on the telephony network from multiple CSPs. The provider in turn manages numbers provisioned for use by the agency service and the telephony traffic associated with the numbers. In one embodiment the provider allows the agency service to provision one or more of the numbers as virtual numbers over the network .

Typically a number used on the telephony network directs to a given mobile device VoIP device or land line device having an associated number identity characterized by automatic number identification ANI information or caller identification. Virtual numbers while still operable with the PSTN and CSP networks are associated with the provider who handles telephony traffic for the number. Because a virtual number does not direct to an end user device the provider may establish connections with devices dialing the virtual number record call information such as call audio and caller history e.g. on a computer readable medium and stream provide call information for download e.g. over the network .

The provider may also pass bridge audio bidirectional or unidirectional in real time between two or more telephonic devices establishing connections with the same or different virtual numbers or connected by the provider via a virtual number . Additionally as the virtual numbers are handled by the provider the agency service may modify ANI information and caller identification associated with the virtual number.

In addition to provisioning virtual numbers for the agency service the provider communicates notifications and data associated with the virtual numbers to the agency service or other entity such as the agency . For example the provider may notify the agency service and optionally an operator device or monitoring device of an incoming caller to the virtual number and receive instructions from the agency service to connect the caller to the virtual number or another device and whether to initiate a pre call recording. In a specific example the agency service may provide instructions for the provider to notify a monitoring device e.g. C in response to use of the virtual number by either the operator device or subject device . The provider in turn may dial out to the monitoring device C via the virtual number or other virtual number and pass or bridge audio such that the monitoring device C receives the audio transmissions between the operator device and subject device or monitors a pre call recording on the virtual number. The provider may also receive instructions to stop start recordings of calls placed to the virtual number and interface with a transcription service to transcribe call audio. In turn the provider can transmit the recordings and transcripts to the agency service or other entity on the network .

Additionally the provider may enable or disable inbound and or outbound audio for different parties such as a monitoring device C or operator connected or connecting to a virtual number and recordings thereof responsive to instructions received e.g. via an API from the agency service or operator e.g. via a key press . The provider can receive instructions for managing a virtual number and notifications as part of the provisioning process prior to an incoming call or in real time from the agency service when connecting an incoming caller to the virtual number. In some embodiments the provider communicates directly with the agency operating device and or monitoring device to provision virtual numbers transmit notifications and data or receive instructions. Additionally the provider itself may function as a CSP and vice versa.

The agency service receives requests for provisioning and mapping virtual number from the agency operator device or monitoring device . The requests can include number information for provisioning virtual numbers such as an area code e.g. 555 country code e.g. 44 and or associated CSP. In turn the agency service queries the provider for available virtual numbers matching the request and returns the matching virtual numbers to the requesting entity. The agency service subsequently receives a selection of virtual numbers from the requesting entity and claims the virtual numbers from the provider .

When provisioning a virtual number the agency service may optionally allow the entity to specify number information such as ANI and or caller identification associated with the virtual number to spoof the number s identity on the network . The agency service in turn transmits instructions to the provider for modifying the number identity. The agency service may optionally verify the spoofed number identity. When a virtual number is no longer needed by the agency A the agency service obtains any audio recordings or call logs associated with the virtual number and releases the number back to the provider .

Additionally the agency service may optionally allow the entity to specify number information such as a ring tone for provisioned virtual numbers. The specified ring tone may be used to spoof the location where the number is being used on the network or mimic a custom ringtone when played for the subject. Specifically as ring tones can differ between countries and for a host of other reasons the agency service may enable the entity to configure the virtual number with the provider such that a specified ring tone is played when parties e.g. a subject attempt to communicate with the operator using the virtual number. In a real world example if the virtual number is based in the United Kingdom and the subject expects the operator using the virtual number to be in the United States the subject may hear incorrectly the ring tone for the United Kingdom when dialing the virtual number rather than the expected United States ring tone . Accordingly the agency service may provide the entity with a list of ring tones e.g. for different countries and or enable the entity to upload a desired ring tone for playback to those dialing the virtual number. The agency service in turn transmits instructions to the provider for configuring the virtual number with the desired ring tone for playback. Thus the cover of the operator may be maintained when the subject dials the virtual number and a pre call recording is generated the operator covertly monitors audio from the subject device .

The requests can also include mapping information for configuring claimed virtual number function in a mapping table. Depending on the desired configuration the mapping information may include the transmitting number of an operator device and or and monitoring device virtual number for association with the device and or desired function of the virtual number such as whether to generate a pre call recording when a subject dials the virtual number in an attempt to communicate with the operator device and any specific ring tone that should be played back to the subject device. One example mapping request may specify a claimed virtual number for use as a virtual number that the operator device connects to in order to transmit collected data e.g. audio over the telephony network from the virtual number s identity e.g. to subject devices . Another example mapping request may specify that pre call recordings should be generated when a subject dials the claimed virtual number. In response to the request the agency service associates the transmitting number of the operator device with the virtual number and stores the association in a mapping table and also indicate in the mapping table whether calls should be pre recorded.

In some embodiments a mapping request may optionally include the transmitting number of a monitoring device which the agency service associates with a virtual number to identify the monitoring device. As multiple monitoring devices A B C may monitor call audio the agency service may store multiple transmitting numbers of monitoring devices in association with a single virtual number in a mapping table.

Embodiments of the mapping table may also indicate whether a specific ring tone should be used when a subject device attempts to communicate with the operator device through the virtual number . Additionally embodiments of the mapping table may also identify functions to perform in response to commands from the operator device. For example when generating a pre call recording and the operator device connects to the virtual number to monitor audio covertly received from the subject device the operator may key 1 to unmute call audio from the operator device stop playing the ringtone and subsequently communicate with the subject device .

In practice agency service consults the mapping table to automatically identify a device connecting to a virtual number as the operator device monitoring device or subject device based on the device s transmitting number. Thus for example an operator of an operator device may dial a virtual number mapped to the transmitting number of his phone to place a call from the virtual number e.g. to a subject device . Additionally the operator of an operator device may receive calls from the subject by way of the subject device connecting to the virtual number and the mapping table identifying the operator device the agency service should instruct the provider to dial out to.

Embodiments of the agency service use the mapping of the operator device and pre call recording selection for a virtual number for instructing the provider to automatically connect the subject device on the virtual number begin generating a recording and play a ring tone to the subject device. In turn the mapping of the operator device to the virtual number may be used to dial out to the operator device to listen in on the call. Additionally embodiments of the agency service use the mapping of the operator device to virtual numbers for identifying when the operator device desires to use a virtual number and instructing the provider to dial e.g. from a virtual number a subject device specified by the operator and connect the parties. The agency service may also provide operating devices with caller and virtual number details through the interface via SMS message or email.

Additionally embodiments of the agency service can use the mapping of monitoring devices to virtual numbers e.g. directly of via an associated virtual number for instructing the provider to automatically dial e.g. from a specified virtual number or the virtual number or otherwise notify e.g. a SMS message monitoring devices when pre recordings are generated and calls are placed or received using a given virtual number. The agency service may also notify monitoring devices through the interface or via email.

To prohibit unauthorized access to virtual numbers the agency service may allow personnel and operators to specify key ins when provisioning and or mapping virtual numbers. The agency service stores the key ins in the mapping table or other suitable database structure to identify and authenticate callers attempting connections to the virtual numbers responsive to correct key ins. Depending on the embodiment the agency agency service or provider may store the mapping table and or key ins for device identification and authentication.

In some embodiments the agency service provides a pre call module to the operator device . The pre call module interfaces with the native dialer of the operator device to automate the connection process to a given subject device for pre call recording. The pre call module may transmit the collected data over the network back to the agency service or other entity. The agency service in turn may store the collected data for transmission to one or more monitoring devices and the agency . Furthermore the pre call module may be configured with a password or otherwise disguised when executed to prevent users other than the operator from accessing the module altogether and or particular features. The pre call module is described in more detail with reference to .

In some embodiments the agency service includes an interface for providing recorded pre calls either on the virtual number or received from the operator device and call audio between operators and subjects to various monitoring devices and or appliances over the network . For example the interface may provide monitoring devices with data corresponding to the status e.g. connected or disconnected of one or more operator devices and the corresponding virtual number and subject device information. If the operator device is transmitting real time data or connected to a subject device the interface can stream data such as audio from the active transmission GPS coordinates with heading speed and coordinates of last reported locations for placement on a map and the internet protocol address and or telephone numbers of other personnel monitoring or having access to the operator device or virtual number. In some embodiments the interface syncs collected data prior to transmission or includes tags in the transmitted data for synchronization of playback at the monitoring device or operator device . The interface can also stream or provide for download previously recorded monitoring sessions.

In some embodiments the agency service provides a monitoring module to monitoring devices for accessing the interface . The monitoring module transmits requests associated with configuring an operator device and receiving real time and historic data. For example the monitoring module may provide a user interface or status dashboard with options for provisioning virtual numbers mapping a transmitting number of an operator device or monitoring device to a given virtual number and configuring pre call recordings on a virtual number. In one embodiment the dashboard provides an option to toggle a pre call recording session or bi directional recording session on or off with the agency service . When a recording session is disabled the monitoring device or operator device still receives real time data but the agency service appliance and provider do not store copies of the collected data.

The monitoring module may also display real time status information for the operator device including current GPS location tracked GPS location live audio mapping table information and other information collected from the operator device operator device or virtual number and streamed by the interface . Similarly the monitoring module may be used to access and playback historic activity associated with a given virtual number or operator device . For example the monitoring module may download files such as pre call recordings for playback or stream them. In addition to interfacing with the agency service the monitoring module may interface with an appliance that stores or backs up collected data within the agency .

The monitoring module may interface with the native dialer of the monitoring device and notify the monitor when connection requests from virtual numbers are received e.g. in instances where the monitoring device is dialed in to monitor a call . Embodiments of the monitoring module may also be configured to automatically establish the connection with the virtual number. The monitoring module may display information for the virtual number and optionally the subject device and or operator device using the virtual number with the notification. Displayed information for the virtual number operator device and or subject device may include associated number information mapping information and or case information stored at the agency service provider and or appliance . For example the monitoring module may communicate with the agency service and or appliance to receive mapping information and case information corresponding to Virtual numbers and operating devices the transmitting number of the monitoring device executing the monitoring module is authorized to monitor. Additionally the monitoring module may include functionality of the pre call module and vice versa.

In one embodiment the agency includes an appliance for storing data such as pre call recordings collected by operator devices and virtual numbers. The appliance may utilize the monitoring interface provided by the agency service for updating stored data or receive data directly from operator devices . Additionally the appliance may receive audio recorded on a virtual number and associated transcripts from the provider or agency service . One example embodiment of the appliance also includes its own interface not shown that enables monitoring devices and operator device to access real time and historic data stored on the appliance for a virtual number. Interfaces provided by the agency service or appliance may also be accessible via a web browser for streaming or downloading data and include the same or similar options.

Additionally the appliance and agency service may communicate to intermittently update collected data and records at defined intervals or in response to notifications to download data. During the intervals or notification periods the agency service may process the data and perform any necessary actions as desired by operator devices or monitoring device until the data is transferred to the appliance . In some embodiments the agency service maintains a persistent connection with the appliance to facilitate transfer of real time data collected by operator devices operated in the field.

In one embodiment the agency service ensures that it and the provider do not possess data collected by operator devices or from a virtual number beyond the time needed to facilitate transfer. However in mission critical situations operators and other agency personnel cannot rely only on the availability of the appliance for storing and maintaining collected data. Consequently if the appliance is unable to take possession of the collected data or go offline during transfer the agency service and or the provider may maintain possession of the collected data until the appliance is functioning. Furthermore the agency service and or provider may determine whether checksums hashes or sizes of transferred data match the appliance s version prior to deleting stored data.

In some embodiments the agency service maintains an appliance instead of or in addition to the agency . In such cases the appliance may exist as a dedicated piece of hardware or remote storage. Alternatively embodiments of the appliance may be implemented in a cloud computing and storage stack available on the network .

The provisioning module interfaces with the provider or agency service to provision virtual numbers and modify virtual number assignments and function in the field. Alternatively a web browser on the operator device may be used. For example the web browser accessing interface at the agency service or provisioning module may present the operator with a list of all virtual numbers associated with a given account transmitting number or virtual number. Through the interface or provisioning module the operator may provision and modify mapping and function of the virtual numbers such as whether to pre call record a subject. Additionally for example the operator may specify number information for a virtual number or specify a ring tone for playback when the virtual number is dialed.

The connection module automates the connection process for generating a pre call recording and connecting to a subject when the operator device is dialed directly. For example the connection module may immediately establish a connection and mute the operator device. Additionally the connection module may interface with the tone module to play a ring tone on the line for the subject and the recording module to generate the pre call recording. The connection module may also include functions for mimicking a dropped call or a busy line signal in response to an operator s selection. In such cases the connection module interfaces with the tone module and the recording module to play the appropriate tone and record the subject. The subject need not be recorded for the operator to listen in on the real time audio received from the subject. If the operator does not answer the phone the connection module may mimic a voicemail box as the subject would normally expect.

In another embodiment the connection module may be configured to forward directly dialed calls from numbers other than the virtual number to the virtual number by entering the call forwarding command. For example 21 Virtual Number may be used to forward all incoming calls to the Virtual Number which may in turn handle the pre call recording process. With call forwarding activated when the subject dials the operator device the call is immediately and undetectably forwarded to the virtual number where the provider can begin call recording and play a ringing sound back to the subject. At this point the operator device specified in the mapping table receives a connection request from the virtual number. In some embodiments number information for the subject may be displayed instead of the virtual number such that the operator can identify the subject s transmitting number. The device receiving the call at this stage may differ from the one originally dialed based on the device information specified in the mapping table.

In one embodiment to prevent an infinite forwarding loop where a call made to the operator device from the virtual number is forwarded to the virtual number back to the operator device back to the virtual number and so on. the operator may elect to use conditional Call Forwarding Busy Rejected by entering for example 67 Virtual Number . With conditional call forwarding when the subject dials the operator device the operator device will ring then the operator may reject it manually by pressing Reject Call to forward the connection request through the virtual number. The connection module may detect the initial incoming connection request from the subject device and automatically reject the connection request to route the subject device through the virtual number. For example the connection module may reject the first incoming call automatically but display the second on the operator device for the operator to act on to connect to the subject device through the virtual number. The rejection is the condition that forwards the incoming connection request to the virtual number which in turn forwards the call back to the operator device . This time the second incoming call within a brief period is answered by the operator to covertly listen to the subject device. Pre call recording begins when the first rejected call is routed by way of the rejection through the virtual number.

The connection module may interface with the agency service to receive information about virtual numbers associated with a given virtual number or the transmitting number of the operator device . The connection module may then present an interface to the operator indicating one or more available virtual numbers with their number information for selection and whether pre call recordings are generated.

In one embodiment the connection module detects whether incoming calls were initially placed to a virtual number. The connection module subsequently determines virtual number and or subject device information for display to the operator. In one embodiment the connection module accesses a locally or remotely stored address book to retrieve an address book entry associated with the virtual number and or subject device . Alternatively the connection module may receive and display notifications from the agency service or provider about incoming calls. Based on the notification or address book information the operator may review the appropriate identity expected by the subject and or the subject. Because pre call recordings on the virtual number may be managed by the agency and or provider the connection module may not perform a local pre call recording sequence for the incoming call. However the connection module may display to the operator available options for the connection and transmit selections to the agency service and or provider on the telephonic connection or via a separate connection e.g. over the internet . Specific options for selection include whether the operator would like to open bi direction connection with the subject send the subject to voicemail drop the call or perform another function described herein.

Depending on the operator device s capabilities the connection module may enable placement receipt of multiple outgoing and incoming calls to virtual and non virtual numbers within the native dialer application or similar dialer displayed by the connection module.

The tone module stores tones that may be played back to the subject device . Additionally the tone module may transmit tones to the agency service or provider for playback when the subject connects to a virtual number or when the operator device desires to perform a particular function as described herein.

The caller ID module interfaces with the provider or agency services to modify caller ID or other number information associated with provisioned virtual numbers. For example the caller ID module presents an interface to the operator to specify number information such as location ownership carrier and whether or not any of the information should be restricted or blocked when dialing out to the subject device from a given virtual number.

The recording module stores call recordings on the operator device for direct connection pre call recordings. The recording module may also retrieve pre call recordings that were generated on the virtual number. In one embodiment the recording module retrieves a transcript of pre call recording audio for the operator s review.

In some embodiments the pre call module and the modules therein interface and communicate with non native devices attached to the operator device . For example audio data can be determined from accessories coupled e.g. wired microphone or wirelessly connected e.g. Bluetooth headset to the operator device .

Additionally some or all of the features provided by the Pre call module may require the operator to enter a specified key in e.g. button press combination password or other personal identification prior to operation or launch.

With one or more virtual numbers claimed the agency service can receive mapping requests for the virtual numbers and in turn map the virtual numbers responsive to information in the mapping request. For example the requestor may be prompted to enter the transmitting number of an operator device for association with a virtual number and whether call from subject devices connecting to the virtual number should be pre call recorded. The agency service stores the transmitting number of the operator device and the Virtual number in a mapping table e.g. at the agency service or on the appliance . The requestor may modify the mapping at any time without any interruption of service at the receiving number.

Example embodiments of monitoring device mapping to virtual numbers and or virtual numbers can be performed in the same or similar fashion as operator device mappings. Monitoring device mapping to virtual number and or virtual numbers may be used to authorize monitoring devices to listen in on call audio between an operator device and subject device . Additionally the mapping may be used to automatically notify a specified monitoring device when the corresponding Virtual number is used for communications.

When the agency service receives information from the provider about connection requests to virtual numbers A from the network the agency service identifies the connecting device as the operator device based on the transmitting number A stored in the mapping table A. In turn the agency service or provider receives a subject number from the operator device and dials the corresponding subject from the Virtual number A. If the connecting device s number does not match the transmitting number A the agency service identifies the device as a subject device and checks the mapping table pre call record instruction to determine whether to initiate the pre call recording process for the virtual number. If no pre call record should be generated the agency service dials or instructs the provider to dial the specified transmitting number for the operating device . In some embodiments the mapping table A may include an option to covertly record the operator device e.g. that of an informant when placing a call to the subject on the virtual number and hide the pre call recording sequence of the subject from the informant.

In some embodiments the mapping table A further includes mappings of monitoring device transmitting numbers to explicitly identify authorized monitoring devices in addition to operating devices .

When the agency service receives connection requests to virtual numbers C from the network the agency service may identify the connecting device as a subject device or operator device using for example mapping table A. The agency service enables operator devices to specify a subject device for dialing out to from the virtual number C and also manages connect requests from subject devices to communicate with the operator device corresponding to the dialed virtual number C and whether to generate a pre call recoding. In either instance the agency service may identify one or more monitoring numbers associated with the Virtual number C. The agency service in turn may automatically instruct the provider to dial out to the identified monitoring numbers when the virtual number C is used such that the monitoring devices may receive pre recordings and call audio.

In the embodiment shown in the agency service may instruct the provider to dial out from the virtual number C or otherwise connect the monitoring device with the virtual number C. In such cases audio transmitted from the monitoring device or associated with connection process e.g. any dial tones to the virtual number C may be disabled.

For any device or dialing the virtual number the provider receives the connection request via the telephony network and identifies the dialed number as a virtual number provisioned by agency service . Accordingly in embodiments where the agency service stores the mapping table the provider passes the transmitting number of the device attempting to connect to the virtual number and the virtual number to the agency service .

The agency service in turn identifies the device attempting to connect to the virtual number as an operator device monitoring device or subject based on the mapping table. The agency service in turn instructs the provider to connect or disconnect the identified device and provide options or perform operations according to the device s classification.

In one embodiment the agency service identifies devices with numbers that do not match a transmitting number stored in the mapping table for a virtual number as subject devices . The agency service determines whether to make a pre call recording based on the mapping table. To generate a pre call recording the agency service instructs the provider to connect the subject device to the virtual number and record audio on the line. In turn the agency service identifies the transmitting number associated with the virtual number and instructs the provider to attempt to connect the subject device to the operator device e.g. by dialing out to the operator device directly or through the virtual number . In some embodiments the agency service may identify a monitoring number of a monitoring device associated with the virtual number in the mapping table. The agency service in turn may instruct the provider establish a connection with the monitoring device for passing pre call audio and call audio between the subject device and the operator device on the virtual number.

In the case of the operator device dialing a virtual number the agency service determines that the transmitting number stored in the mapping table for the dialed virtual number matches the number of the device attempting to connect to the virtual number. The agency service then instructs the provider to connect the device to the virtual number as the operator device .

Once the operator device connects to the desired Virtual number e.g. via selection or directly the operator may enter the number of the subject device e.g. transmitting number of the subject s device that the operator would like to dial from the Virtual number. The provider in turn dials out to the subject number from the Virtual number displaying Virtual number information and connects the parties. In some embodiments the agency service may identify a monitoring number of a monitoring device associated with the Virtual number or virtual number in the mapping table. The agency service in turn may instruct the provider establish a connection with the monitoring device for passing call audio between the subject device and the operator device on the virtual number.

In some embodiments the agency service may identify the operator device and determine to make a pre call recording of the operator device while dialing out to the subject device. In such cases the agency service instructs the provider to begin generating a pre call recording of audio received from the operator device when the operator device is connected to the virtual number.

In the case of a monitoring device dialing a Virtual number the agency service may determine that a transmitting number for a monitoring device stored in the mapping table for the dialed Virtual number matches the number of the device. The agency service then instructs the provider to connect the device to the virtual number as a monitoring device and disable e.g. mute audio received from the monitoring device .

In some embodiments the PSTN or provider fails to pass the transmitting number associated with an operator device or monitoring device to the provider or agency service . For example the provider or agency service may receive a number other than the operator device s and incorrectly identify the operator device. Some example PSTN and provider failures are all zeroes numbers 00 000 000 0000 restricted numbers 737 874 2833 or simply an incorrect number for the operator device . In any instance the agency service may be unable to identify the operator device by the received transmitting number.

The agency service may recognize that some numbers are passed incorrectly e.g. a restricted number or zeroes number . In response e.g. for calls to a virtual number the agency service may play a prompt or instruct the provider to play a prompt such as press 1 for an operator device or press 2 for a monitoring device. The prompt can also be ambiguous e.g. please enter the extension of the party you are trying to reach or similar . Operators or personnel may then key in as using an operator device or monitoring device .

Alternatively as the key ins of the operator device and monitoring device typically differ the agency service may instruct the provider to simply play a generic tone or number not available recording to notify users that they need to key in. The matching of a key in with stored authentication information identifies the operator device or monitoring device on the virtual number.

In some embodiments the agency service may prompt all devices connecting the virtual number to key in for identification. For example an agency A may want to enable the option to use unmapped devices as operator devices on a specified virtual number.

While prompts are effective for identification on a virtual number e.g. as only operators and personnel typically have knowledge of the number and it may further require key in of a PIN these methods are ineffective for number pass failures to virtual numbers as subjects typically must be tricked into believing they are making a legitimate confidential call when they as opposed to the operator device or monitoring device dial the Virtual number. Accordingly PSTN or provider failures to pass the transmitting number associated with a device making a call to a virtual number may be handled differently.

In one embodiment the agency service may instruct the provider to begin the dial out process as if the unidentified device were a subject device . Once the dial out begins the operator or monitor will realize that their device was not recognized e.g. because no menu was presented or prompt was played and the provider is dialing out . A subject on the other hand would assume operation as normal. In order to capitalize on this difference the agency service may instruct the provider to capture a key in during the dialing process for identifying the requesting device as a monitoring device or operator device . The requesting device is then identified and connected with the virtual number according to the provided key in.

The agency service may transmit the ring tone audio or otherwise instruct the provider to generate the selected ring tone on the virtual number. In turn the agency service instructs the provider to connect the subject device to the virtual number. The subject device connects to the virtual number and hears the generated ring tone still believing the call is being connected. Meanwhile the provider records or otherwise provides call audio on the line from the subject device to the agency service for generating the pre call recording and dials out to the operator device .

The agency service previously instructed the provider to connect the subject device to the virtual number but continue to play a ring tone on the line after establishing the connection and record pre call audio from the subject device. In effect the subject device is connected to the virtual number but does not know a connection has already been established because the ring tone is still playing nor is the subject aware that a pre call recording of audio on the line is being generated. Temporally proximate to establishing the connection between the subject device and the virtual number the provider dials out to the provided transmitting number of the operator device . Notification information identifying the virtual number information and subject device information may be transmitted to the operator device by the agency service and or provider . The agency service further transmits instructions to the provider for connecting the operator device to the virtual number when the operator answers the call. Specifically in one embodiment the agency service transmits instructions to the provider that causes the provider to establish the connection between the operator device and the virtual number with the operator device muted on the line and the ring tone still playing for the subject device . If the operator does not answer the call the provider may generate audio on the line corresponding to a voicemail recording. The pre recording may continue until the subject hangs up e.g. after leaving a voicemail.

The operator may answer the call to listen to the collected audio data . The operator may subsequently provide an instruction to being communicating with the subject device. An instruction e.g. a key in to begin the call and end the pre recording process is shown. Other instructions may cause the provider to imitate a voicemail box for the subject device busy signal or disconnection. In one embodiment a pre call recording module executing on the operator device provides an interface from which the operator may select the desired operation and transmit the corresponding instruction to the agency service and or provider .

If the provider receives the instruction to begin the call and end the pre call recording process the provider stops the ring tone played for the subject device and establishes bi direction communication between the operator device and the subject device on the virtual number.

In another embodiment where the agency does not want an operator such as an informant made aware of the pre call recording process the agency service and provider may skip steps and when the operator device establishes the connection to the virtual number. In such cases the operator device accepting the connection request causes the process to move to step to establish communications and end the pre call recording along with ring tone playback to the subject device. Additionally in some embodiments the provider may receive instructions for the operator device to generate another covert recording of the subject device. For example the operator device may transmit an instruction causing the provider to mimic that the operator device was dropped from the call.

Once the bi direction communication between the operator device and the subject device is established the provider may continue to record call audio on the line. The operator device collects audio data using a microphone coupled to the operator device. The operator device in turn transmits the collected audio data to the provider and subject device by way of the connection through the virtual number. The subject device communicates with the operator device in a similar fashion. The provider may additionally enable monitoring devices to connect to the virtual number to monitor the call and or transmit the audio data received from the operator device and the subject device to the agency service or appliance over the network .

The provider and or the agency service may update an appliance with the received audio data. The agency service or provider may also update the appliance with any other data received from the provider and or operator device .

In some embodiments the agency service may instruct the provider to automatically dial in a monitoring device for receiving re call recording and call audio between the operator device and subject device . The agency service may identify monitoring devices to dial in based on mapping table information for example as illustrated in .

In one embodiment the agency service detects the initiation of a dial out using a virtual number. For example the agency service may detect when dial out instructions are transmitted to the provider or processed at the provider to perform a dial out. The dial out instructions may comprise instructions for the provider to establish a connection between a contract device and operator device using a virtual number. For example as shown in the agency service may detect when the provider receives the dial out number transmitted after identification in the mapping table or when the provider connects a subject device to the virtual number to generate a pre call recording and begins to dial out to the operator device .

Once the agency service detects the initiation of a dial out by way of a virtual number the agency service identifies any monitoring numbers associated with the virtual number in the mapping table e.g. as shown in . In turn the agency service transmits instructions to the provider for dialing in the monitoring device to receive pre call and call audio on the Virtual number. The agency service may identify multiple monitoring numbers and transmit instructions enabling multiple monitoring device to receive call audio.

The provider receives the instructions and establishes a connection with the monitoring device . For example the provider may dial in the monitoring device from the virtual number associated with the monitoring number transmitting number of the monitoring device. While the monitoring device is being dialed in a connection for generating a pre call recording of subject device may be in the process of being established or already established. In either instance the provider may disable audio from the monitoring device such that the subject is or will be unaware of the monitor s presence on the line. The monitoring device may also dial the virtual number to listen in on the call at any time.

In some instance the connection with the monitoring device may be established after the connection between the subject device and operator device has ended for example the call between the subject and operator lasts only 10 seconds and the monitor answers the dial in at 13 seconds. In turn the agency service and or the provider may inform the monitor of the status of the connection between the subject device and the operator device and optionally playback pre call recordings and call audio.

The agency service and or the provider may prompt the monitor to enter a key in or key selection within a predetermined period of time from initiating the dial in . For example when establishing the connection the monitor may be required to Press 1 to join the call in progress e.g. in response to an audible prompt where pressing 1 causes the provider to connect the monitoring device . Providing the key in or key selection indicates to the provider that the monitor is on the line and optionally authenticates the monitor. Failure to provide the key in or key selection within the predetermined period of time may cause the provider to terminate the connection thus preventing a partial conversation between the subject and operator from being saved to the monitor s voicemail or an unauthorized person from monitoring the call.

Additionally a monitoring module may interface with the native dialer of the monitoring device and notify the monitor when a dial in is received . The monitoring module may display information associated with the dial in such as number information for the parties and Virtual number being used mapping information and or case information including pre call and other recordings stored at the agency service provider and or appliance . For example the monitoring module may communicate with the agency service and or appliance to receive mapping information and case information corresponding to Virtual numbers and operating devices the transmitting number of the monitoring device executing the monitoring module is authorized to monitor.

In some instances the monitoring device receives notifications from the monitoring interface for display in the web browser or with the monitoring module . Example notifications include audio or visual alerts for notifying personnel if the operator device stops transmitting real time data e.g. ends the call .

First incoming connection requests from a subject device to an operator device are identified. A ring tone for playback to the subject device is determined for imitating that a connection between the subject device and operator device is still being established. In some embodiments a virtual number may be used to establish a connection to the subject device . The determined ring tone is generated on the virtual number or by the operator device prior to or simultaneous to establishing the connection with the subject device and muting outgoing audio other than the ring tone in some embodiments from the operator device. During this time period the subject believes a connection is still in the process of being established while the operator or other entity may monitor and or record pre call audio.

When the operator desires to communicate with the subject the operator may provide a selection on the operator device to stop the ring tone on the virtual number or generated by the pre call recording module and unmute outgoing audio from the operator to the subject. Alternatively for pre calls recorded through a virtual number the pre call recording and playback of the ring tone may end once the operator answers the forwarded call and or initially when picking up the call to establish the connection through the virtual number e.g. automatically upon answering .
