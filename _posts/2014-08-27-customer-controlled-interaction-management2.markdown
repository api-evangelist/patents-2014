This application is related to U.S. application entitled SOCIAL MEDIA INTEGRATED AGENT ROUTING filed on even date herewith Ser. No. 14 470 913 the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.

Typical processing of interactions between a customer and a contact center are generally under the control of the contact center. For example the contact center generally selects the agent to which an inbound outbound interaction from to a customer is to be routed. Although contact centers do employ certain business driven customization and personalization such customization and personalization generally sides with the interests of the business.

There are some instances where the customer has access to a direct phone line of the customer s preferred agent and may therefore be in control of the agent with whom the customer ultimately interacts. However even in this scenario the customer runs the risk of dialing blindly without knowledge of the availability of the agent to answer the call.

Accordingly what is need is a system and method for providing a customer at least partial control of interactions with a contact center.

Embodiments of the present invention are directed to system and method for managing interactions of a customer contact center. The system includes a processor and a memory. The memory has stored therein instructions that when executed by the processor cause the processor to execute the following acts. The processor receives a request to reserve a contact center resource for handling an interaction. The processor also receives data about the interaction. The processor identifies a routing point for routing the interaction based on the received data. The routing point is associated with routing logic controlled by a customer instead of the contact center. The processor routes the interaction to the identified routing point for giving the customer control of the routing of the interaction.

According to one embodiment the interaction is a telephony interaction and the system includes a switch that is coupled to the processor for establishing a voice path between the end user device and a device of the contact center resource.

According to one embodiment the processor transmits a software application to the customer end user device over a communications network where the software application includes instructions for executing the routing logic.

According to one embodiment the software application monitors presence of the contact center resource.

According to one embodiment the software application includes instructions for receiving the presence information from a contact center server.

According to one embodiment the software application is transmitted to the customer end user device in response to identifying the customer as belonging to a particular customer segment.

According to one embodiment the interaction is a telephony interaction and the software application invokes a dialer for initiating the telephony interaction.

According to one embodiment the software application provides an interface for prompting the customer to configure the routing logic.

According to one embodiment the software application provides an interface for prompting the customer to identify one or more preferred contact center agents.

According to one embodiment the software application provides an interface for prompting the customer to rate the interaction.

According to one embodiment the software application is configured to share the rating with other customers.

These and other features aspects and advantages of the present invention will be more fully understood when considered with respect to the following detailed description appended claims and accompanying drawings. Of course the actual scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims.

In general terms embodiments of the present invention are directed to a system and method for customer controlled interaction management CCIM where a customer is given control of interactions with a contact center where such control would typically reside with the contact center. According to one embodiment the control exercised by the customer is the routing of interactions to contact center resources e.g. agents . In giving a customer CCIM for an interaction the contact center exposes real time status information of certain resources of the contact center such as for example presence information of certain agents of the contact center. Based on this information the customer dictates when to initiate the interaction and the selection of the agent to whom the interaction is to be routed. In this regard the traditional role of the contact center business and the customer are reversed. Instead of the contact center acting in the best interest of the contact center the customer controls interactions according to his best interest.

According to one embodiment CCIM eligibility may be given for certain types of customers such as for example customers deemed to be important to the contact center. For example CCIM eligibility may be given to customers in certain customer segments e.g. customers labeled as Gold customers . In some embodiments CCIM eligibility may be provided as compensation for bad customer service experience. Also in some embodiments CCIM eligibility may be revoked by the contact center.

By enabling CCIM for Gold customers the need for agent reservation for such customers is reduced if not eliminated. CCIM may allow such a Gold customer to experience the same or even better customer experience than what would be achieved by having dedicated reserved agents for such customers while at the same time avoiding the risk of such reserved agents sitting idle when there is traffic overload for other agents. CCIM also allows the reduction or avoidance of call parking queuing at the business by establishing the call only when the desired agent is actually available. If there is some waiting involved for a CCIM session it may not count towards meeting the business service level allowing service compliance for CCIM sessions to be relaxed.

According to one embodiment the end user device may be a communication device conventional in the art such as for example a smart phone laptop desktop electronic tablet and or the like. A customer operating the end user device may initiate manage and respond to telephone calls emails chats text messaging web browsing sessions and other multi media transactions via the end user device.

According to one embodiment the end user device includes a client interaction iXn controller vendor relationship management VRM module and data storage device . The client iXn controller may be configured with logic to initiate interactions and manage control and or assist a customer in the CCIM of those interactions. The client iXn controller may further be configured to communicate with the contact center system including the associated business and or vendor to exchange data to enable facilitate the CCIM. Exemplary data that may be exchanged is presence data of agents at the contact center.

According to one embodiment the client iXn controller is also equipped with capability e.g. a tool or application to develop control logic for CCIM at the customer side. The control logic may include a customized routing logic. The client iXn controller may also be equipped for customer side case management knowledge management recording and or reporting.

In an exemplary use case a customer that is identified as being appropriate for CCIM capability may be offered to download an application hosting the client iXn controller and or VRM module on the end user device. According to one embodiment the customer may be logged into the business web site. The web site may recognize the customer as being a Gold customer and display a prompt saying to click here if he wants to download the app. The customer may also be identified as a Gold customer during a current interaction with a contact center agent. The agent may ask the customer if the wants to download the app. If the answer is YES the agent may send a link to the customer s end user device e.g. as a text message email or the like that the user may select to perform the download.

The application may be downloaded from an app store from a website of the business and or the like. Once installed the customer may be prompted to configure specific CCIM details such as for example a communication protocol to use in the event that multiple protocols are available. According to one embodiment an available protocol for selection may be a session initiation protocol SIP conventional in the art. Other parameters to be configured may include for example data e.g. information on the customer s preferred agents that is to be shared between the end user device and the contact center system interaction recording options reporting options and the like.

According to one embodiment the customer may be prompted to identify agents that the customer wants to monitor for presence and or customers that the customer wants to add to his preferred agent list. In this regard the customer may be provided with a complete list of agents for the business. The list of agents may be categorized for example based on skills departments and the like. According to one embodiment instead of monitoring presence of individual agents the customer may select to monitor presence of an agent group. In this regard if any member of the group is available the group is identified as being available.

According to one embodiment the customer may be further prompted to generate a personalized routing script for routing interactions for the customer. Templates may be provided to the customer for guiding the customer in setting up the routing script. Default routing scripts may also be provided to the customer if he does not want to set up a personalized one.

The routing script generated for the customer may be configured to replace or plug into the routing script utilized by the contact center. The routing script may also control timing of the interaction target selection e.g. specific agents interaction voice response applications etc. and the like. For example the routing script may be configured to identify an agent or agent group to which to route an interaction. According to one embodiment the customer s personal routing script may be configured to prompt or await specific selection of the agent or agent group by the customer prior to the routing of the interaction.

In some embodiments the routing script may automatically select a preferred agent for a particular interaction. In this regard the routing logic may be configured to connect to the mass storage device to identify ratings of agents e.g. by the customer other customers and the like and select an agent identified to have for example the highest rating. The rating of agents may be adjusted based on past interaction information provided by the customer or other third parties.

In addition to routing scripts the client iXn controller may also provide a tool to develop manage and utilize load other types of scripts. For example dialogue scripts may be generated for guiding the customer during a live conversation with the contact center. The dialogue script may automate certain steps of the conversation such as for example passing personal information about the customer greetings and the like. Scripts may also be generated for granting to the enterprise filtered access to the customer s CCIM data.

According to one embodiment the VRM module includes logic for allowing the customer to not only be in control of customer interactions but also be in control of data exchanged between the customer and different enterprises vendors referred to as vendor relationship management VRM . In this regard the VRM module is configured to communicate with one or more vendor systems associated with one or more businesses such as for example the business for which contact center services are provided via the contact center system to exchange relevant data according to rules set up by the customer. According to one embodiment the term vendor is also intended to encompass the contact center system for which contact center services are provided.

According to one embodiment the VRM module provides a tool to allow the customer to control what kind of data to share when to share and with which businesses to share. The tool may further allow the customer to control the type and timing of data that is received from the various vendors with which the customer has a relationship as is described in further detail in U.S. application Ser. No. 14 201 738 filed on Mar. 7 2014 the content of which is incorporated herein by reference. For example the customer may expose via the VRM module customer account information that will be needed to communicate with certain vendors. The vendors in turn may expose their availability information such as their business hours of the contact center system certain tips on communicating with the vendors and the like.

Part of VRM may include maintaining track of interactions with the vendors including for example interactions controlled by the customer via the client iXn controller and other interactions not controlled by the customer if CCIM is not provided for those interactions. In addition the VRM module may allow the user to maintain personal notes or scores relating to the vendors and individual interactions with such vendors. For example the customer may provide a scoring of service quality and of individual agents. The customer may also keep notes on how to communicate best with a particular company e.g. best media type best timing how to fast track IVR menu and other do s and don ts learned from past experience or from data shared by other customers such as for example via social media. Some of the information may be fed by the vendors themselves. This information may be accessed by the client iXn controller for initiating an interaction with the vendor or during a CCIM session to allow the interaction to progress more efficiently.

The client iXn controller and VRM module are coupled to the mass storage device which may take the form of a disk drive or drive array conventional in the art. The mass storage device may store different types of records such as for example interactions records vendor records configuration data scripts and the like. The vendor records may include VRM details of different vendors with which the customer has relations. For example the vendor records may include without limitation vendor metadata e.g. contact numbers addresses office hours type of business and types of offered services vendor profile or classification e.g. values reflective of the vendor s speed in providing committed service ease of doing business with the vendor and corporate assessment data e.g. risk of bankruptcy assessment of agents with whom the customer has had interaction e.g. satisfaction scores and preference indicators schedules of preferred agents and offered communication channels along with the customer s preference indicators for each offered channel. Each vendor record may also include data on how to improve the customer s interaction experience with the vendor such as for example tricks to fast track IVR dialogue e.g. a series of numbers to press to reach certain departments data that is to be exposed or not to the vendor e.g. last 4 digits of the customer s social security number which is a question that is always asked during an IVR dialogue with the vendor and other data exposed by the vendor or collected from data shared by other customers.

According to one embodiment the interaction records maintained in the mass storage device include without limitation interaction metadata e.g. time parties and service type case reference where each case may include multiple individual interactions e.g. a case reference may be provided to process an accident claim business outcome e.g. sales or credit card offer accepted status of interaction e.g. case closed finished or not finished and customer s annotations e.g. satisfaction ratings or things learned from the experience .

Portions of the data stored in the mass storage device may be shared with the vendor servers contact center system and or other customers according to set rules. For example agent satisfaction scores may be posted onto one or more social media website according to the rules. The data may also be updated from these entities according to set rules.

Although throughout this discussion the client iXn controller and VRM module are assumed to be separate functional units a person of skill in the art should recognize that the functionality of these units may be combined or integrated into a single component or further subdivided into further sub units without departing from the spirit of the invention. According to one embodiment the client iXn controller and VRM module are locally hosted by the end user device as for example a local application. In other embodiments the controller and module may be hosted in a third party system and accessed in real time by the end user device as a service e.g. over the web during an actual CCIM session. In yet other embodiments a hybrid solution may be provided where the processing logic resides at the end user device but the data stored in the storage device is maintained in a remote computing environment such as for example a cloud computing environment.

Referring now to the contact center system the contact center system includes a contact center CC iXn controller providing logic for the business side CCIM. In this regard the CC iXn controller communicates with the client iXn controller for enabling CCIM of interactions by the customer. For example messages may be exchanged to expose agent presence information to the end user device. The messages may also be for giving control to the client iXn controller for routing an interaction initiated by the customer. In exchanging such messages with the end user device the CC iXn controller further communicates with traditional CC components as described in further detail below.

The contact center system may be deployed in equipment of the corresponding enterprise a third party service provider and or deployed in a remote computing environment such as for example a private or public cloud environment with infrastructure for supporting multiple contact centers for multiple enterprises. The various components of the contact center system may also be distributed across various geographic locations and computing environments and not necessarily contained in a single location computing environment or even computing device.

According to one embodiment an iXn control gateway may be optionally coupled in between the end user device and contact center system . The iXn control gateway may expose an application programming interface API and or protocols for allowing the client iXn controller to exchange messages with the CC iXn controller .

According to one embodiment a single iXn control gateway may be provided for different contact center systems. The functionality of the client iXn controller and or CC iXn controller may reside in the iXn control gateway . The functionality may be accessed by both customers and businesses as a service such as for example software as a service SaaS as a managed service or the like. Both customers and businesses may subscribe to this service. During an actual CCIM session data exchanged via the media and control channels may flow through the iXn control gateway or the session may be conducted directly between the end user device and contact center system in a peer to peer fashion.

In embodiments where CCIM is not provided as a service but is fully owned and operated by the customer e.g. CCIM application running on the customer s mobile device and all business side CCIM is owned and operated by the business directly there may be no need for the iXn control gateway . In this embodiment the CCIM communications between the end user device and contact center system may be peer to peer. Certain components of the contact center such as for example a contact center router may also act as the iXn control gateway .

According to one exemplary embodiment of the invention the switch is coupled to a call server which may for example serve as an adapter or interface between the switch and the remainder of the routing monitoring and other call handling components of the contact center.

The call server may be configured to process PSTN calls VoIP calls and the like. For example the call server may include a session initiation protocol SIP server for processing SIP calls. According to some exemplary embodiments the call server may for example extract data about the customer interaction such as the caller s telephone number often known as the automatic number identification ANI number or the customer s internet protocol IP address or email address and communicate with other CC components and or CC iXn controller in processing the call.

According to one exemplary embodiment of the invention the contact center system further includes an interactive media response IMR server which may also be referred to as a self help system virtual assistant or the like. The IMR server may be similar to an interactive voice response IVR server except that the IMR server is not restricted to voice but may cover a variety of media channels including voice. Taking voice as an example however the IMR server may be configured with an IMR script for querying calling customers on their needs. For example a contact center for a bank may tell callers via the IMR script to press 1 if they wish to get an account balance. If this is the case through continued interaction with the IMR customers may complete service without needing to speak with an agent. The IMR server may also ask an open ended question such as for example How can I help you and the customer may speak or otherwise enter a reason for contacting the contact center.

The routing server may be configured to take appropriate action for processing the call. For example for non CCIM interactions the routing server may use data about the call to determine how the call should be routed. If the call is to be routed to a contact center agent the routing server may select an agent for routing the call based for example on a routing strategy employed by the routing server and further based on information about agent availability skills and other routing parameters provided for example by a statistics server . For CCIM interactions the routing server may pass control of the routing to the client iXn controller or receive instructions from the client iXn controller to route the call.

In some embodiments the routing server may query a customer database which stores information about existing clients such as contact information service level agreement SLA requirements nature of previous customer contacts and actions taken by contact center to resolve any customer issues and the like. The database may be managed by any database management system conventional in the art such as Oracle IBM DB2 Microsoft SQL server Microsoft Access PostgreSQL MySQL FoxPro and SQLite and may be stored in a mass storage device . The routing server may query the customer information from the customer database via an ANI or any other information collected by the IMR .

According to one embodiment the statistics server or a separate present server may be configured to provide agent availability information to all subscribing clients. Such clients may include for example the routing server CC iXn controller and or client iXn controller .

Upon identification of an agent to whom to route the call a connection is made between the caller and an agent device collectively referenced as of the identified agent. Received information about the caller and or the caller s historical information may also be provided to the agent device for aiding the agent in better servicing the call. In this regard each agent device may include a telephone adapted for regular telephone calls VoIP calls and the like. The agent device may also include a computer for communicating with one or more servers of the contact center and performing data processing associated with contact center operations and for interfacing with customers via voice and other multimedia communication mechanisms.

The contact center may also include a reporting server configured to generate reports from data aggregated by the statistics server . Such reports may include near real time reports or historical reports concerning the state of resources such as for example average waiting time abandonment rate agent occupancy and the like. The reports may be generated automatically or in response to specific requests from a requestor e.g. agent administrator contact center application and or the like .

The contact center may also include a multimedia social media server for engaging in media interactions other than voice interactions with the end user devices and or web servers . The media interactions may be related for example to email vmail voice mail through email chat video text messaging web social media co browsing and the like. The web servers may include for example social interaction site hosts for a variety of known social interaction sites to which an end user may subscribe such as for example Facebook Twitter and the like. The web servers may also provide web pages for the enterprise that is being supported by the contact center. End users may browse the web pages and get information about the enterprise s products and services. The web pages may also provide a mechanism for contacting the contact center via for example web chat voice call email web real time communication WebRTC or the like.

According to one exemplary embodiment of the invention in addition to real time interactions deferrable also referred to as back office or offline interactions activities may also be routed to the contact center agents. Such deferrable activities may include for example responding to emails responding to letters attending training seminars or any other activity that does not entail real time communication with a customer. In this regard an iXn server interacts with the routing server for selecting an appropriate agent to handle the activity. Once assigned to an agent the activity may be pushed to the agent or may appear in the agent s workbin collectively referenced as as a task to be completed by the agent. The agent s workbin may be implemented via any data structure conventional in the art such as for example a linked list array and or the like. The workbin may be maintained for example in buffer memory of each agent device . According to one embodiment deferrable interactions may also be subject to CCIM.

According to one exemplary embodiment of the invention the mass storage device s may store one or more databases relating to agent data e.g. agent profiles schedules etc. customer data e.g. customer profiles interaction data e.g. details of each interaction with a customer including reason for the interaction disposition data time on hold handle time etc. and the like. According to one embodiment some of the data e.g. customer profile data may be maintained in a customer relations management CRM database hosted in the mass storage device or elsewhere. The mass storage device may take form of a hard disk or disk array as is conventional in the art.

The contact center may also include a reporting server configured to generate reports from data aggregated by the statistics server . Such reports may include near real time reports or historical reports concerning the state of resources such as for example average waiting time abandonment rate agent occupancy and the like. The reports may be generated automatically or in response to specific requests from a requestor e.g. agent administrator contact center application and or the like .

The various servers of may each include one or more processors executing computer program instructions and interacting with other system components for performing the various functionalities described herein. The computer program instructions are stored in a memory implemented using a standard memory device such as for example a random access memory RAM . The computer program instructions may also be stored in other non transitory computer readable media such as for example a CD ROM flash drive or the like. Also although the functionality of each of the servers is described as being provided by the particular server a person of skill in the art should recognize that the functionality of various servers may be combined or integrated into a single server or the functionality of a particular server may be distributed across one or more other servers without departing from the scope of the embodiments of the present invention. In addition the functionality the functionality of the CC iXn controller may be incorporated into one or more of the CC components or vice versa as will be apparent to a person of skill in the art.

In the various embodiments the term interaction is used generally to refer to any real time and non real time interaction that uses any communication channel including without limitation telephony calls PSTN or VoIP calls emails vmails voice mail through email video chat screen sharing text messages social media messages web real time communication e.g. WebRTC calls and the like.

The CC iXn controller may include a routing server which may be similar to the routing server of . The CC routing server is coupled to a CC statistics server and a CC telephony server which may be similar to the statistics server and call server of .

According to one embodiment the client iXn controller includes a client router and client iXn media controller . The client router may be configured as a lite version of the CC routing server and the client iXn media controller may be configured as a lite version of the CC telephony server . In this regard the client router and iXn media controller provide functionality similar to the basic functionality provided respectively by the CC routing server and telephony server

According to one embodiment the client iXn controller may be configured to monitor the presence of monitored agents e.g. agents in a customer s preferred agent list . This may be done for example by the client router requesting status of one or more of the monitored agents either periodically or on an as needed basis. The CC iXn controller receives the request and invokes the CC routing server to in turn query the statistics server for status information of the one or more agents. The agent status information for a particular agent may indicate for example whether the agent is available the communication medium for which the agent is agent and the like. The retrieved agent status information is forwarded to the client router over the communication network .

According to one embodiment the routing logic for routing interactions involving the customer resides in the client iXn controller. In this regard the client router and or iXn media controller communicates with the CC routing server to request that an interaction be routed to an agent or agent group as instructed by the customer s routing logic. Such agent may be selected automatically by the customer s routing logic based on for example agents that have been identified by the customer as being preferred and current availability of such agents. The routing request may include data of the requesting user e.g. a customer phone number and identification of the desired agent or agent group. The CC routing server then interacts with the CC telephony server to cause the interaction to be routed to the agent device of the selected agent.

The client iXn controller is equipped with a client router client SIP server and client statistics server which may be lite versions of respectively the routing server CC SIP server and the contact center CC statistics server .

According to one embodiment the client statistics server may be configured to exchange messages with a contact center presence server using SIMPLE SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions to detect presence of desired agents. According to one embodiment the contact center presence server may be in communication with or incorporated into the contact center statistics server to provide status of the identified agents. Once received the client statistics server may expose the agent status data to the client router for selecting an agent or agent group with which to communicate. The agent status data may also be provided for display by the CCIM application to allow a customer to manually select the agent with whom he wants to communicate.

According to one embodiment the client router invokes the client SIP server to exchange SIP messages with the CC SIP server to cause routing of an interaction from to the end user device to a particular agent or agent group. Data about the end user as well as the requested agent or agent group may be transmitted via the SIP messages. The CC SIP server then interacts with one or more CC components to cause the interaction to be routed to the agent device of the selected agent.

The client iXn controller is equipped with a client router client telephony server and client statistics server which may be lite versions of respectively the CC routing server CC telephony server and CC statistics server

According to one embodiment the client statistics server may be configured to request and receive agent status information from the CC statistics server using the proprietary protocol. In this regard the client statistics server subscribes to the CC statistics server to receive agent status information as would any other client located at the contact center e.g. the CC routing server . Once subscribed the client statistics server exposes the agent status data to its subscribing clients such as for example the client telephony server and client router

According to one embodiment the client telephony server invokes the client router to exchange messages with the CC routing server to cause routing of an interaction to a particular agent or agent group. Data about the end user as well as the requested agent or agent group may be transmitted via the proprietary protocol. The contact center telephony server then allows the end user device to establish connection with the available agent device.

According to one embodiment the client iXn controller is also equipped with a federation proxy for transmitting interaction routing requests to the CC iXn controller . The client iXn controller may further include an iXn media controller client router and client statistics server which may be lite versions of respectively the CC telephony server routing server and CC statistics server

According to one embodiment the client statistics server may be configured to request and receive agent status information from the CC statistics server after the customer has been authenticated by the CC federation proxy . In this regard the client statistics server subscribes to the CC statistics server to receive agent status information as would any other client located at the contact center e.g. the CC telephony server . Once subscribed the client statistics server exposes the agent status data to its subscribing clients such as for example the iXn media controller and client router

According to one embodiment the iXn media controller invokes the client router to transmit requests to cause routing of an interaction to a particular agent or agent group. Data about the end user as well as the requested agent or agent group may be transmitted in the request. According to one embodiment the request is forwarded to the CC iXn controller via the client federation proxy .

As a person of skill in the art should appreciate for interactions other than voice interactions the telephony SIP servers at the customer and client side are replaced with a CC or client interaction server similar to the interaction server of which is configured to process non voice interactions.

According to one embodiment determination as to whether an unresolved interaction exists is performed by searching the mass storage device for interaction records stored for the customer that have been identified as being unresolved. Such records may further indicate the routing strategy that was invoked and the portion of the routing strategy that was executed when the interaction was left uncompleted. The application may be configured to resume the interaction from this point on. For example a next step in the routing strategy may be to select an agent with the right skills to handle the interaction.

The resumed interaction may utilize the same or different communication channels that were used during the last interaction. For example the customer may have started a flight booking process on the web page of the business when the interaction was discontinued. The customer may be able to resume the interaction by invoking the application and placing a call to his preferred agent. Of course the application may be configured to inquire whether the customer wants to resume this interaction before doing so.

If there are no unresolved interactions to be resumed the application waits and detects a condition to initiate an interaction to an identified agent or agent group. The condition may be for example receipt of a customer command to initiate the interaction. For example the application may provide a graphical user interface with availability presence information of preferred agents and or agent groups along with an option to call email or chat with such agents. Selection of one of the interaction options initiates the corresponding interaction with the identified agent or agent group. The presence information may indicate whether the agent is busy with another interaction not scheduled for work and or the like. According to one embodiment the list of preferred agents and agent groups is configurable and modifiable by the customer at any time. For example the graphical user interface may provide options to add delete or modify agents or agent groups from the customer s preferred list.

In one embodiment detecting a particular event may automatically trigger the interaction or display a question to the user as to whether he wants to initiate the interaction. The events may be for example detecting a particular time e.g. if the user has set a timer to initiate the interaction or detecting a monitored condition e.g. if charge on a credit card was above a preset amount . In another example even if the user manually indicates that he wants to initiate the interaction the application may detect a conflict and either block the call or display the conflict and ask the user to confirm that he wants to proceed with the interaction. For example the application may have access to a preconfigured rule e.g. set by the customer that no calls are to be initiated when the customer is driving e.g. when the bluetooth device in the car is active . In another example the application may have access to the customer s calendar and detect that the customer is scheduled to have a meeting that would overlap with the interaction.

For purposes of describing the embodiment of it is assumed that the customer has selected a telephony interaction by selecting the call option and no conflicts have been detected to allow the interaction. According to one embodiment although a specific agent or agent group is listed next to the call option the number that is called may be a general telephone number of the contact center.

In another embodiment the customer simply transmits a call command and the routing logic at the customer end selects an agent according to for example preference settings user ratings and the like.

According to one embodiment if the customer selects an agent whose status information indicates that he is not available to handle the call the application may respond by asking the customer if he or she wants to try connecting anyway or whether he or she wants to try later when the agent s presence status indicates that he is available. If the customer indicates that he or she wants to try later the application may be configured to monitor the identified agent s presence information and once the agent is indicated to be present automatically launch the interaction with the identified agent. Of course a prompt may be displayed to the customer to confirm that the interaction is still desired. For example the prompt may say Agent X is now available please click to connect. Prior to sending the prompt the contact center system may reserve the agent for a configurable short time e.g. 5 seconds to allow the customer to react. If that agent is desired by more than one customer the first customer who reacts e.g. clicks to connect gets the connection to the agent. Once the connection is established a negative alert may be sent by the contact center system to the other customers indicating that the agent is no longer available and asking if they want to be notified again. According to one embodiment the customers who originally got the positive alert of the agent availability get the negative alert if the connection cannot be established for those customers despite their clicking to connect.

If the call is to proceed despite the agent being unavailable the client iXn controller transmits an agent reservation request in act to the CC iXn controller to reserve the selected agent or agent group. According to one embodiment the request is transmitted to the CC iXn controller over the data channel prior to or concurrently with the transmitting of call data. According to one embodiment the reservation request is received at a central place at the contact center where logic for agent reservation resides such as for example at a CC telephony server . If the reservation request identifies an agent group or a list with various possible agents the CC telephony server may be configured to select e.g. randomly one of the various agents of the group or list for reservation.

Once an agent is reserved for the particular interaction the agent is blocked for any other interactions for a particular period of time e.g. 15 seconds . For example the agent may be identified by the statistics server as being in a busy unavailable state. It is possible that multiple agent reservation requests for the same agent may be concurrently received from multiple routing servers e.g. client routers or CC routing servers . In this case priority data associated with the requests may be used for determining to whom to assign the agent. Priority determinations may be made based on for example customer segmentation information about the customer associated with the interaction. According to this example requests relating to Gold customers may be given higher priority than requests relating to Bronze customers.

In act a determination is made as to whether the agent reservation was successful. If the answer is NO another agent reservation request is transmitted to either the same agent or agent group or to a new agent or agent group. In this regard the routing logic at the client router determines whether to retry the same agent agent group or select a next preferred agent or agent group. Identification of the next preferred agent or agent group may be pre configured by the customer. The customer may also manually select a different agent or agent group in response to indication of the unsuccessful agent reservation request. Of course instead of the agent selecting a specific agent freedom may be given to the enterprise to select an available agent as would be done according to conventional routing mechanisms.

If an agent was successfully reserved the client iXn controller in act transmits a call control message to the CC iXn controller over the data channel. According to one embodiment the telephony server coupled to the switch media gateway that receives the voice call via the voice channel receives the call control message via the data channel. The call control message may contain for example data about the interaction customer and or reserved agent. According to one embodiment the client iXn controller further provides a dialer application for launching the actual voice call towards the contact center. In this regard the dialer application functions as a switch for the end user device.

Once launched the voice call lands on the switch media gateway at the contact center until routed to an appropriate destination. As described in further detail in when the call arrives at the switch media gateway the CC telephony server determines a routing point also referred to an external route point to which the call should be transferred based on the received interaction data. According to one embodiment the identified routing point is a personal routing point that is enabled for CCIM.

In act the client iXn controller e.g. client telephony server receives a call transfer message from the CC iXn controller that identifies the transfer routing point along with any interaction data collected by the CC iXn controller. By forwarding the collected interaction data from the CC iXn controller to the client iXn controller data such as identification of the reserved agent is preserved.

According to one embodiment the transfer routing point is associated with the client telephony server hosted by the client iXn controller . The call transfer message is received by the client telephony server over the data channel. The actual call is also received by the dialer application that acts as the switch for the end user device. In response to the call arriving at the dialer application the client telephony server informs the client router of the call.

In act the client router proceeds to route the call according to its routing logic. In this regard the routing logic may be configured to identify the preferred agent that has been reserved for the interaction e.g. based on the received interaction data and proceed to route the call to the reserved agent. The routing logic may optionally check whether the reserved agent is indeed still available. In routing the call the client router invokes the dialer application to call the access directory number of the reserved agent. The access number may be provided in the call transfer message from the CC iXn controller transmitted in act . A voice connection is then made with the customer and the reserved agent.

In act the CC telephony server identifies an external route point based on the received interaction data. For example the CC telephony server may identify the caller number in the interaction data as one that is enabled for CCIM. A personal route point is thus identified and reserved for routing the call. The interaction data received from the client iXn controller is then saved in association with the personal route point. According to one embodiment the personal route point is associated with a directory number of the dialer application hosted by the client iXn controller .

In act the actual voice call launched by the end user device is received at the switch media gateway and the call is matched to the data saved in association with the personal route point.

In act the CC telephony server transfers the call to the personal route point. The transfer of the call further causes transfer of the interaction data to the client telephony server . According to one embodiment transfer of the call to the client telephony server relinquishes control of the call by the contact center. Thus further routing of the call to the reserved agent is performed based on routing logic controlled by the customer instead of routing logic under the control of the contact center.

Although routing is used herein as a main example of interaction processing by the customer a person of skill in the art should recognize that the customer may be in control of other aspects of interaction processing such as for example obtaining interaction history data checking status of interactions and the like. Also although the examples of customer controlled interactions provided herein relate to inbound real time interactions initiated by the customer e.g. voice calls chat directly routed emails etc. a person of skill in the art should recognize that deferrable interactions could also be controlled by the customer such as for example emails that are placed in the agent s workbin for handling as time permits. Outbound interactions initiated by the contact center may also be controlled by the customer such as for example by enabling the customer to control the customer s entries in calling lists by removing the customers number changing the time of the outbound contact selecting a telephone number assigning the outbound interaction to certain agents and the like.

In addition to embodiments where control of the interaction is by the customer a hybrid solution is also contemplated where certain parts of the interaction processing are controlled by the customer and other parts are controlled by the business. For example certain internal processes for claim approval will stay under business control while the customer may control the claim adjuster who ultimately handles the claim.

In another embodiment a soft CCIM may be provided to a customer where the customer merely expresses interaction intent and preferred agent s but the actual final assignment of the interaction to an agent is done by the business that tries to accommodate the customer s preference.

According to one embodiment a customer may share personal ranking recommendation and or satisfaction information collectively referred to as rating about agents services and or products with other users. The agent ratings may be indicative of qualifications of the agents customer satisfaction provided by the agents and or the like. According to one embodiment the VMR module may be invoked to collect and share the rating information on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter. The information may also be shared on rating websites such as Yelp. According to one embodiment the CCIM application provides a graphical user interface to prompt a user to rate an agent e.g. after an interaction with such agent .

According to one embodiment the client CC iXn controller and or VRM module may be configured to automatically monitor websites on the Internet for ratings of agents of a particular contact center that are posted by other customers. For example ratings may be obtained for all agents listed in the customer s preferred agent list and an average of such ratings may be displayed by the CCIM application along with any personal rating provided by the customer. The collected ratings for an agent may be used to propose the agent to a preferred status or demote the agent to a less preferred status. The rating information may also be used to select an agent to whom to route an interaction enabled for CCIM if no manual selection was made by the customer.

According to one embodiment the exposing of agent rating information in addition to agent presence information allows the customer to have a more complete set of data for deciding when and with which agent to have a CCIM enabled interaction. For example if a first agent with a low rating is identified as being available for a voice interaction but a second agent with a higher rating is identified as being busy for such voice interaction the customer may want to wait until agent two becomes available prior to initiating the call.

Agent rating and presence information may also be used for non CCIM enabled interactions. are exemplary signaling diagrams of messages exchanged between an end user and the contact center system in a non CCIM enabled interaction according to one embodiment of the invention. According to the embodiment of the end user device may host an application that allows interaction with the contact center system to gather information about agents products and services of the contact center.

In act the end user device invokes the application and submits a message to the contact center system indicating that the customer has a problem that needs to be solved. For example the customer may select an I have a problem button displayed by the application.

In act the contact center system e.g. multimedia social media server receives the data and in response transmits a second message to the application for gathering information on the cause of the problem. For example the customer may be prompted to enter the name of the product to which the problem is related. In another embodiment the history of interactions with the application may provide clue as to the product or service that is causing problems for the customer.

In act the application transmits details on the problem such as for example the product name. In the example of the customer identifies that the problem is product related and the product name is Vacuum . 

In response to identifying the product causing problems the contact center system may be configured in act to retrieve product metadata including for example available services relating to the product agent skills required to deal with issues with the product and the like. Such information may be retrieved for example from the mass storage device located at the contact center system .

Based on the retrieved product metadata suggestions are provided to the customer in act as to how to resolve the issue. The options may include self help options as well as interaction options with live agents that have been identified as having skills for handling the interaction. According to one embodiment the contact center system exposes agent presence information to the application for each type of interaction channel. In the example of agent and agent have skills to have a chat about the identified product issue while agent has skills to conduct a voice conversation about the identified product issue. Agent is identified as being available for chat while agent is busy. Agent is identified as being busy for voice interactions.

According to one embodiment in response to identification of agents with skills for handling the particular issue the application at the end user device may be configured to search in act one or more social networks for ratings by other people on the product and or agents identified by the contact center system . For example the application may be configured to go inquire social networks like Facebook to see is any of the customer s friends have provided a rating for the product or agents e.g. a total number of likes or dislikes for a particular agent . If such information is available the agent rating information is returned to the application in act for display to the customer. Embodiments of the present invention thus provide the customer full information as to agent availability as well as agent ratings for helping the customer decide how he wants to interact with the contact center.

According to one embodiment the customer may configure the application to automatically select the agent with the highest rating if the agent is available. If the highest rated agent is not available the application may be configured to prompt the customer to indicate how he would like to proceed. For example the customer may want to proceed with a lower rated agent that is currently available wait for the higher rated agent or the like.

In the example of the end user device transmits in act a message to the contact center system indicating that the customer will wait for agent . In response the contact center system e.g. call server creates a virtual interaction in act where the target of the interaction is set to agent . The contact center system further transmits a message in act that the customer will be notified when agent becomes available.

When agent does become available the contact center system reserves agent in act and pushes notification to the customer in act as to this fact. The customer is also provided information on the choices that he can take such as receiving the number of agent requesting that agent call the customer at his number or requesting additional time before engaging in the interaction with agent .

If the customer needs additional time the contact center system releases agent re reserves him and inquires the customer as to whether he wants to engage in the interaction collectively referenced as acts and until the customer indicates in act that he wants the access telephone number of agent to initiate the interaction. In response the contact center system allocates the number and associates it to the customer.

In acts referred generally as the customer dials the telephone number for agent and the contact center system matches the incoming call to the stored customer data and routes the call to an agent device for agent .

Once the call between the customer and the agent terminates the contact center system may transmit a survey to get feedback on the experience. The customer may respond or decline the survey. Even if the customer declines he or she may be willing to share his experience with his friends. In this regard the application or VRM module may provide a graphical user interface to allow the customer to capture information about the experience. Such information may include for example a rating given to the agent based on the experience. The information is stored in the customer s mass storage device but may be exposed in act to one or more businesses social media networks and the like based on settings configured by the customer. For example the VRM module may access APIs exposed by various social networks to automatically post the experience information on those networks.

Although the interaction in are described as non CCIM enabled interaction a person of skill in the art should recognize that the interaction may also be a CCIM enabled interaction where the routing logic that is executed to route the interaction is controlled by the customer instead of the contact center. In this regard when the ratings of the first and second agents are received in act the CCIM application may be configured to either automatically or in response to a user command request an interaction specifying the higher rated agent employing a process similar to the process described with respect to .
