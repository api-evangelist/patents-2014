This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 847 008 filed on Jul. 16 2013 with the same title by the same inventors which provisional application is hereby incorporated by reference herein.

The present invention is directed generally to an expert network and more particularly to an expert network that matches experts with those that need these experts.

Expert networks are emerging as a means for spreading information and helping knowledge seekers find specialized expertise in various fields. Expert networks are usually privately owned closed or limited access networks aggregating the expertise of numerous individuals on a contract basis. Traditional operators of expert network marketplaces bring experts together into one single unified marketplace typically often through a manual process or limited automation. Existing expert networks marketplaces lack the ability to transform themselves into taggable entities that can themselves be attributed with characteristics.

The present invention is therefore directed to the problem of developing an expert network with taggable entities that can be attributed with characteristics thereby enabling the respective marketplaces to be linked together in real time through a system wide operator.

An Expert Calling Network ECN provides a substantial improvement over the traditional means by which an expert network may be organized monetized or operated. Each ECN is itself an independent network of experts and consumers but depending on the preferences of the Network Sponsor may be linked with other ECNs and therefore serve as a single node on a multi nodal or meta network. In one embodiment of the present invention a software service is provided that enables any qualified individual organization institution or other entity to create and populate an ECN and then to monetize transactions successfully completed through use of the software system. The service provided by the present invention reduces many of the technology and business barriers to entry for entities to rapidly assemble and deploy an expert network.

The present invention provides an electronic communication system to enable one or multiple parties to aggregate one or multiple experts under one or multiple brand identities and to make each unique identity publicly or privately accessible to other entities seeking to access the aggregate experts on a per use or paid basis.

Dozens of organizations operate private expert networks and deploy closed loop systems to facilitate the flow of knowledge from experts to consumers. The present invention provides entities with innovative tools that offer numerous advantages over traditional methods for operating an expert network.

A traditional expert network is managed by a single entity and may use manual or automated processes to bridge communication between users consumers and experts . The entity operating a traditional expert network acts in isolation and is itself devoid of any tagged or recorded characteristics or properties which would enable it or its users to interact with other expert networks or their users. This creates transaction barriers and knowledge flow barriers as each entity and its users operate on an island without the ability to seamlessly interact with others.

In a multi nodal Expert Calling Network ECN of the present invention the characteristics of each entity operating an ECN can be tagged and recorded in a database. The configurable preferences of each ECN entity operator and its users can also be tagged and recorded as additional entity characteristics for that particular ECN.

Thus a multi nodal Expert Calling Network not only automates the interaction between consumers and experts within each ECN entity it also creates a multi nodal meta network which enables both the ECN entities themselves and their users to be seamlessly integrated with other ECN entities and users based on the preferences set by each individual ECN entity operator or the policies of a system wide ECN operator.

The invention includes a multi nodal System A for registering storing data and bridging communications for Sponsors B of an Expert Calling Network Sponsors can be organizations or individuals or other entities the Experts C within their network and the Consumers D or seekers of expert knowledge. See .

As seen in in step a Consumer searches for an Expert that Consumer may find through a Sponsored Network s advertising or other outreach and promotion. In step the Consumer identifies the expert. In step the Consumer completes a qualification process and upon successful completion in step can reserve the time of an available Expert. In step the System notifies the Expert through various means of the live request and in step bridges the Consumer and the Expert. In step if the communication link is dropped the system handles the error by reestablishing the link or substituting the type of link. In step the communication session is completed and in step the session is archived with a digital recording of the session for later use. If the communication link is not broken for the duration of the reserved time then in step the transaction is settled.

Each Sponsor and its Expert may be a unique node in the network designated as an ECN but one skilled in the art will recognize that an Expert could belong to one or many Sponsored ECNs. One skilled in the art will recognize that Experts could self sponsor and self provision their participation in a closed or open network or no network and not require a third party ECN Sponsor to make use of the System.

The system tracks authorizations and may track digital rights of the respective Sponsors Experts Consumers. System behavior may follow rules set according to the rights management.

Each ECN displays a directory of Experts and each Expert may have associated properties or be assigned specific static or dynamic characteristics. A static characteristic might include historical biographical data about an Expert while a dynamic characteristic of the Expert might include the level of demand within a specified time frame or demand in real time. These characteristics are tagged in the database record for the Expert so they can be searched via these characteristics.

Experts may have self designated Sponsor designated or System designated properties which are stored in the System. The directory data may be visual or be searchable by keyword or other data fields. The System may utilize the characteristics of any individual Expert to advertise the Expert s availability through other third party systems e.g. The AdWords system of Google or itself may advertise or highlight expert availability.

Consumers may have associated properties or characteristics that are captured by and stored in the System. For example a Consumer TYPE characteristic might indicate the Consumer is a private sector entity non profit entity or government entity. The Consumer LOCATION characteristic might indicate the zip code or census tract in which the Consumer is located. Many other variable and features can be used as tags or characteristics as would be apparent upon review of this.

The System may utilize intelligent matching to connect or recommend relevant parties with matching characteristics or perform other forms of advanced matching.

Experts or Sponsors may set limitations on access to Experts by Consumer characteristics. The System Operator Sponsors and Experts may set variable pricing depending on Consumer characteristics.

In one example a natural disaster such as Hurricane Katrina in the Gulf Coast or Hurricane Sandy on the East coast may result in a large number of Experts setting their hourly rate at zero free but only when their time or expertise is requested by Consumers with ENTITY characteristics that both indicate the Consumer seeking knowledge is a non profit or government agency and that the Consumer LOCATION characteristic also indicates the Consumer is located in one of the areas affected by the natural disaster.

The System is able to over ride the policies and preferences of Sponsoring organizations to rapidly assemble Experts with characteristics matching specific areas of interest. For example if an act of terrorism were threatened against individuals operating in a specific domain e.g. a nuclear power plant in the Northeastern region of the United States the System could rapidly assemble Experts with matching characteristics in relevant knowledge domains e.g. radiation exposure nuclear plant operations and make them available to Consumers seeking such knowledge on an emergency basis. Such use of the System could be accessible to various agencies branches or departments of government e.g. Homeland Security the military Defense etc. .

Sponsors may set ECN specific preferences such that their Experts are proprietary and unavailable to Consumers outside the Sponsor s ECN and communication interface to Consumers. Other Sponsors may set their ECN preferences to open their Experts so they are accessible in the Networks of other Sponsors.

The System may enable financial transactions between Sponsors of each node in the network or each ECN such that if an Expert belonging to one Sponsor s ECN is accessed through another ECN a transaction and revenue share arrangement between the ECN Network Sponsors is made possible.

The System may integrate with other third party applications or systems such that Consumers may transact on the System to request to communicate with an expert via a click through on a web browser or via any HTTP enabled device to interact with the system.

The System may create availability for a grouping of experts based on Consumer demand or any other criteria such as Expert characteristics. Pricing to bridge such a call may be based on the cumulative cost all the Experts or any other pricing criteria.

The System may offer pre set groupings of Experts or dynamically aggregate a Grouping of Experts on the fly based on requests by the Consumer for specific Expert characteristics.

Consumers that select to communicate with an expert may be pre authorized to conduct such a transaction or authorized to conduct transactions after submitting valid credit card information or other payment information.

Transactions between Consumers and Experts may be tied to a Consumer credit card account tied credit coupons or invoiced upon completion of any transaction. One skilled in the art will recognize that any number of payment and invoicing approaches may be tied to the authorization and settlement of any transaction.

The System may bridge communications between users via asynchronous messaging email and or a live communications session via a telephony connection or video based service or other communication system.

Experts participating in an ECN may be paid for offering their advice via the ECN. The rate for the Expert may be self determined or may vary based on various demand metrics. For example if an Expert is in high demand his her rate could escalate according to certain rules. Rates and commissions may both be static or variable.

Experts may be reserved for specific time allotments contracted at the time a request is initiated e.g. 15 min 60 min 90 min or open ended and charged in any time unit interval e.g. 1 minute . Other time segments may be employed without departing from the present invention.

The System will bridge the Consumer s and Expert s to prevent the private contact information of each party from being shared with the other party

The System may allow Consumer s to rate satisfaction for the Experts and may allow Experts to rate Consumers along any number of criteria.

Various qualification criteria may be used to determine Consumer s ability to participate in the ECN through which they entered the System or any other ECN enabled by the System.

Time availability of expert can be pre set or made available via auction mechanism or intelligent agents and can vary in real time based on dynamic metrics. Scheduling between participants may be integrated with third party tools e.g. Google calendars Apple ICS etc. or coordinated directly by participants or coordinated outside the system via a concierge system.

The system contemplates a fuse based system in which bridging of communication is open but completed within a predetermined or definable number of hours or days of the initial request.

The system may utilize any number of automatic notifications via system interfaces email text audio recorded messages prior to bridging a connection. System may also utilize a queuing system with one touch advancement to cycle through queue. Calls may also be bridged via manual intervention by a human that bridges two or more parties.

Electronic communications systems are not entirely reliable therefore the system may deploy multiple methods for handling dropped communications prior to end of a designated communication call between participants.

For example if the communication link is between just one Consumer and just one Expert the system will recognize which party dropped and may respond differently.

If a Consumer drops the communications call the Expert may be given prompts to terminate the communications call or re initiate the system bridging to the Consumer.

If an Expert drops the communications call and the Consumer holds the line then System may work to re initiate the system to bridge to the Expert. If Expert is not available communication call billing may be reset as if the partial communications call never took place.

If an Expert drops communications link call and Consumer subsequently drops the communications link call within a designate time interval the communication may terminate and the parties are billed paid appropriately. One skilled in the art will recognize there may be other modes for handling dropped calls.

Settlement of transaction can take place via a credit card account tied credit coupon or other means. The System has mechanisms for reporting administrative tools and tools for account management.

Compensation fees commissions other types can be variable and distinct to all System participants. In general the System deploys an intermediated revenue model.

According to one aspect of the present invention an apparatus for matching bridging and settling a call transaction between one or more tagged consumers with one or more tagged experts includes one or more databases a server computer or processor coupled to the databases and software. Each set of consumers and experts exist within a network node or ECN managed by an ECN operator entity. The one or more databases store consumer records expert records and ECN entity records. Each of the expert and ECN entity records includes a tag with one or more searchable characteristics in the profile. The databases are accessible via a logical and presentation layer of an HTTP compatible device such as a mobile phone computer or the like. The software is stored in the form of non transitory computer readable media which has stored thereon instructions causing the processor to establish various logical functions or layers. For example a business logic layer ensures that only authorized consumers may enter requests that can be matched to searchable characteristics of each expert. The business logic layer may also ensure that the preferences of ECN operator entity are implemented according to instruction and system wide policies. Another business logic layer permits matched participants to schedule or manually initiate a time to be bridged on a telephone call or other connection such as a video connection or other multimedia connection. An interactive voice response layer and call bridging layer bridges consumers and experts via a telephony connection. Alternatively a cloud application programming interface layer bridges consumers and experts via a telephony connection. Yet another business logic layer reconnects each party if a call is dropped prior to completion. A user interface layer enables consumers or experts to create a personal profile and tag such profile with one or more searchable characteristics. A user interface layer enables ECN operators to create an ECN entity profile and tag such profile with preferences or searchable characteristics. An application programming interface integration layer tags experts or consumer profiles with characteristics designated by an external application such as a web based application. A user interface layer prevents consumer and experts from having direct contact information for each other. An automated billing settlement and disbursement layer ensure each party is billed or paid on each transaction. Each of the aforementioned layers can be implemented in software that is stored on a non transitory computer readable media which is then executed by a server or other processor.

One possible implementation of the one or more databases includes one or more an SQL servers each with an application layer that may be implemented on the .NET framework. Call scheduling may not be pre determined but instead bridged when initiated by an expert within a pre determined window of time after which a pending call request shall expire. The telephony connection may be a video connection a voice connection or multimedia connection. Matching may be conducted by experts and consumers within a single ECN or from a plurality of ECN nodes in the system. The preferences of each individual user ECN operator and the policies of the system wide operator will determine if and when the users from each individual ECN are exposed in part or in full to the users of other ECNs.

Another exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes an apparatus for tagging one or multiple ECN operating entities with characteristics including ECN entity preferences thus enabling matching bridging and settling of call transactions between tagged consumers and tagged experts included within separate ECN entities.
