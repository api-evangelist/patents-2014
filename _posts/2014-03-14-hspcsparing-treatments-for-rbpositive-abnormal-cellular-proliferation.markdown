This invention is in the area of improved compounds for and methods of treating selected RB positive cancers and other Rb positive abnormal cellular proliferative disorders while minimizing the deleterious effects on healthy cells for example healthy Hematopoietic Stem Cells and Progenitor Cells HSPCs associated with current treatment modalities. In one aspect improved treatment of select RB positive cancers is disclosed using specific compounds disclosed herein. In certain embodiments the compounds described herein act as highly selective and in certain embodiments short transiently acting cyclin dependent kinase 4 6 CDK 4 6 inhibitors when administered to subjects.

The regulation of the cell cycle is governed and controlled by specific proteins which are activated and deactivated mainly through phosphorylation dephosphorylation processes in a precisely timed manner. The key proteins that coordinate the initiation progression and completion of cell cycle program are cyclin dependent kinases CDKs . Cyclin dependent kinases belong to the serine threonine protein kinase family. They are heterodimeric complexes composed of a catalytic kinase subunit and a regulatory cyclin subunit. CDK activity is controlled by association with their corresponding regulatory subunits cyclins and CDK inhibitor proteins Cip Kip proteins INK4s by their phosphorylation state and by ubiquitin mediated proteolytic degradation see D. G. Johnson C. L. Walker Annu Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol 39 1999 295 312 D. O. Morgan Annu Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 13 1997 261 291 C. J. Sherr Science 274 1996 1672 1677 T. Shimamura et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 16 2006 3751 3754 .

There are four CDKs that are significantly involved in cellular proliferation CDK1 which predominantly regulates the transition from G2 to M phase and CDK2 CDK4 and CDK6 which regulate the transition from G1 to S phase Malumbres M Barbacid M. Cell cycle CDKs and cancer a changing paradigm. Nat. Rev. Cancer 2009 9 3 153 166 . In early to mid G1 phase when the cell is responsive to mitogenic stimuli activation of CDK4 cyclin D and CDK6 cyclin D induces phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein pRb . Phosphorylation of pRb releases the transcription factor E2F which enters the nucleus to activate transcription of other cyclins which promote further progression of the cell cycle see J. A. Diehl Cancer Biol. Ther. 1 2002 226 231 C. J. Sherr Cell 73 1993 1059 1065 . CDK4 and CDK6 are closely related proteins with basically indistinguishable biochemical properties see M. Malumbres M. Barbacid Trends Biochem. Sci. 30 2005 630 641 .

A number of CDK 4 6 inhibitors have been identified including specific pyrido 2 3 d pyrimidines 2 anilinopyrimidines diaryl ureas benzoyl 2 4 diaminothiazoles indolo 6 7 a pyrrolo 3 4 c carbazoles and oxindoles see P. S. Sharma R. Sharma R. Tyagi Curr. Cancer Drug Targets 8 2008 53 75 . For example WO 03 062236 identifies a series of 2 pyridin 2 ylamino pyrido 2 3 pyrimidin 7 ones for the treatment of Rb positive cancers that show selectivity for CDK4 6 including 6 acetyl 8 cyclopentyl 5 methyl 2 5 piperazin 1 yl pyridin 2 ylammino 8H pyrido 2 3 d pyrimidin 7 one PD0332991 which is currently being tested by Pfizer in late stage clinical trials as an anti neoplastic agent against estrogen positive HER2 negative breast cancer. VanderWel et al. describe an iodine containing pyrido 2 3 d pyrimidine 7 one CKIA as a potent and selective CDK4 inhibitor see VanderWel et al. J. Med. Chem. 48 2005 2371 2387 . WO 99 15500 filed by Glaxo Group Ltd discloses protein kinase and serine threonine kinase inhibitors. WO 2010 020675 filed by Novartis AG describes pyrrolopyrimidine compounds as CDK inhibitors. WO 2011 101409 also filed by Novartis describes pyrrolopyrimidines with CDK 4 6 inhibitory activity. WO 2005 052147 filed by Novartis and WO 2006 074985 filed by Janssen Pharma disclose additional CDK4 inhibitors. WO 2012 061156 filed by Tavares and assigned to G1 Therapeutics describes CDK inhibitors. WO 2013 148748 filed by Francis Tavares and assigned to G1 Therapeutics describes Lactam Kinase Inhibitors.

While selective CDK4 6 inhibitors are generally designed to target CDK4 6 replication dependent cancers the very fact that they inhibit CDK4 6 activity may also result in deleterious effects to CDK4 6 dependent healthy cells for example their growth inhibition. CDK4 6 activity is necessary for the production of healthy blood cells by the bone marrow as healthy hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells HSPCs require the activity of CDK4 6 for proliferation see Roberts et al. Multiple Roles of Cyclin Dependent Kinase 4 6 Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. JNCI 2012 104 6 476 487 . Healthy hematopoietic stem cells give rise to progenitor cells which in turn give rise to all the differentiated components of blood as shown in e.g. lymphocytes erythrocytes platelets granulocytes monocytes . Healthy hematopoietic cells display a gradient dependency on CDK4 6 activity for proliferation during myeloid erythroid differentiation see Johnson et al. Mitigation of hematological radiation toxicity in mice through pharmacological quiescence induced by CDK4 6 inhibition. J Clin. Invest. 2010 120 7 2528 2536 . Accordingly the least differentiated cells e.g. healthy hematopoietic stem cells HSCs multi potent progenitors MPPs and common myeloid progenitors CMP appear to be the most dependent on CDK4 6 activity for proliferation and therefore the most deleteriously affected by the use of a CDK4 6 inhibitor to treat a CDK4 6 replication dependent cancer or other proliferative disorder.

Accordingly there is an ongoing need for improved compounds methods and regimes to treat patients with select Rb positive cancers and abnormal cellular proliferative disorders while minimizing the treatment s effect on healthy cells such as HSPCs.

In one embodiment the subject is suffering from a Rb positive abnormal cellular proliferation disorder. In one embodiment the Rb positive abnormal cellular proliferation disorder is non cancerous.

In certain embodiments a compound described herein when used to treat a select Rb positive cellular proliferation disorder such as a cancer allows for a rapid reentry of healthy cells into the normal cell cycle and a fast reconstitution of damaged tissue and progeny cells such as hematological cells. In this aspect the compounds described herein when used to treat Rb positive cancers eliminate reduce and or minimize the drug holidays and dose delays associated with the current anti neoplastic use of CDK4 6 inhibitors allowing for the quick recovery of damaged blood cells through the replication and differentiation of progenitor and parent cells. Specifically the invention includes administering to a patient having a cancer such as an Rb positive cancer an effective amount of a compound described herein wherein the compound has a pharmacokinetic and enzymatic half life that provides for a transient reversible G1 arrest of CDK4 6 replication dependent cells. The compound can be any of those described in this application. Non limiting examples of active compounds are described in Table 1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition salt isotopic analog or prodrug thereof as provided below.

In one embodiment a compound described herein may be useful in an improved method for treating a cancer such as an Rb positive cancer wherein such methods have reduced or minimized effects on CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells due in part because they i utilize compounds that exhibit a pharmacokinetic and enzymatic half life which provide for a relatively short transient and reversible G1 arresting effect on CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells and ii allow for a rapid reentry into the cell cycle for the healthy cells following the cessation of administration or dissipation of therapeutically effective levels in the subject. Using a compound described herein allows for for example a reduction in the replication delay of the HSPCs due to CDK4 6 inhibition and or accelerated hematopoietic cell lineage recovery following cessation of CDK4 6 inhibitory activity and or reduced hematological deficiency because the utilized compound is short acting and reduces the length of off cycle periods or drug holidays associated with current CDK4 6 inhibitor treatment modalities which reduces or minimizes the facilitation of tumor drug resistance. In certain embodiments the use of a compound described herein allows for the continuous treatment of the subject over a longer time period without the need for an off cycle or drug holiday.

The timely resumption of CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cell proliferation is necessary for tissue repair and an overly long period of healthy cell cell cycle arrest for example HSPC cell cycle arrest is undesirable. Despite reports indicating that the selective CDK4 6 inhibitor PD0332991 is an effective inhibitor of Rb positive breast cancers it has been discovered that such inhibitor may not be the most ideal compound for use as a chemotherapeutic due to the excessive myelosuppressive effects of the compound. For example PD0332991 has a relatively long acting intra cellular effect see Roberts et al. Multiple Roles of Cyclin Dependent Kinase 4 6 Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. JCNI 2012 104 6 476 487 extending the transiency of G1 arrest of healthy cells such as HSPCs leading to dose limiting myelosuppression. Such a long acting effect delays for example the proliferation of HSPC cell lineages necessary to reconstitute the hematological cell lines that have been growth inhibited due to a treatment which may inhibit CDK4 6 activity and thus Rb phosphorylation in Rb competent cells. While desirable for its anti neoplastic effects the long acting G1 arrest provided by PD0332991 requires an extended off cycle period in order to reconstitute the erythroid platelet and myeloid cells monocyte and granulocyte adversely effected by acute HSPC G1 arrest in order to limit myelosuppressive and allow a hematologic replication period. The use of a compound described herein as anti neoplastic agent for the treatment of select Rb positive cancers may eliminate reduce or minimize the required length of off cycle periods or drug holidays allowing for a longer effective CDK4 6 inhibitory time period on the cancer over the course of an anti neoplastic regime.

Thus in one embodiment the invention includes administering a compound described herein including one selected from Table 1 in an effective amount to a host suffering from a Rb positive cancer in a treatment regime wherein either alone or in any combination thereof each of which is considered specifically and independently described i a substantial portion of the CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells e.g. at least 80 or greater for example HSPCs return to or approach pre treatment baseline cell cycle activity i.e. reenter the cell cycle in less than 24 hours 30 hours or 36 hours from the last administration of a compound described herein in humans ii a substantial portion of the CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells for example HSPCs reenter the cell cycle synchronously in less than 24 hours 30 hours or 36 hours from the last administration of a compound described herein iii the dissipation of the compound s inhibitory effect on CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells for example HSPCs occurs in less than 24 hours 30 hours or 36 hours from the administration of the compound iv a substantial portion of the CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells for example HSPCs return to or approach pre treatment baseline cell cycle activity i.e. reenter the cell cycle in less than 24 hours 30 hours or 36 hours from the dissipation of the compound s CDK4 6 inhibitory effect or vi a substantial portion of the CDK4 6 replicatin dependent healthy cells for example HSPCs return to or approach pre treatment baseline cell cycle activity i.e. reenter the cell cycle within less than about 24 hours about 30 hours or about 36 hours from the point in which the administered compound s concentration level in the subject s blood drops below a therapeutic effective concentration.

In a central embodiment of the invention a compound described herein can be administered in a concerted regimen with another agent such as a non DNA damaging targeted anti neoplastic agent or a hematopoietic growth factor agent for beneficial additive or synergistic effect against the abnormal cellular proliferation. It has been recently reported that the untimely administration of hematopoietic growth factors can have serious side effects. For example the use of the EPO family of growth factors has been associated with arterial hypertension cerebral convulsions hypertensive encephalopathy thromboembolism iron deficiency influenza like syndromes and venous thrombosis. The G CSF family of growth factors has been associated with spleen enlargement and rupture respiratory distress syndrome allergic reactions and sickle cell complications. By combining the administration of a compound described herein and methods of the present invention with the timely administration of hematopoietic growth factors for example at the time point wherein the affected cells are no longer under growth arrest it is possible for the health care practitioner to decrease the amount of the growth factor to minimize the unwanted adverse effects while achieving the desired therapeutic benefit. In one embodiment the growth factor is administered upon cessation of the effect of the inhibitory effect of the compound on the CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells for example HSPCs. Thus in this embodiment the use of a selective CDK4 6 inhibitor described herein in an anti neoplastic therapeutic regime may allow the subject to receive a reduced amount of growth factor because the targeted hematopoietic cells will have reentered the cell cycle quicker than when other CDK4 6 inhibitors for example PD0332991. In addition allowing rapid cell cycle reentry following G1 arrest by using a compound described herein provides for the ability to time the administration of hematopoietic growth factors to assist in the reconstitution of hematopoietic cell lines to maximize the growth factor effect. As such in one embodiment the use of a compound or method described herein is combined with the use of a hematopoietic growth factor including but not limited to granulocyte colony stimulating factor G CSF granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor GM CSF thrombopoietin interleukin IL 12 steel factor and erythropoietin EPO or a derivative thereof. In one embodiment the CDK4 6 inhibitor is administered prior to administration of the hematopoietic growth factor. In one embodiment the hematopoietic growth factor administration is timed so that the CDK4 6 inhibitor s effect on HSPCs has dissipated.

In one embodiment the use of a compound described herein is combined in a therapeutic regime with at least one other chemotherapeutic agent and can be one that does not rely on proliferation or advancement through the cell cycle for anti proliferative activity. Such agent may include but is not limited to tamoxifen midazolam letrozole bortezomib anastrozole goserelin an mTOR inhibitor a PI3 kinase inhibitors dual mTOR PI3K inhibitors MEK inhibitors RAS inhibitors ALK inhibitors HSP inhibitors for example HSP70 and HSP 90 inhibitors or a combination thereof . Examples of mTOR inhibitors include but are not limited to rapamycin and its analogs everolimus Afinitor temsirolimus ridaforolimus sirolimus and deforolimus. Examples of P13 kinase inhibitors include but are not limited to Wortmannin demethoxyviridin perifosine idelalisib PX 866 IPI 145 BAY 80 6946 BEZ235 RP6503 TGR 1202 RP5264 MLN1117 INK1117 Pictilisib Buparlisib SAR245408 XL147 SAR245409 XL765 Palomid 529 ZSTK474 PWT33597 RP6530 CUDC 907 and AEZS 136. Examples of MEK inhibitors include but are not limited to Tametinib Selumetinib MEK162 GDC 0973 XL518 and PD0325901. Examples of RAS inhibitors include but are not limited to Reolysin and siG12D LODER. Examples of ALK inhibitors include but are not limited to Crizotinib AP26113 and LDK378. HSP inhibitors include but are not limited to Geldanamycin or 17 N Allylamino 17 demethoxygeldanamycin 17AAG and Radicicol.

In certain embodiments a compound described herein is administered to the subject prior to treatment with another chemotherapeutic agent during treatment with another chemotherapeutic agent after administration of another chemotherapeutic agent or a combination thereof. In one embodiment a compound described herein is administered to the subject less than about 24 hours 20 hours 16 hours 12 hours 8 hours or 4 hours or less prior to treatment with the other chemotherapeutic agent in order to sensitize the Rb positive cancer to the chemotherapeutic agent. In one embodiment the compound is administered up to 4 hours prior to treatment with the other chemotherapeutic agent.

In one embodiment a compound described herein is administered in a manner that allows the drug facile access to the blood stream for example via intravenous injection or sublingual intraaortal or other efficient blood stream accessing route. In one embodiment a compound described herein is administered in an orally administrable formulation. In other embodiments a compound described herein is administered via topical transdermal or other desired administrative routes.

In one embodiment the G1 arresting effect dissipates such that the subject s CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells return to their pre administration baseline cell cycle activity within less than about 24 hours 30 hours 36 hours or 40 hours or within about 48 hours of the cessation of administration. In one embodiment the CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells are HSPCs. In one embodiment the use of a CDK4 6 inhibitor described herein results in the G1 arresting effect dissipating so that the subject s CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells return to or approach their pre administration baseline cell cycle activity within less than about 24 hours 30 hours 36 hours 40 hours or within less than about 48 hours from the point in which the CDK4 6 inhibitor s concentration level in the subject s blood drops below a therapeutic effective concentration. In one embodiment the G1 arresting effect dissipates so that the subject s CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells return to their pre administration baseline cell cycle activity within about within less than about 24 hours 30 hours 36 hours 40 hours or 48 hours of the from the point in which the CDK4 6 inhibitor s concentration level in the subject s blood drops below a therapeutic effective concentration.

In one embodiment a compound described herein and useful in the described methods may be synchronous in its off effect that is upon dissipation of the G1 arresting effect CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells exposed to a compound described herein reenter the cell cycle in a similarly timed fashion.

The rapid cell cycle reentry associated with the compound s rapid off effect advantageously allow for a larger number of CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells to begin replicating upon dissipation of the G1 arrest compared with other CDK4 6 inhibitors such as PD0332991. Accordingly CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells such as HSPCs can quickly begin to replicate during an off cycle period or during administration periods.

The present invention includes compounds and the use of compounds with desired isotopic substitutions of atoms at amounts above the natural abundance of the isotope i.e. enriched. Isotopes are atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers i.e. the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons. By way of general example and without limitation isotopes of hydrogen for example deuterium H and tritium H may be used anywhere in described structures. Alternatively or in addition isotopes of carbon e.g. C and C may be used. A preferred isotopic substitution is deuterium for hydrogen at one or more locations on the molecule to improve the performance of the drug. The deuterium can be bound in a location of bond breakage during metabolism an deuterium kinetic isotope effect or next to or near the site of bond breakage a deuterium kinetic isotope effect .

Substitution with isotopes such as deuterium can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability such as for example increased in vivo half life or reduced dosage requirements. Substitution of deuterium for hydrogen at a site of metabolic break down can reduce the rate of or eliminate the metabolism at that bond. At any position of the compound that a hydrogen atom may be present the hydrogen atom can be any isotope of hydrogen including protium H deuterium H and tritium H .

Tissue specific stem cells and subsets of other resident proliferating cells are capable of self renewal meaning that they are capable of replacing themselves throughout the adult mammalian lifespan through regulated replication. Additionally stem cells divide asymmetrically to produce progeny or progenitor cells that in turn produce various components of a given organ. For example in the hematopoietic system the hematopoietic stem cells give rise to progenitor cells which in turn give rise to all the differentiated components of blood e.g. white blood cells red blood cells and platelets see .

It has been found that certain proliferating cells such as HSPCs require the enzymatic activity of the proliferative kinases cyclin dependent kinase 4 CDK4 and or cyclin dependent kinase 6 CDK6 for cellular replication. In contrast the majority of proliferating cells in adult mammals e.g. the more differentiated blood forming cells in the bone marrow do not require the activity of CDK4 and or CDK6 i.e. CDK4 6 . These differentiated cells can proliferate in the absence of CDK4 6 activity by using other proliferative kinases such as cyclin dependent kinase 2 CDK2 or cyclin dependent kinase 1 CDK1 .

In certain embodiments the compounds useful in the described methods may provide for a transient and quickly reversible G1 arrest of CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells while providing for growth inhibition of CDK4 6 replication dependent cancers. By having a limited term transient effect the use of such compounds as chemotherapeutics allows for the faster reentry of the CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells into the cell cycle following cessation of the treatment compared to for example longer acting CDK4 6 inhibitors such as PD0332991. The quicker dissipation of the G1 arresting effect on CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells makes such compounds preferable over longer acting CDK4 6 inhibitors in situations where 1 the subject will be exposed to closely spaced treatments wherein the use of a longer acting CDK4 6 inhibitor would prohibit the cycling of the CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells between exposures 2 continuous or long term treatment regimens wherein the long term G1 arrest of CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells is a side effect of growth inhibition of the targeted cancer and the subject would benefit from the CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells quickly reentering the cell cycle following cessation of the treatment regime between dosing of the inhibitor in a continuous regime or between breaks in treatment in order to limit replication delay thus reducing limiting or ameliorating further healthy cell damage for example bone marrow suppression upon cessation of the treatment. According to the present invention chemotherapeutic regimens with the selective compounds described herein can be achieved by a number of different dosing schedules including on cycle off cycle regimes and continuous treatment regimes.

In one embodiment the compounds described herein are used in CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cell cycling strategies wherein a subject is exposed to regular repeated chemotherapeutic treatments for an Rb positive cancer. Such cycling allows CDK4 6 replication dependent cells to regenerate damaged blood cell lineages between regular repeated treatments and reduces the risk associated with long term CDK4 6 inhibition. This cycling between a state of G1 arrest and a state of replication is not feasible in limited time spaced repeated agent exposures using longer acting CDK4 6 inhibitors such as PD0332991 as the lingering G1 arresting effect of the compound prohibit significant and meaningful reentry into the cell cycle by the CDK4 6 replication dependent cells before the next exposure to the CDK4 6 inhibitor or delay the healthy cells from entering the cell cycle and reconstituting damaged tissues or cells following treatment cessation.

In one embodiment the use of a compound described herein provides for a rapid reentry into the cell cycle by CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells for example HSPCs so that the cells return to pre treatment baseline cell cycle activity within less than about 40 hours 36 hours 30 hours 28 hours 24 hours or less. In one embodiment the use of a compound described herein provides for a rapid reentry into the cell cycle by CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells for example HSPCs so that the cells approach pre treatment baseline cell cycle activity within less than about 40 hours 36 hours 30 hours 28 hours 24 hours 18 hours 16 hours 14 hours 12 hours or less. In one embodiment the use of a compound described herein provides for a rapid reentry into the cell cycle by CDK4 6 replicaton dependent cells so that the cells return to pre treatment baseline cell cycle activity within less than about 40 hours 36 hours 30 hours 28 hours 24 hours 18 hours 16 hours 14 hours 12 hours or less from the last administration of a compound described herein. In one embodiment the use of a compound described herein provides for a rapid reentry into the cell cycle by CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells so that the cells approach pre treatment baseline cell cycle activity within less than about 40 hours 36 hours 30 hours 28 hours 24 hours 18 hours 16 hours 14 hours 12 hours or less from the last administration of the compound. In one embodiment the use of a compound described herein provides for a rapid reentry into the cell cycle by CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells so that the cells approach pre treatment baseline cell cycle activity within less than about 40 hours 36 hours 30 hours 28 hours 24 hours 18 hours 16 hours 14 hours 12 hours or less from the point in which the compound s concentration level in the subject s blood drops below a therapeutic effective concentration. In one embodiment the CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells are HSPCs. In one embodiment the CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells are renal epithelial cells. In one embodiment the rapid reentry into the cell cycle is synchronous.

In one embodiment the use of a compound described herein provides for a rapid reentry into the cell cycle by CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells for example HSPCs so that a portion of the cells exhibit a level of cell cycle activity or are capable of entering the cell cycle and proliferate during a continuous treatment regime for example a treatment regime wherein the compound is administered for an extended period for example 5 continuous days 7 continuous days 10 continuous days 14 continuous days 18 continuous days 21 continuous days 24 continuous days 28 continuous days 35 continuous days or more. In one embodiment a compound useful in a described method is administered for a continuous period for example 21 28 35 days or more without the requirement for an off cycle period or drug holiday. In one embodiment the use of a compound described herein eliminates the need for an off cycle period drug holiday or reduction in co administered anti neoplastic compound concentration during treatment.

According to the present invention a compound described herein can be administered as a chemotherapeutic to a subject having an Rb positive proliferation disorder on any treatment schedule and in any dose consistent with the prescribed course of treatment. For instance the compound can be administered once a day twice a day or three times a day. The compound can be administered on alternating days or every third day or every fourth day or every fifth day or every sixth day or once a week. The compound can be administered every other week or monthly.

In one aspect of the invention the compounds disclosed herein can be beneficially administered in combination with another therapeutic regimen for beneficial additive or synergystic effect.

In one embodiment a compound method of the present invention is used in combination with another therapy to treat the Rb positive cancer. The second therapy can be an immunotherapy. As discussed in more detail below the compound can be conjugated to an antibody radioactive agent or other targeting agent that directs the compound to the diseased or abnormally proliferating cell. In another embodiment the compound is used in combination with another pharmaceutical or a biologic agent for example an antibody to increase the efficacy of treatment with a combined or a synergistic approach. In an embodiment the compound can be used with T cell vaccination which typically involves immunization with inactivated autoreactive T cells to eliminate an Rb positive cancer cell population as described herein. In another embodiment the compound is used in combination with a bispecific T cell Engager BiTE which is an antibody designed to simultaneously bind to specific antigens on endogenous T cells and Rb positive cancer cells as described herein linking the two types of cells.

In one embodiment the additional therapy is a monoclonal antibody MAb . Some MAbs stimulate an immune response that destroys cancer cells. Similar to the antibodies produced naturally by B cells these MAbs coat the cancer cell surface triggering its destruction by the immune system. For example bevacizumab targets vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF a protein secreted by tumor cells and other cells in the tumor s microenvironment that promotes the development of tumor blood vessels. When bound to bevacizumab VEGF cannot interact with its cellular receptor preventing the signaling that leads to the growth of new blood vessels. Similarly cetuximab and panitumumab target the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR and trastuzumab targets the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 HER 2 . MAbs that bind to cell surface growth factor receptors prevent the targeted receptors from sending their normal growth promoting signals. They may also trigger apoptosis and activate the immune system to destroy tumor cells. Another group of cancer therapeutic MAbs are the immunoconjugates. These MAbs which are sometimes called immunotoxins or antibody drug conjugates consist of an antibody attached to a cell killing substance such as a plant or bacterial toxin a chemotherapy drug or a radioactive molecule. The antibody latches onto its specific antigen on the surface of a cancer cell and the cell killing substance is taken up by the cell. FDA approved conjugated MAbs that work this way include ado trastuzumab emtansine which targets the HER 2 molecule to deliver the drug DM1 which inhibits cell proliferation to HER 2 expressing metastatic breast cancer cells.

Immunotherapies with T cells engineered to recognize cancer cells via bispecific antibodies bsAbs or chimeric antigen receptors CARs are approaches with potential to ablate both dividing and non slow dividing subpopulations of cancer cells.

Bispecific antibodies by simultaneously recognizing target antigen and an activating receptor on the surface of an immune effector cell offer an opportunity to redirect immune effector cells to kill cancer cells. The other approach is the generation of chimeric antigen receptors by fusing extracellular antibodies to intracellular signaling domains. Chimeric antigen receptor engineered T cells are able to specifically kill tumor cells in a MHC independent way.

In one aspect of the present invention a compound described herein can be combined with at least one immunosuppressive agent. The immunosuppressive agent is preferably selected from the group consisting of a calcineurin inhibitor e.g. a cyclosporin or an ascomycin e.g. Cyclosporin A NEORAL FK506 tacrolimus pimecrolimus a mTOR inhibitor e.g. rapamycin or a derivative thereof e.g. Sirolimus RAPAMUNE Everolimus Certican temsirolimus zotarolimus biolimus 7 biolimus 9 a rapalog e.g. ridaforolimus azathioprine campath 1H a S1P receptor modulator e.g. fingolimod or an analogue thereof an anti IL 8 antibody mycophenolic acid or a salt thereof e.g. sodium salt or a prodrug thereof e.g. Mycophenolate Mofetil CELLCEPT OKT3 ORTHOCLONE OKT3 Prednisone ATGAM THYMOGLOBULIN Brequinar Sodium OKT4 T10B9.A 3A 33B3.1 15 deoxyspergualin tresperimus Leflunomide ARAVA CTLAI Ig anti CD25 anti IL2R Basiliximab SIMULECT Daclizumab ZENAPAX mizorbine methotrexate dexamethasone ISAtx 247 SDZ ASM 981 pimecrolimus Elidel CTLA4lg Abatacept belatacept LFA3lg etanercept sold as Enbrel by Immunex adalimumab Humira infliximab Remicade an anti LFA 1 antibody natalizumab Antegren Enlimomab gavilimomab antithymocyte immunoglobulin siplizumab Alefacept efalizumab pentasa mesalazine asacol codeine phosphate benorylate fenbufen naprosyn diclofenac etodolac and indomethacin aspirin and ibuprofen.

In certain embodiments a compound described herein is administered to the subject prior to treatment with another chemotherapeutic agent during treatment with another chemotherapeutic agent after administration of another chemotherapeutic agent or a combination thereof.

In some embodiments the selective compound can be administered to the subject such that the other chemotherapeutic agent can be administered either at higher doses increased chemotherapeutic dose intensity or more frequently increased chemotherapeutic dose density . Dose dense chemotherapy is a chemotherapy treatment plan in which drugs are given with less time between treatments than in a standard chemotherapy treatment plan. Chemotherapy dose intensity represents unit dose of chemotherapy administered per unit time. Dose intensity can be increased or decreased through altering dose administered time interval of administration or both.

In one embodiment of the invention the compounds described herein can be administered in a concerted regimen with another agent such as a non DNA damaging targeted anti neoplastic agent or a hematopoietic growth factor agent. It has been recently been reported that the untimely administration of hematopoietic growth factors can have serious side effects. For example the use of the EPO family of growth factors has been associated with arterial hypertension cerebral convulsions hypertensive encephalopathy thromboembolism iron deficiency influenza like syndromes and venous thrombosis. The G CSF family of growth factors has been associated with spleen enlargement and rupture respiratory distress syndrome allergic reactions and sickle cell complications. By combining the administration of the short lived selective compounds described herein and methods of the present invention with the timely administration of hematopoietic growth factors for example at the time point wherein the affected cells are no longer under growth arrest it is possible for the health care practitioner to decrease the amount of the growth factor to minimize the unwanted adverse effects while achieving the desired therapeutic benefit. In one embodiment the growth factor is administered upon cessation of the effect of the compound on the CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells for example HSPCs. Thus in this embodiment the use of a selective compound described herein in an anti neoplastic therapeutic regime may allow the subject to receive a reduced amount of growth factor because the targeted hematopoietic cells will have reentered the cell cycle quicker than when other CDK4 6 inhibitors for example PD0332991. In addition rapid cell cycle reentry following G1 arrest using a compound described herein provides for the ability to time the administration of hematopoietic growth factors to assist in the reconstitution of hematopoietic cell lines to maximize the growth factor effect that is when the growth factors will be most effective. As such in one embodiment the use of the compounds or methods described herein is combined with the use of hematopoietic growth factors including but not limited to granulocyte colony stimulating factor G CSF for example sold as Neupogen filgrastin Neulasta peg filgrastin or lenograstin granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor GM CSF for example sold as molgramostim and sargramostim Leukine M CSF macrophage colony stimulating factor thrombopoietin megakaryocyte growth development factor MGDF for example sold as Romiplostim and Eltrombopag interleukin IL 12 interleukin 3 interleukin 11 adipogenesis inhibiting factor or oprelvekin SCF stem cell factor steel factor kit ligand or KL and erythropoietin EPO and their derivatives sold as for example epoetin as Darbopoetin Epocept Nanokine Epofit Epogin Eprex and Procrit epoetin sold as for example NeoRecormon Recormon and Micera epoetin delta sold as for example Dynepo epoetin omega sold as for example Epomax epoetin zeta sold as for example Silapo and Reacrit as well as for example Epocept EPOTrust Erypro Safe Repoeitin Vintor Epofit Erykine Wepox Espogen Relipoeitin Shanpoietin Zyrop and EPIAO . In one embodiment the CDK4 6 inhibitor is administered prior to administration of the hematopoietic growth factor. In one embodiment the hematopoietic growth factor administration is timed so that the compound s effect on HSPCs has dissipated. In one embodiment the growth factor is administered at least 20 hours after the administration of a compound described herein.

If desired multiple doses of a compound described herein can be administered to the subject. Alternatively the subject can be given a single dose of a compound described herein. For example a compound can be administered so that CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells are G1 arrested wherein due to the rapid dissipation of the G1 arresting effect of the compounds a significant number of healthy cells reenter the cell cycle and are capable of replicating shortly after exposure for example within about 24 48 hours or less and continue to replicate until a following administration of the compound. In one embodiment the compound is administered to allow for the cycling of the CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells between G1 arrest and reentry into the cell cycle to accommodate a repeated dosing treatment regimen for example a long term repeated dosing treatment regime.

In some embodiments the CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells can be arrested for longer periods for example over a period of hours days weeks and or months through multiple limited time separated administrations of a compound described herein. Because of the rapid reentry into the cell cycle by CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells for example HSPCs upon dissipation of the compounds inhibitory intra cellular effects the cells are capable of reconstituting the cell lineages faster than CDK4 6 inhibitors with longer G1 arresting profiles for example PD0332991.

The reduction in side effects in particular myelosuppression afforded by the compounds described herein can allow for dose intensification e.g. more therapy can be given in a fixed period of time which will translate to better efficacy. Therefore the presently disclosed methods can result in regimens that are less toxic and more effective. When appropriate the small molecules can be formulated for oral topical intranasal inhalation intravenous or any other desired form of administration.

A compound useful in the methods described herein is a selective CDK4 6 inhibitor compound that selectively inhibit at least one of CDK4 and CDK6 or through the inhibition of cellular replication of an Rb positive cancer. In one embodiment the compounds described herein have an ICfor CDK4 as measured in a CDK4 CycD1 ICphosphorylation assay that is at least 1500 times or greater lower than the compound s ICs for CDK2 as measured in a CDK2 CycE ICphosphorylation assay. In one embodiment the CDK4 6 inhibitors are at least about 10 times or greater more potent i.e. have an ICin a CDK4 CycD1 phosphorylation assay that is at least 10 times or more lower than PD0332991.

The use of a compound as described herein can induce selective G1 arrest in CDK4 6 dependent cells e.g. as measured in a cell based in vitro assay . In one embodiment the CDK4 6 inhibitor is capable of increasing the percentage of CDK4 6 dependent cells in the G1 phase while decreasing the percentage of CDK4 6 dependent cells in the G2 M phase and S phase. In one embodiment the compound induces substantially pure i.e. clean G1 cell cycle arrest in the CDK4 6 dependent cells e.g. wherein treatment with the compound induces cell cycle arrest such that the majority of cells are arrested in G1 as defined by standard methods e.g. propidium iodide PI staining or others with the population of cells in the G2 M and S phases combined being less than about 30 about 25 about 20 about 15 about 10 about 5 about 3 or less of the total cell population. Methods of assessing the cell phase of a population of cells are known in the art see for example in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002 0224522 and include cytometric analysis microscopic analysis gradient centrifugation elutriation fluorescence techniques including immunofluorescence and combinations thereof. Cytometric techniques include exposing the cell to a labeling agent or stain such as DNA binding dyes e.g. PI and analyzing cellular DNA content by flow cytometry. Immunofluorescence techniques include detection of specific cell cycle indicators such as for example thymidine analogs e.g. 5 bromo 2 deoxyuridine BrdU or an iododeoxyuridine with fluorescent antibodies.

In some embodiments the use of a compound described herein result in reduced or substantially free of off target effects particularly related to inhibition of kinases other than CDK4 and or CDK6 such as CDK2 as the compounds described herein are poor inhibitors e.g. 1 uM IC of CDK2. Furthermore because of the high selectivity for CDK4 6 the use of the compounds described herein should not induce cell cycle arrest in CDK4 6 independent cells. In addition because of the short transient nature of the G1 arrest effect the CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells more quickly reenter the cell cycle than comparatively use of PD0332991 provides resulting in the reduced risk of in one embodiment hematological deficiency during long term treatment regimens due to the ability of HSPCs to replicate between treatments.

In one aspect of the invention a compound disclosed herein can be beneficially administered in combination with any therapeutic regimen entailing radiotherapy chemotherapy or other therapeutic agents. In additional embodiments the compounds disclosed herein can be beneficially administered in combination with therapeutic agents targeting auto immune disorders.

In one embodiment the activity of an active compound for a purpose described herein can be augmented through conjugation to an agent that targets the diseased or abnormally proliferating cell or otherwise enhances activity delivery pharmacokinetics or other beneficial property.

For example the compound can be administered as an antibody drug conjugates ADC . In certain embodiments a selected compound described herein can be administered in conjugation or combination with an antibody or antibody fragment. Fragments of an antibody can be produced through chemical or genetic mechanisms. The antibody fragment can be an antigen binding fragment. For example the antigen binding fragment can be selected from an Fab Fab Fab 2 or Fv. The antibody fragment can be a Fab. Monovalent F ab fragments have one antigen binding site. The antibody can be a divalent Fab 2 fragment which has two antigen binding regions that are linked by disulfide bonds. In one embodiment the antigen fragment is a Fab . Reduction of F ab 2 fragments produces two monovalent Fab fragments which have a free sulfhydryl group that is useful for conjugation to other molecules.

A selected compound described herein can be administered in conjugation or combination with a Fv fragment. Fv fragments are the smallest fragment made from enzymatic cleavage of IgG and IgM class antibodies. Fv fragments have the antigen binding site made of the VH and VC regions but they lack the CH1 and CL regions. The VH and VL chains are held together in Fv fragments by non covalent interactions.

In one embodiment a selected compound as described herein can be administered in combination with an antibody fragment selected from the group consisting of an ScFv domain antibody diabody triabody tetrabody Bis scFv minibody Fab2 or Fab3 antibody fragment. In one embodiment the antibody fragment is a ScFv. Genetic engineering methods allow the production of single chain variable fragments ScFv which are Fv type fragments that include the VH and VL domains linked with a flexible peptide When the linker is at least 12 residues long the ScFv fragments are primarily monomeric. Manipulation of the orientation of the V domains and the linker length creates different forms of Fv molecules Linkers that are 3 11 residues long yield scFv molecules that are unable to fold into a functional Fv domain. These molecules can associate with a second scFv molecule to create a bivalent diabody. In one embodiment the antibody fragment administered in combination with a selected compound described herein is a bivalent diabody. If the linker length is less than three residues scFv molecules associate into triabodies or tetrabodies. In one embodiment the antibody fragment is a triabody. In one embodiment the antibody fragment is a tetrabody. Multivalent scFvs possess greater functional binding affinity to their target antigens than their monovalent counterparts by having binding to two more target antigens which reduces the off rate of the antibody fragment. In one embodiment the antibody fragment is a minibody. Minibodies are scFv CH3 fusion proteins that assemble into bivalent dimers. In one embodiment the antibody fragment is a Bis scFv fragment. Bis scFv fragments are bispecific. Miniaturized ScFv fragments can be generated that have two different variable domains allowing these Bis scFv molecules to concurrently bind to two different epitopes.

In one embodiment a selected compound described herein is administered in conjugation or combination with a bispecific dimer Fab2 or trispecific dimer Fab3 . Genetic methods are also used to create bispecific Fab dimers Fab2 and trispecific Fab trimers Fab3 . These antibody fragments are able to bind 2 Fab2 or 3 Fab3 different antigens at once.

In one embodiment a selected compound described herein is administered in conjugation or combination with an rIgG antibody fragment. rIgG antibody fragments refers to reduced IgG 75 000 daltons or half IgG. It is the product of selectively reducing just the hinge region disulfide bonds. Although several disulfide bonds occur in IgG those in the hinge region are most accessible and easiest to reduce especially with mild reducing agents like 2 mercaptoethylamine 2 MEA . Half IgG are frequently prepared for the purpose of targeting the exposing hinge region sulfhydryl groups that can be targeted for conjugation either antibody immobilization or enzyme labeling.

In other embodiments a selected active compound described herein can be linked to a radioisotope to increase efficacy using methods well known in the art. Any radioisotope that is useful against Rb positive cancer cells can be incorporated into the conjugate for example but not limited to I I Ir P Sr Au Ra Y Am Cf Co or Cs.

Of note the linker chemistry can be important to efficacy and tolerability of the drug conjugates. The thio ether linked T DM1 increases the serum stability relative to a disulfide linker version and appears to undergo endosomal degradation resulting in intra cellular release of the cytotoxic agent thereby improving efficacy and tolerability See Barginear M. F. and Budman D. R. Trastuzumab DM1 A review of the novel immune conjugate for HER2 overexpressing breast cancer The Open Breast Cancer Journal 1 25 30 2009.

An active compound described herein or its salt isotopic analog or prodrug can be administered in an effective amount to the host using any suitable approach which achieves the desired therapeutic result. The amount and timing of active compound administered will of course be dependent on the host being treated the instructions of the supervising medical specialist on the time course of the exposure on the manner of administration on the pharmacokinetic properties of the particular active compound and on the judgment of the prescribing physician. Thus because of host to host variability the dosages given below are a guideline and the physician can titrate doses of the compound to achieve the treatment that the physician considers appropriate for the host. In considering the degree of treatment desired the physician can balance a variety of factors such as age and weight of the host presence of preexisting disease as well as presence of other diseases. Pharmaceutical formulations can be prepared for any desired route of administration including but not limited to oral intravenous or aerosol administration as discussed in greater detail below.

The therapeutically effective dosage of any active compound described herein will be determined by the health care practitioner depending on the condition size and age of the patient as well as the route of delivery. In one non limited embodiment a dosage from about 0.1 to about 200 mg kg has therapeutic efficacy with all weights being calculated based upon the weight of the active compound including the cases where a salt is employed. In some embodiments the dosage can be the amount of compound needed to provide a serum concentration of the active compound of up to between about 1 and 5 10 20 30 or 40 M. In some embodiments a dosage from about 10 mg kg to about 50 mg kg can be employed for oral administration. Typically a dosage from about 0.5 mg kg to 5 mg kg can be employed for intramuscular injection. In some embodiments dosages can be from about 1 mol kg to about 50 mol kg or optionally between about 22 mol kg and about 33 mol kg of the compound for intravenous or oral administration. An oral dosage form can include any appropriate amount of active material including for example from 5 mg to 50 100 200 or 500 mg per tablet or other solid dosage form.

In accordance with the presently disclosed methods pharmaceutically active compounds as described herein can be administered orally as a solid or as a liquid or can be administered intramuscularly intravenously or by inhalation as a solution suspension or emulsion. In some embodiments the compounds or salts also can be administered by inhalation intravenously or intramuscularly as a liposomal suspension. When administered through inhalation the active compound or salt can be in the form of a plurality of solid particles or droplets having any desired particle size and for example from about 0.01 0.1 or 0.5 to about 5 10 20 or more microns and optionally from about 1 to about 2 microns. Compounds as disclosed in the present invention have demonstrated good pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties for instance when administered by the oral or intravenous routes.

The pharmaceutical formulations can comprise an active compound described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in any pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. If a solution is desired water may be the carrier of choice for water soluble compounds or salts. With respect to the water soluble compounds or salts an organic vehicle such as glycerol propylene glycol polyethylene glycol or mixtures thereof can be suitable. In the latter instance the organic vehicle can contain a substantial amount of water. The solution in either instance can then be sterilized in a suitable manner known to those in the art and for illustration by filtration through a 0.22 micron filter. Subsequent to sterilization the solution can be dispensed into appropriate receptacles such as depyrogenated glass vials. The dispensing is optionally done by an aseptic method. Sterilized closures can then be placed on the vials and if desired the vial contents can be lyophilized.

In addition to the active compounds or their salts the pharmaceutical formulations can contain other additives such as pH adjusting additives. In particular useful pH adjusting agents include acids such as hydrochloric acid bases or buffers such as sodium lactate sodium acetate sodium phosphate sodium citrate sodium borate or sodium gluconate. Further the formulations can contain antimicrobial preservatives. Useful antimicrobial preservatives include methylparaben propylparaben and benzyl alcohol. An antimicrobial preservative is typically employed when the formulations is placed in a vial designed for multi dose use. The pharmaceutical formulations described herein can be lyophilized using techniques well known in the art.

For oral administration a pharmaceutical composition can take the form of solutions suspensions tablets pills capsules powders and the like. Tablets containing various excipients such as sodium citrate calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate may be employed along with various disintegrants such as starch e.g. potato or tapioca starch and certain complex silicates together with binding agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone sucrose gelatin and acacia. Additionally lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often very useful for tableting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may be employed as fillers in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules. Materials in this connection also include lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions and or elixirs are desired for oral administration the compounds of the presently disclosed host matter can be combined with various sweetening agents flavoring agents coloring agents emulsifying agents and or suspending agents as well as such diluents as water ethanol propylene glycol glycerin and various like combinations thereof.

In yet another embodiment of the host matter described herein there are provided injectable stable sterile formulations comprising an active compound as described herein or a salt thereof in a unit dosage form in a sealed container. The compound or salt is provided in the form of a lyophilizate which is capable of being reconstituted with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to form liquid formulation suitable for injection thereof into a host. When the compound or salt is substantially water insoluble a sufficient amount of emulsifying agent which is physiologically acceptable can be employed in sufficient quantity to emulsify the compound or salt in an aqueous carrier. Particularly useful emulsifying agents include phosphatidyl cholines and lecithin.

Additional embodiments provided herein include liposomal formulations of the active compounds disclosed herein. The technology for forming liposomal suspensions is well known in the art. When the compound is an aqueous soluble salt using conventional liposome technology the same can be incorporated into lipid vesicles. In such an instance due to the water solubility of the active compound the active compound can be substantially entrained within the hydrophilic center or core of the liposomes. The lipid layer employed can be of any conventional composition and can either contain cholesterol or can be cholesterol free. When the active compound of interest is water insoluble again employing conventional liposome formation technology the salt can be substantially entrained within the hydrophobic lipid bilayer that forms the structure of the liposome. In either instance the liposomes that are produced can be reduced in size as through the use of standard sonication and homogenization techniques. The liposomal formulations comprising the active compounds disclosed herein can be lyophilized to produce a lyophilizate which can be reconstituted with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as water to regenerate a liposomal suspension.

Pharmaceutical formulations also are provided which are suitable for administration as an aerosol by inhalation. These formulations comprise a solution or suspension of a desired compound described herein or a salt thereof or a plurality of solid particles of the compound or salt. The desired formulations can be placed in a small chamber and nebulized. Nebulization can be accomplished by compressed air or by ultrasonic energy to form a plurality of liquid droplets or solid particles comprising the compounds or salts. The liquid droplets or solid particles may for example have a particle size in the range of about 0.5 to about 10 microns and optionally from about 0.5 to about 5 microns. In one embodiment the solid particles provide for controlled release through the use of a degradable polymer. The solid particles can be obtained by processing the solid compound or a salt thereof in any appropriate manner known in the art such as by micronization. Optionally the size of the solid particles or droplets can be from about 1 to about 2 microns. In this respect commercial nebulizers are available to achieve this purpose. The compounds can be administered via an aerosol suspension of respirable particles in a manner set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5 628 984 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Pharmaceutical formulations also are provided which provide a controlled release of a compound described herein including through the use of a degradable polymer as known in the art.

When the pharmaceutical formulations suitable for administration as an aerosol is in the form of a liquid the formulations can comprise a water soluble active compound in a carrier that comprises water. A surfactant can be present which lowers the surface tension of the formulations sufficiently to result in the formation of droplets within the desired size range when hosted to nebulization.

The term pharmaceutically acceptable salts as used herein refers to those salts which are within the scope of sound medical judgment suitable for use in contact with hosts e.g. human hosts without undue toxicity irritation allergic response and the like commensurate with a reasonable benefit risk ratio and effective for their intended use as well as the zwitterionic forms where possible of the compounds of the presently disclosed host matter.

Thus the term salts refers to the relatively non toxic inorganic and organic acid addition salts of the presently disclosed compounds. These salts can be prepared during the final isolation and purification of the compounds or by separately reacting the purified compound in its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid and isolating the salt thus formed. Basic compounds are capable of forming a wide variety of different salts with various inorganic and organic acids. Acid addition salts of the basic compounds are prepared by contacting the free base form with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce the salt in the conventional manner. The free base form can be regenerated by contacting the salt form with a base and isolating the free base in the conventional manner. The free base forms may differ from their respective salt forms in certain physical properties such as solubility in polar solvents. Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts may be formed with metals or amines such as alkali and alkaline earth metal hydroxides or of organic amines. Examples of metals used as cations include but are not limited to sodium potassium magnesium calcium and the like. Examples of suitable amines include but are not limited to N N dibenzylethylenediamine chloroprocaine choline diethanolamine ethylenediamine N methylglucamine and procaine. The base addition salts of acidic compounds are prepared by contacting the free acid form with a sufficient amount of the desired base to produce the salt in the conventional manner. The free acid form can be regenerated by contacting the salt form with an acid and isolating the free acid in a conventional manner. The free acid forms may differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties such as solubility in polar solvents.

Salts can be prepared from inorganic acids sulfate pyrosulfate bisulfate sulfite bisulfite nitrate phosphate monohydrogenphosphate dihydrogenphosphate metaphosphate pyrophosphate chloride bromide iodide such as hydrochloric nitric phosphoric sulfuric hydrobromic hydriodic phosphorus and the like. Representative salts include the hydrobromide hydrochloride sulfate bisulfate nitrate acetate oxalate valerate oleate palmitate stearate laurate borate benzoate lactate phosphate tosylate citrate maleate fumarate succinate tartrate naphthylate mesylate glucoheptonate lactobionate laurylsulphonate and isethionate salts and the like. Salts can also be prepared from organic acids such as aliphatic mono and dicarboxylic acids phenyl substituted alkanoic acids hydroxy alkanoic acids alkanedioic acids aromatic acids aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids etc. and the like. Representative salts include acetate propionate caprylate isobutyrate oxalate malonate succinate suberate sebacate fumarate maleate mandelate benzoate chlorobenzoate methylbenzoate dinitrobenzoate phthalate benzenesulfonate toluenesulfonate phenylacetate citrate lactate maleate tartrate methanesulfonate and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can include cations based on the alkali and alkaline earth metals such as sodium lithium potassium calcium magnesium and the like as well as non toxic ammonium quaternary ammonium and amine cations including but not limited to ammonium tetramethylammonium tetraethylammonium methylamine dimethylamine trimethylamine triethylamine ethylamine and the like. Also contemplated are the salts of amino acids such as arginate gluconate galacturonate and the like. See for example Berge et al. J. Pharm. Sci. 1977 66 1 19 which is incorporated herein by reference.

Alternatively the lactam can be generated by reacting the carboxylic acid with a protected amine in the presence of a strong acid and a dehydrating agent which can be together in one moiety as a strong acid anhydride. Examples of strong acid anhydrides include but are not limited to trifluoroacetic acid anhydride tribromoacetic acid anhydride trichloroacetic acid anhydride or mixed anhydrides. The dehydrating agent can be a carbodiimide based compound such as but not limited to DCC N N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide EDC 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide or DIC N N diisopropylcarbodiimide . An additional step may be necessary to take off the N protecting group and the methodologies are known to those skilled in the art.

Alternatively the halogen moiety bonded to the pyrimidine ring can be substituted with any leaving group that can be displaced by a primary amine for example to create an intermediate for a final product such as Br I F SMe SOMe SOalkyl SOalkyl. See for Example PCT US2013 037878 to Tavares.

Other amine intermediates and final amine compounds can be synthesized by those skilled in the art. It will be appreciated that the chemistry can employ reagents that comprise reactive functionalities that can be protected and de protected and will be known to those skilled in the art at the time of the invention. See for example Greene T. W. and Wuts P. G. M. Greene s Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis 4edition John Wiley and Sons.

As can be seen in compound T shows more potent activity against MCF 7 cells than PD0332991.

Examples of representative compounds highly active against the proliferation of ZR75 1 breast ductal carcinoma Rb Positive cells are shown in . The compounds tested in Compounds T Q GG U H MM OO and PD 332991 all showed significant inhibition of cellular proliferation of ZR75 1 cells. As can be seen in compound T shows more potent activity against ZR75 1 cells than PD0332991.

In addition to breast cancer cell lines a number of the compounds disclosed herein were also evaluated against a small cell lung cancer cell line H69 and a human metastatic melanoma cell line A2058 two Rb deficient Rb negative cell lines. The results of these cellular inhibition assays are shown in Table 4. The range of the inhibitory ECvalues necessary for inhibition of H69 small cell lung cancer cells was 2040 nM to 3000 nM. The range of the inhibitory ECvalues necessary for inhibition of A2058 malignant melanoma cell proliferation was 1313 nM to 3000 nM. In contrast to the significant inhibition seen on the two Rb positive breast cancer cell lines it was found that the compounds tested were not significantly effective at inhibiting proliferation of the small cell lung cancer or melanoma cells.

The effect of PD0332991 on HSPCs has been previously demonstrated. shows the EdU incorporation of mice HSPC and myeloid progenitor cells following a single dose of 150 mg kg PD0332991 by oral gavage to assess the temporal effect of transient CDK4 6 inhibition on bone marrow arrest as reported in Roberts et al. Multiple Roles of Cyclin Dependent Kinase 4 6 Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. JCNI 2012 104 6 476 487 . As can be seen in a single oral dose of PD0332991 results in a sustained reduction in HSPC LKS and myeloid progenitor cells LKS for greater than 36 hours. Not until 48 hours post oral dosing do HSPC and myeloid progenitor cells return to baseline cell division.

Compounds of the present invention demonstrate good pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Compound T Q GG and U were dosed to mice at 30 mg kg by oral gavage or 10 mg kg by intravenous injection. Blood samples were taken at 0 0.25 0.5 1.0 2.0 4.0 and 8.0 hours post dosing and the plasma concentration of compound T Q GG or U were determined by HPLC. Compound T GG and U were demonstrated to have excellent oral pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties as shown in Table 5. This includes very high oral bioavailability F of 52 to 80 and a plasma half life of 3 to 5 hours following oral administration. Compound T Q GG and U were demonstrated to have excellent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties when delivered by intravenous administration. Representative IV and oral PK curves for all four compounds are shown in .

HS68 cells were seeded out at 40 000 cells well in 60 mm dish on day 1 in DMEM containing 10 fetal bovine serum 100 U ml penicillin streptomycin and 1 Glutamax Invitrogen as described Brookes et al. EMBO J 21 12 2936 2945 2002 and Ruas et al. Mol Cell Biol 27 12 4273 4282 2007 . 24 hrs post seeding cells are treated with compound T compound Q compound GG compound U PD0332991 or DMSO vehicle alone at 300 nM final concentration of test compounds. On day 3 one set of treated cell samples were harvested in triplicate 0 Hour sample . Remaining cells were washed two times in PBS CMF and returned to culture media lacking test compound. Sets of samples were harvested in triplicate at 24 40 and 48 hours.

Alternatively the same experiment was done using normal Renal Proximal Tubule Epithelial Cells Rb positive obtained from American Type Culture Collection ATCC Manassas Va. . Cells were grown in an incubator at 37 C. in a humidified atmosphere of 5 CO2 in Renal Epithelial Cell Basal Media ATCC supplemented with Renal Epithelial Cell Growth Kit ATCC in 37 C. humidified incubator.

Upon harvesting cells samples were stained with propidium iodide staining solution and samples run on Dako Cyan Flow Cytometer. The fraction of cells in G0 G1 DNA cell cycle versus the fraction in S phase DNA cell cycle was determined using FlowJo 7.2 0.2 analysis.

As shown in and similar to results in vivo as shown in PD0332991 required greater than 48 hours post wash out for cells to return to normal baseline cell division. This is seen in and as values equivalent to those for the DMSO control for either the G0 G1 fraction or the S phase of cell division respectively were obtained. In contrast HS68 cells treated with compounds of the present invention returned to normal baseline cell division in as little as 24 hours or 40 hours distinct from PD0332991 at these same time points. The results using human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells also show that PD0332991 treated cells took significantly longer to return to baseline levels of cell division as compared to cells treated with compounds T Q GG or U.

For HSPC proliferation experiments young adult female FVB N mice were treated with a single dose as indicated of compound T compound Q compound GG or PD0332991 by oral gavage. Mice were then sacrificed at the indicated times 0 12 24 36 or 48 hours following compound administration and bone marrow was harvested n 3 mice per time point as previously described Johnson et al. J. Clin. Invest. 2010 120 7 2528 2536 . Four hours before the bone marrow was harvested mice were treated with 100 g of EdU by intraperitoneal injection Invitrogen . Bone marrow mononuclear cells were harvested and immunophenotyped using previously described methods and percent EdU positive cells were then determined Johnson et al. J. Clin. Invest. 2010 120 7 2528 2536 . In brief HSPCs were identified by expression of lineage markers Lin Sca1 S and c Kit K .

Analysis in mice determined that Compound T Compound Q and Compound GG demonstrated dose dependent transient and reversible G1 arrest of bone marrow stem cells HSPC . Six mice per group were dosed by oral gavage at 150 mg kg of Compound T Compound Q Compound GG or vehicle only. Four hours before animals were sacrificed and the bone marrow was harvested mice were treated with 100 g of EdU by intraperitoneal injection. Three mice per group were sacrificed at 12 hours and the remaining three animals per group were sacrificed at 24 hours. Results are shown in as the ratio of EdU positive cells for treated animals at 12 or 24 hour time points compared to control. Compound T and GG demonstrated a reduction in EdU incorporation at 12 hours which was starting to return to normal at 24 hours. Compound Q also demonstrated some reduction at 12 hours and started to return to baseline at 24 hours despite the fact that oral bioavailability of Compound Q is low.

Further experiments were completed with Compound T examining dose response and longer periods of compound treatment. Compound T was dosed by oral gavage at 50 100 or 150 mg kg and EdU incorporation into bone marrow was determined at 12 and 24 hours as described above. Alternatively Compound T was dosed by oral gavage at 150 mg kg and EdU incorporation into bone marrow was determined at 12 24 36 and 48 hours. As can be seen in and similar to the cellular washout experiments bone marrow cells and in particular HSPCs were returning to normal cell division as determined by EdU incorporation in 24 hours following oral gavage at a number of doses. The 150 mg kg oral dose of Compound T in can be compared directly to the results of the same dose of PD0332991 shown in where cells were still non dividing as determined by low EdU incorporation at 24 and 36 hours only returning to normal values at 48 hours.

As seen in a single oral dose of PD0332991 results in a sustained reduction in HSPCs for greater than 36 hours. In contrast a single oral dose of Compound T results in an initial reduction of HSPC proliferation at 12 hours but proliferation of HSPCs resumes by 24 hours after dosage of Compound T.

The metabolic stability of Compound T in comparison to PD0332991 was determined in human dog rat monkey and mouse liver microsomes. Human mouse and dog liver microsomes were purchased from Xenotech and Sprague Dawley rat liver microsomes were prepared by Absorption Systems. The reaction mixture comprising 0.5 mg mL of liver microsomes 100 mM of potassium phosphate pH 7.4 5 mM of magnesium chloride and 1 uM of test compound was prepared. The test compound was added into the reaction mixture at a final concentration of 1 uM. An aliquot of the reaction mixture without cofactor was incubated in shaking water bath at 37 deg. C. for 3 minutes. The control compound testosterone was run simultaneously with the test compound in a separate reaction. The reaction was initiated by the addition of cofactor NADPH and the mixture was then incubated in a shaking water bath at 37 deg. C. Aliquots 100 L were withdrawn at 0 10 20 30 and 60 minutes for the test compound and 0 10 30 and 60 minutes for testosterone. Test compound samples were immediately combined with 100 L of ice cold acetonitrile containing internal standard to terminate the reaction. Testosterone samples were immediately combined with 800 L of ice cold 50 50 acetonitrile dH2O containing 0.1 formic acid and internal standard to terminate the reaction. The samples were assayed using a validated LC MS MS method. Test compound samples were analyzed using the Orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometer to quantify the disappearance of parent test compound and detect the appearance of metabolites. The peak area response ration PARR to internal standard was compared to the PARR at time 0 to determine the percent of test compound or positive control remaining at time point. Half lives were calculated using GraphPad software fitting to a single phase exponential decay equation.

Half life was calculated based on t1 2 0.693 k where k is the elimination rate constant based on the slope plot of natural logarithm percent remaining versus incubation time. When calculated half life was longer than the duration of the experiment the half life was expressed as the longest incubation time. The calculated half life is also listed in parentheses. If the calculated half life is 2 the duration of the experiment no half life was reported. The timely resumption of cellular proliferation is necessary for tissue repair and therefore an overly long period of arrest is undesirable in healthy cells such as HSPCs. The characteristics of a CDK4 6 inhibitor that dictate its arresting duration are its pharmacokinetic PK and enzymatic half lives. Once initiated a G1 arrest in vivo will be maintained as long as circulating compound remains at an inhibitory level and as long as the compound engages the enzyme. PD032991 for example possesses an overall long PK half life and a fairly slow enzymatic off rate. In humans PD0332991 exhibits a PK half life of 27 hours see Schwartz G K et al. 2011 BJC 104 1862 1868 . In humans a single administration of PD0332991 produces a cell cycle arrest of HSPC lasting approximately one week. This reflects the 6 days to clear the compound 5 half lives 27 hour half life as well as an additional 1.5 to 2 days of inhibition of enzymatic CDK4 6 function. This calculation suggests that it takes a total of 7 days for normal bone marrow function to return during which time new blood production is reduced. These observations may explain the severe granulocytopenia seen with PD0332991 in the clinic.

Further experiments were completed with Compound T and PD0332991 to compare the metabolic stability half life in human dog rat monkey and mouse liver microsomes. As shown in when analyzing the stability of the compounds in liver microsomes across species the determinable half life of Compound T is shorter in each species compared to that reported for PD0332991. Furthermore as previously described above and in it appears that PD0332991 also has an extended enzymatic half life as evidenced by the production of a pronounced cell cycle arrest in human cells lasting more than forty hours even after compound is removed from the cell culture media i.e. in an in vitro wash out experiment . As further shown in removal of the compounds described herein from the culture media leads to a rapid resumption of proliferation consistent with a rapid enzymatic off rate. These differences in enzymatic off rates translate into a marked difference in pharmacodynamic PD effect as shown in . As shown a single oral dose of PD0332991 produces a 36 hour growth arrest of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells HSPCs in murine bone marrow which is greater than would be explained by the 6 hour PK half life of PD0332991 in mice. In contrast the effect of Compound T is much shorter allowing a rapid re entry into the cell cycle providing exquisite in vivo control of HSPC proliferation.

MMTV neu mice were generated and observed post lactation with tumors observed with a median latency of approximately 25 weeks. Mice were enrolled in therapy studies when tumors reached a standard size 50 60 mm3 that permitted easy serial assessment. Tumor bearing mice were continuously treated with Compound T added to their chow 100 mg kg d or 150 mg kg d . MMTV c neu control n 9 Compound T 100 mg kg n 7 Compound T 150 mg kg n 6 mice were examined weekly to assess tumor development by palpation. Tumor volumes were calculated by the formula Volume width length 2. Tumor bearing mice were euthanized at the indicated times due to predefined morbidity tumor ulceration or a tumor size of more than 1.5 cm in diameter.

As shown in continuous treatment with Compound T 100 mg kg d or 150 mg kg d led to a marked reduction in tumor volume during a 28 day course of therapy. Several tumors displayed complete tumor regression and no resistance to Compound T was noted during the 28 day course of therapy. These data show that this HER2 driven mouse model is addicted to CDK4 6 activity for proliferation and Compound T is an effective agent in CDK4 6 dependent Rb positive tumors.

Preclinical characterization of compound T compound GG and compound U indicates that they inhibit CDK4 and CDK6 with an ICof 0.7 1.0 nM and 5 6 nM respectively. In tumor cells with functional Rb protein these compounds potently inhibit Rb phosphorylation resulting in a G1 arrest. The in vivo efficacy of the CDK4 6 inhibitors compound T compound GG and compound U was tested in the genetically engineered mouse model of luminal breast cancer. Tumors were serially assessed weekly using caliper measurements. Therapeutic intervention began once tumors reached 40 64 mm. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula Width Length 2. All three compounds were administered orally via medicated diets 100 mg kg d . Medicated diets were administered for 28 consecutive days and then stopped. RECIST criteria were used to assess objective response rates. The objective response rates were categorized based on the percentage change in tumor volume using the following categories CR complete response 100 response PR partial response at least a 30 decrease SD stable disease no change not a PR and not a PD and PD progressive disease 20 increase.

As shown in objective responses were noted in mice treated with compound T compound GG and compound U. Treatment groups were well tolerated with no clinical signs of toxicity no weight loss and no deaths associated with toxicity. The linear regression t test was used to determine statistical significance of tumor volume growth over time. All three cohorts were statistically significant compared to non treated cohorts compound T p

To test the ability of CDK4 6 inhibitors to induce a clean G1 arrest a cell based screening method was used consisting of two CDK4 6 dependent cell lines tHS68 and WM2664 Rb positive and one CDK4 6 independent A2058 Rb negative cell line. Twenty four hours after plating each cell line was treated with Compound T in a dose dependent manner for 24 hours. At the conclusion of the experiment cells were harvested fixed and stained with propidium iodide a DNA intercalator which fluoresces strongly red emission maximum 637 nm when excited by 488 nm light. Samples were run on Dako Cyan flow cytometer and 10 000 events were collected for each sample. Data were analyzed using FlowJo 2.2 software developed by TreeStar Inc.

In results show that Compound T induces a robust G1 cell cycle arrest as nearly all cells are found in the G0 G1 phase upon treatment with increasing amounts of Compound T. In the results show that in CDK4 6 dependent cell lines Compound T induced a robust G1 cell cycle arrest with an ECof 80 nM in tHS68 cells with a corresponding reduction in S phase ranging from 28 at baseline to 6 at the highest concentration shown. Upon treatment with Compound T 300 nM there was a similar reduction in the S phase population and an increase in G1 arrested cells in both CDK4 6 dependent cell lines tHS68 Compare and WM2664 Compare but not in the CDK4 6 independent A2058 Compare cell line. The CDK4 6 independent cell line shows no effect in the presence of inhibitor.

The CDK4 6 cyclin D complex is essential for progression from G1 to the S phase of the DNA cell cycle. This complex phosphorylates the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein Rb . To demonstrate the impact of CDK4 6 inhibition on Rb phosphorylation pRb Compound T was exposed to three cell lines two CDK4 6 dependent tHS68 WM2664 Rb positive and one CDK4 6 independent A2058 Rb negative . Twenty four hours after seeding cells were treated with Compound T at 300 nM final concentration for 4 8 16 and 24 hours. Samples were lysed and protein was assayed by western blot analysis. Rb phosphorylation was measured at two sites targeted by the CDK4 6 cyclin D complex Ser780 and Ser807 811 using species specific antibodies. Results demonstrate that Compound T blocks Rb phosphorylation in Rb dependent cell lines by 16 hours post exposure while having no effect on Rb independent cells .
