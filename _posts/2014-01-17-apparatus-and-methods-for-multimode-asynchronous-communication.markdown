This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 795 868 entitled Apparatus and Methods for Multi Mode Asynchronous Communication filed Mar. 12 2013 which claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 636 923 entitled Apparatus and Methods for Multi Mode Asynchronous Communication filed on Apr. 23 2012 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Embodiments described herein relate generally to voice and data communications and more particularly to apparatus and methods for multi mode asynchronous communications.

In today s society advances in technology allow individuals to use multiple modes of communication from a home or office and while on the go. Individuals can communicate using voice text messaging instant message email or the like. Accordingly infrastructure exists to support these modes of communication yet the infrastructure is often designed to support an uninterrupted conversation through a single mode of communication. Thus it is difficult to have a unified multi mode communication that spans a series of interactions that might be required to complete a transaction.

In addition the advances in technology have enabled some individuals to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. As a result a cultural shift has begun toward a more fast paced efficient and user controlled customer self service. However many enterprises offer a customer service system that is inadequate unreliable synchronous and or not sufficiently customer friendly. For example in some instances an individual may be interrupted while in the progress of interacting with a customer support organization or system e.g. an interactive voice response IVR system by other obligations thereby negating the value of at least a portion of the progress made. Furthermore most customer service systems require a single mode of communication be used to fully complete a specific task.

Apparatus and methods for multi mode asynchronous communication are described herein. In some embodiments a method includes receiving at a host device a first communication associated with a transaction from at least one electronic device included in a set of electronic devices. The host device includes at least a memory a processor and a database. The first communication is received at a first time and via a first communication mode. The method includes sending a response to the first communication at a second time after the first time and independent of the first time. The host device receives a second communication associated with the transaction from the at least one electronic device at a third time. The first communication the response to the first communication and the second communication are displayable in a persistent record of the transaction regardless of a difference between the first time and the third time.

The electronic device includes at least a processor a memory and a display . The memory can be for example a random access memory RAM a memory buffer a hard drive a read only memory ROM an erasable programmable read only memory EPROM and or so forth. In some embodiments the memory of the electronic device stores instructions to cause the processor to execute modules processes and or functions associated with using a personal computer application mobile application an internet web browser and or the like. Furthermore the memory stores instructions to cause the processor to send signal information to the display .

The processor of the client device can be any suitable processing device configured to run and or execute a set of instructions or code. For example the processor can be a general purpose processor a central processing unit CPU an accelerated processing unit APU and or the like. The processor can be configured to run and or execute a set of instructions or code stored in the memory associated with using a personal computer application a mobile application an internet web browser telephonic or cellular communication and or the like. More specifically in some instances the processor can execute a set of instructions or code stored in the memory associated with an asynchronous communication with for example the host device .

The display of the client device can be any suitable display configured to provide a user interface to the client device . For example the display can be a cathode ray tube CRT monitor a liquid crystal display LCD monitor a light emitting diode LED monitor and or the like. The display can be configured to provide the user interface for a personal computer application mobile application internet web browser and or the like. In such embodiments the display can be configured to graphically represent any suitable portion of a customer service system and or process e.g. a webpage contact information an instant message interface an email interface and or the like . In some embodiments the display can be and or include a touch screen.

While not shown in in some embodiments the electronic device can include one or more network interface devices e.g. a network interface card configured to connect the electronic device to the network N. For example the network interface device can include a Wifi and or cellular transceiver.

The host device can be any type of device configured to send data over the network N to and or receive data from one or more client device . In some embodiments the host device can be configured to function as for example a server device e.g. a web server device a network management device and or so forth. The host device includes at least a processor a memory and a database . The memory can be for example a random access memory RAM a memory buffer a hard drive a database an erasable programmable read only memory EPROM an electrically erasable read only memory EEPROM a read only memory ROM and or so forth. In some instances the memory of the host device includes a set of instructions used to perform a user defined task. In such instances for example the host device is configured to communicate with multiple electronic devices using one or more suitable communication modes. In some instances the memory stores instructions to cause the processor to execute modules processes and or functions associated with a customer service.

The processor of the host device can be any suitable processor such as for example a general purpose processor a CPU an APU a network processor a front end processor and or the like. Thus the processor can perform a set of instructions stored in the memory . For example the processor can be configured to update the database with user information received from an electronic device e.g. the electronic device via one or more communication modes as further described herein.

The database of the host device can be any suitable database such as for example a relational database an object database an object relational database a hierarchical database a network database an entity relationship database and or the like. In some embodiments the database can be stored in for example the memory . While shown in as being included in the host device in other embodiments the database can be operably coupled to the host device . For example the host device can be in communication with the database over any suitable network e.g. the network N . In such embodiments the database can be included in or stored by a network attached storage device NAS . In such embodiments the NAS and or the database can communicate with the host device over any suitable network can be any suitable network e.g. network N .

The database can store and or maintain data associated with user information e.g. user preferences user communications user status user requests and or the like . More specifically and as described in further detail herein the database stores and or maintains a relationship between a user identifier and various methods of identifying that user. For example the database can store a relationship between a user identifier and that user s email address telephone number login name instant message identifier a communication device identifier e.g. a mobile phone identifier an internet protocol IP address a media access control MAC address etc. and or the like. Accordingly if the host device receives a text message and or a voice message from a telephone number the host device can query and or search the database using the telephone number for the user identifier with which that telephone number is associated. Similarly if the host device receives an email message from an email address or instant text message from a user having a text message identifier the host device can query and or search the database using the email address or the text message identifier respectively for the user identifier with which that email address or text message identifier is associated. Thus the host device can correlate information and or data received from a user via multiple communication modes with a single user account associated with that user.

In addition the database can store an identifier e.g. a status identifier associated with any step in a customer service process. For example in some instances the host device can be in communication with the electronic device to provide a user a customer service associated with booking an airline flight. In such instances the host device can store in the database an identifier associated with the completion of a process step e.g. login flight request travel dates flight confirmation and or the like . Thus if the customer service process is interrupted at a process step e.g. the user ends the communication between the electronic device and the host device the host device can be configured to resume the customer service at the process step when the host device is again placed in communication with the electronic device . Similarly stated the database can store any suitable user information such that the host device can provide an asynchronous customer service as further described herein.

As described above the processor of the host device can be configured to execute specific modules. The modules can be for example hardware modules software modules stored in the memory and executed in the processor and or any combination thereof. For example as shown in the processor includes and or executes a communication module an authentication module a processing module a database monitor module and an update module . The communication module includes a set of instructions executed by the processor associated with communicating with a network N and more specifically the electronic device . As described above the network N can be any network such as for example a public switched network PSTN a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN a virtual network a cellular network and or the internet.

The authentication module can be configured to query a database e.g. the database for a user identifier and or account number. In some embodiments the authentication module can query the database using a telephone number an email address an instant message identifier a social network account username and or password a private third party authentication identifier e.g. user logs in with the third party and or any other communication identifier e.g. a mobile phone identifier a MAC address etc. . For example if the communication module receives a SMS message from a mobile device the authentication module can query the database to determine with which user and or account that telephone number is associated. Similarly if the communication module receives an email from an email address or an instant message from an instant messaging account having an instant message username the authentication module can query the database to determine with which user and or account the email address or instant message username is associated. In some instances the communication module can receive a communication identifier and password combination. In such instances the authentication module can query the database to determine if the password is associated with the communication identifier thereby authenticating the presence of an authorized user associated with an electronic device.

The processing module includes a set of instructions executed by the processor associated with processing a customer service request. For example the processing module can include instructions associated with a speech recognition engine. In such embodiments the processing module can receive a spoken request from a user of the electronic device e.g. a telephone and can include instructions to cause the processor to interpret the request and perform an action based on the interpretation of the request. In other embodiments the processing module can receive any suitable service request via any suitable communication mode and include instructions to cause the processor to interpret the request and perform one or more actions based on the request.

The database monitor module includes a set of instructions executed by the processor associated with monitoring the database . For example the database monitor module can include instructions to cause the processor to query the database to determine if an electronic device e.g. the electronic device is associated with a user identifier an account number and or an unfinished customer service as described in further detail herein.

The update module includes a set of instructions executed by the processor associated with updating the database . For example in some instances a user associated with a communication mode and or an electronic device can communicate with the host device via a communication mode and or an electronic device not associated the user. In such instances the update module can receive a signal associated with an authorization to update the database and thereby associate the user with the communication mode and or the electronic device. In this manner the host device can associate any suitable number of electronic devices and or communication modes with a given user. Thus the host device can be configured to provide a multi mode asynchronous customer service to a user of any number of electronic devices associated with the user.

As shown in the host device can be in communication with an electronic device A via a first network N a electronic device B via a second network N and an electronic device C via a third network N. In some instances the electronic devices A B and C can be associated with a first user a second user and a third user respectively. In such instances the host device can communicate with the electronic devices A B and C substantially simultaneously. Furthermore the first network N the second network N and or the third network Ncan be similar networks or different networks. For example in some instances the electronic devices A B and C can communicate with the host device via a PSTN. In other instances the electronic devices A B and C can communicate with the host device via a first communication mode a second communication mode and a third communication mode respectively wherein each communication mode is different from the other communication modes.

In some instances the electronic devices A B and C can be associated with a single user. In such instances the host device can asynchronously communicate with the electronic device A the electronic device B or the electronic device C. For example in some embodiments a user can manipulate the electronic device A e.g. a home PC to communicate with the host device via a first network Nand during a first time period. The first network Ncan be configured to facilitate e.g. provide infrastructure to support a first communication mode e.g. via an ISP and the internet .

The user can discontinue the communication between the electronic device A and the host device and manipulate the electronic device B e.g. a mobile device such as a smart phone to communicate with the host device via a second network Nand during a second time period after the first time period. With the electronic device B associated with the user the host device can continue the communication e.g. a customer service process such as for example booking a flight from the point at which the communication ended with the electronic device A. In some instances the electronic device B can communicate with the host device via the first communication mode e.g. the second network Nis the same as the first network N . In other instances the electronic device B can communicate with the host device via a second communication mode e.g. SMS different from the first communication mode.

In a Similar manner the user can discontinue the communication between the electronic device B and the host device and manipulate the electronic device C e.g. a work computer to communicate with the host device via a third network Nand during a third time period after the second time period. With the electronic device C associated with the user the host device can continue the communication e.g. a customer service process such as for example booking a flight from the point at which the communication ended with the electronic device B. In some embodiments the electronic device C can communicate with the host device via the first communication mode e.g. via an ISP and the internet or the second communication mode e.g. SMS . In other embodiments the electronic device C can communicate with the host device via a third communication mode e.g. email different from the first communication mode and or the second communication mode. In this manner the user can asynchronously manipulate the electronic devices A B and C to communicate with the host device using any suitable communication mode to for example book an airline flight. Furthermore as described above the host device can store an identifier associated with for example the process steps of the customer service process. In this manner the customer service process is a linear process e.g. the progress made during the first time period is stored and accessed during the second time period and the progress made during the second time is stored and accessed during the third time period .

For example in some embodiments a processing module similar to the processing module shown and described above with respect to can process a customer service request and include instructions such that a signal associated with the result of the processing is sent to the electronic device e.g. via a communication module over any suitable network and or communication mode .

With the signal associated with the result of the processing sent to the electronic device the method includes receiving a signal associated with a customer confirmation of the result at . For example a host device can send a signal associated with flight information in response to a customer request for the flight information. In this manner the user e.g. the customer can engage an electronic device such that the electronic device sends a signal associated with a flight selection. Therefore the host device can be configured to process the user selected flight e.g. via a processing module or the like and complete the transaction at . In some embodiments the process of completing the transaction includes receiving a signal from an electronic device associated with payment information. In other embodiments payment information and or preferences are stored in a database and automatically applied. In this manner a user can engage an electronic device such that the user is provided with a customer service.

The method includes receiving at a device a first communication associated with a transaction from one or more electronic devices at a first time and via a first communication mode at .

In instances where more than one electronic device is in communication with the host device the electronic devices can be the same or different.

The host device sends at a second time after the first time and independent of the first time a response to the first communication at . For example the response can be sent to the one or more electronic devices via the first communication mode. Expanding further in some instances the host device can send a response to one or more electronic devices via the same communication mode that was associated with the first communication. In some instances the host device can send the response to the one or more electronic devices via a different communication mode. For example in some instances the host device can store e.g. in memory and or in a database a user profile and or a user preference that is associated with a preferred communication mode. In such instances the host device can send the response via the preferred communication mode regardless of the first communication mode.

At a third time the host device receives a second communication associated with the transaction from the one or more electronic devices at . In some instances the second communication can be sent via the first communication mode. In other instances the second communication can be sent via a second communication different from the first communication mode. For example in some instances the first communication mode can be an email and the second communication mode can be a SMS. The host device is configured to store and or display the first communication and the second communication in a persistent record of the transaction regardless of a difference between the first time and the third time. Moreover the host device can store and or display the response to the first communication in the persistent record of the transaction.

The second communication can be associated with a second step in the customer service transaction i.e. the transaction . For example in some instances the second communication can be associated with a request. For example the request can be for information such as a product price a location a process tutorial a request to speak with a customer service agent or any other suitable request. In such instances the host device can be configured to send a second response at a fourth time after the third time associated with the request. In this manner the electronic device can send any number of sequential e.g. one after the other or in other words each consecutive communication is at a later time the previous communication communications to the host device and in turn the host device can send a corresponding number of responses. In other instances the second communication can be associated with a user confirmation. In such instances the host device can be configured to execute an action based on the receiving of the second communication e.g. the confirmation . In some instances the action can be associated with a completion of the transaction.

For example in some embodiments a host device can include a memory that includes instructions that are executed by a processor. The instruction can be for example associated with providing at least a portion of a customer service process.

The electronic device receives a response to the first communication at a second time. The second time can be for example after the first time and independent of the first time e.g. asynchronous . In some instances the response can be sent to the electronic device via the first communication mode. Expanding further in some instances a host device can send a response to the electronic device via the same communication mode that was associated with the first communication. In some instances the host device can send the response to the electronic device via a different communication mode. For example in some instances the host device can store e.g. in memory and or in a database a user profile and or a user preference that is associated with a preferred communication mode. In such instances the host device can send the response via the preferred communication mode regardless of the first communication mode.

At a third time a second communication associated with the transaction is sent and the first communication the response and the second communication are displayable on the electronic device in a persistent record of the transaction regardless of a difference between the first time and the third time at .

In other instances the second communication can be associated with a user confirmation. In such instances a host device can receive the second communication and can execute an action based on the receiving of the second communication e.g. the confirmation . In some instances the action can be associated with a completion of the transaction.

After the identity of the user is verified the user can place a flight request A taking forty five seconds. In some embodiments the user can select specific travel dates travel times airlines and or the like. In this manner the customer service system can process the request and send a signal representing the result of the processing of the request. Furthermore the user can review the results and send a signal to the customer service system associated with a flight selection. As shown in research and processing A of the flight information can take two minutes.

The customer service system can further be configured to receive the signal representing the user selected flight and confirm the flight reservation A taking thirty seconds. With the user selected flight confirmed the customer service system can be configured to direct the user to a payment process A taking thirty seconds. In some embodiments the payment process includes entering credit card information PayPal information frequent flier information and or the like. With the payment information received the customer service process is completed taking a total time of six minutes and forty five seconds.

As described above is a timeline flowchart B illustrating the use of the customer service system with interruptions. Upon receiving a customer service request from an electronic device the customer service system includes placing the user of the electronic device in a queue B for two minutes and thirty seconds. Therefore the user must wait in the queue B until the customer service system is available to process the request. With the customer service request processed the user is directed to an authentication process B which takes thirty seconds to complete. In some embodiments the authentication process B requires a user input and or verification such as for example entering a password birth date a portion of a social security number and or any other suitable identifier.

After the authentication process B the user is interrupted by a Client Call. In this manner the user ends the communication between the client device and the customer service system. The customer service system is configured such that when the user places the electronic device in communication with the customer service system the customer service process is restarted. Thus the user must wait in the queue B for another two minutes and thirty seconds. Similarly the user is again directed to the authentication process B taking thirty seconds. After the identity of the user is verified the user can place a flight request B taking forty five seconds. The customer service system can process the request and send a signal representing the result of the processing of the request. Furthermore the user can review the results and send a signal to the customer service system associated with a flight selection. As shown in research and processing B of the flight information can take two minutes.

As shown in before the customer service system can confirm the user selected flight the user is interrupted with a Work Issue. In this manner the user ends the communication between the client device and the customer service system. The customer service system is configured such that when the user again places the electronic device in communication with the customer service system the customer service process is restarted. Thus the user must wait in the queue B for another two minutes and thirty seconds. Similarly the user is again directed to the authentication process B taking thirty seconds. After the identity of the user is verified the user again placing the flight request B taking forty five seconds. The customer service system processes the request and sends the signal representing the result of the processing of the request. Furthermore the user can review the results and send the signal to the customer service system associated with the flight selection. As shown in research and processing B of the flight information can take two minutes. The customer service system can further be configured to receive the signal representing the user selected flight and confirm the flight reservation B taking thirty seconds. As shown in the user can be interrupted again with a House Issue and therefore can end the communication between the client device and the customer service system.

When the user again places the electronic device in communication with the customer service system the customer service process is restarted. Thus the user must wait in the queue B for another two minutes and thirty seconds. Similarly the user is again directed to the authentication process B taking thirty seconds. After the identity of the user is verified the user again places the flight request B taking forty five seconds. The customer service system processes the request and sends the signal representing the result of the processing of the request. Furthermore the user reviews the results and sends the signal to the customer service system associated with a flight selection. The research and processing B of the flight information can take two minutes. The customer service system further receives the signal representing the user selected flight and confirms the flight reservation B taking thirty seconds.

Moreover the routing releasing reassigning etc. of the agents using the host device is transparent to the user e.g. the user is not aware of the routing releasing reassigning etc. .

In some instances the user response can be within the predetermined time period. In this manner the user response can be sent to the host device and the conversation state can again be saved. Furthermore the conversation screen can be updated with the user response and the agent can send a message in response to the message from the user e.g. the user response . Thus the customer service transaction is performed using a live chat between the user and the agent. While not shown in at any time during the customer service transaction the user can select to place a telephonic call to the agent. In this manner the conversation can be continued using a telephonic communication mode described above for example with reference to .

Referring now to a host device e.g. the host device described above with reference to can be engaged by a customer service agent to communicate with an electronic device as described above. The host device can be any suitable device configured to include an application e.g. an application is stored in the memory that can communicate with one or more electronic devices over a network. In this manner a customer service agent can engage the host device to interact with the application.

For example as shown in the application can display an agent desktop browser . In such embodiments the agent desktop browser can be configured to include one or more portions associated with any given category or process of a customer service communication. For example in some embodiments the agent desktop browser can include a portion associated with a list of active chats chats waiting on a customer chats waiting on the agent and or inactive chats. Moreover the agent desktop browser also includes a conversation portion an input portion and a notes portion. As described above with reference to the conversations discussed above the conversation portion of the agent desktop browser displays a persistent list of any or all the communications between the agent and a user account regardless of time differences and or regardless of receiving communications from more than one electronic device. For example the agent can select a conversation associated with a user account from the active chats list such that any or all communications between the agent and the user account are displayed as shown in . Similarly the notes portion can include any suitable note made by the agent associated with a user account.

The input portion is configured to provide a user interface with which the agent can input a response to a communication sent from a user account. For example in some instances the agent can input a response in text to be sent to the user account e.g. via SMS email instant messaging etc. . In some embodiments the agent can select the method of delivery based at least in part on a user preference. For example a user can define a preference associated with receiving responses via a SMS message. In other embodiment the response mode e.g. text voice image etc. can be based at least in part on the previous communication mode received from the user account. For example as shown in the user can send a communication from an electronic device associated with or comprised of an audio recording. In such embodiments the agent can play the audio recording and can take an action based at least in part on the audio recording. Moreover as shown in the agent can select a voice message link or button to record a response to the communication using the same communication mode e.g. voice recording . In some embodiments the response to the communication can be an automated message. For example in some instances an agent can record a message template associated with a frequently asked question. In such instances the agent can receive an audio communication from the user associated with the message template. Thus the agent can select and send the automated message in response to the communication from the user. As shown in in some embodiments the agent desktop browser can display a preview of a response prior to the response being sent to the user. In this manner the agent can provide a customer service to active users included in the active chat portion.

In some embodiments setting from the application e.g. preferences can be accessible in the settings menu of the electronic device.

In some embodiments the app can track usage sessions starting when a user authenticates with a PIN and ending when the app is closed or moved to background. In some embodiments the app can send undelivered usage session data to a host device when the app is sent to background. In some embodiments the app can track errors related to connectivity and send error data to the host device when connectivity is re established.

In some embodiments a user can manipulate an electronic device e.g. a mobile device in an offline mode. In such embodiments the electronic device may not receive a wireless signal or cellular signal sufficiently strong to connect to the customer service system e.g. below a given bandwidth threshold . For example in some instances a mobile device can detect if there is no signal and no Wi Fi connection includes airplane mode . In some instances a mobile device can ping a Mobile Gateway to detect poor bandwidth e.g. response time . In some embodiments all buttons that result in an API call or chat message are disabled and greyed out. In some embodiments the user can manipulate the electronic device to access all personal data. In some embodiments a user can leave a message in a general queue. In some embodiments the user can manipulate the electronic device to view for example a user s favorites favorite companies contact information favorite companies transaction data or the like. In some embodiments the user can view the top 20 inbox conversations with preview. In other embodiments the user can view all inbox entries that are not archived. In some embodiments a user can view the last 20 messages in a conversation. In some embodiments software development kits SDK can return codes to indicate when the electronic device is placed in an online mode.

In some embodiments the systems can include any suitable performance and or aesthetic feature. For example in some embodiments a home button need not require re retrieval of information whether application is minimized or maximized. In some embodiments a working spinning icon is presented when accessing backend data. In some embodiments chat messages are not scrolled across the window as they are loaded. In some embodiments active conversations are cached on the device. In some embodiments whole conversations are not re retrieved rather only the next message need be retrieved.

In some embodiments the systems described herein can be configured to gather information based on a user s behavior preferences or the like. Moreover the systems can gather information associated with the effectiveness of a customer service transaction. For example in some embodiments the system e.g. a host device can integrate and capture task goals and interaction points into automation. In some embodiments the host device can determine a user performance rating UPR during automation. In some embodiments the host device can determine a success index and or a navigation index. In some embodiments the host device can include for example adaptive playback control APC dynamic application smoothing DAS alternative message content AMC adaptive timeout control ATC best modality signaling BMS and or proactive transfer alert PTA systems.

In some embodiments the host device can be configured to predict and personalize menu options based on location. In some embodiments the host device can be configured to predict and personalize notification recommendations based on transactions executed.

In some embodiments additional information associated with a user can be sent to a host device when that user sends a process ID or other messages to the host device. For example an indication of a geographic location of the user can be sent to the host device with a process ID. Such a geographic location can be determined using for example a GPS module of a communication device and or any other suitable method. The host device can use the geographic location of the communication device to authenticate a user to provide recommended products services coupons and or promotions to a user to verify that a user meets requirements for a particular promotion e.g. must be in a specific geographic area to participate in a promotion and or the like. In other embodiments any other information e.g. time of day day of week purchase history website history etc. can be sent to the host device when a user sends a process ID or other message to the host device.

In some embodiments based on a user s interaction transaction with a particular application advertisements or offers that are based on and relevant to the transaction can be presented to the user. For example if a user books a plane ticket the user may receive offer s for rental car deals in the user s destination city. Similarly the user may receive advertisements or offers from restaurants hotels and or other services in the destination city. In some embodiments the user may receive deals from local taxi cabs or car services at the origin city. All of the information relevant to the user s travel planning is stored in the user s profile such that additional transactions can be completed with relative simplicity in an asynchronous manner.

If the user were to take advantage of the hotel offer the user would not need to enter his or her credit card number contact information etc. Additionally if the user was a frequent guest or rewards member of that particular hotel such information would already be part of the user s profile and would not have to be separately provided. In some embodiments the provider of the application e.g. the owner of the database described above could receive compensation based on offers advertisement through which a user makes a reservation or orders a particular product or service.

In some embodiments because the user s information is aggregated in a single location including the user s historical preferences and on going interactions can be used in various situations. In some embodiments if a user purchased an airline ticket through the system if the flight is delayed or canceled the user may receive a message indicating alternative flight options. As such the user can re book his flight at his convenience and additional services e.g. rental car hotel car service will automatically be updated accordingly. In some embodiments the user can receive messages from the additional service providers seeking confirmation of the modification. In some embodiments if the user purchased for example tickets to a sporting event but then modified their flight schedule such that the user was no longer able to attend the event the user could receive a message asking if they would like to seek alternative events and or if they would like to post their original tickets for sale on a ticket reseller site.

In some embodiments the system learns the user s preferences and responds accordingly. For example if each time a user interacts with the system he first opts to book flights between Washington DC and San Francisco each time the user returns to the system he can be presented with the option to do so.

The system described herein can be implemented such that it is an aggregator for an unlimited number of customer service sites. In other words the user s personal information that is stored through the system is linked to other sites. All of the various customer service options a user may need e.g. airlines hotels rental cars home improvement groceries restaurants etc. can be consolidated in a single location. In some embodiments a user is presented with an unlimited number of potential providers.
