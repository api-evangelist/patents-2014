This application claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 924 194 filed Jan. 6 2014 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The present disclosure relates to systems methods and devices for enhancing spectral efficiency in wireless networks.

Wireless mobile communication technology uses various standards and protocols to transmit data between a base station and a wireless communication device. Wireless communication system standards and protocols can include for example the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 3GPP long term evolution LTE the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE 802.16 standard which is commonly known to industry groups as worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX and the IEEE 802.11 standard which is commonly known to industry groups as Wi Fi. In 3GPP radio access networks RANs in LTE systems a base station may include Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network E UTRAN Node Bs also commonly denoted as evolved Node Bs enhanced Node Bs eNodeBs or eNBs and or Radio Network Controllers RNCs in an E UTRAN which communicate with a wireless communication device known as user equipment UE . In LTE networks an E UTRAN may include a plurality of eNodeBs and may communicate with a plurality of UEs. An evolved packet core EPC may communicatively couple the E UTRAN to an external network such as the Internet.

LTE networks include radio access technology and core radio network architecture that provide high data rate low latency packet optimization and improved system capacity and coverage. In LTE networks eNBs may have overlapping coverage areas. For example a UE near a cell edge of a first eNB e.g. a first macro cell to which it is coupled and thus may receive interference from a second eNB e.g. a second macro cell and or from other UEs coupled to the second eNB. In another example a first eNB that is a small cell e.g. a micro cell a pico cell a femto cell etc. may be partially or wholly within the coverage area of a second eNB that is a macro cell. There may be substantial interference between the small cell and the macro cell in commonly used time frequency resource blocks. To mitigate the interference almost blank subframes ABS may be utilized by the macro cell when a UE is in communication with the small cell.

In some instances geometry and or throughput of UEs and or eNBs may be improved by coupling UEs to small cells rather than macro cells. A UE may support cell range expansion CRE mode and may couple to a small cell even though a better signal is being received from a macro cell. The UE may have a handover bias greater than nine decibel dB for the small cell versus the large cell. However CRE UEs may have a very low geometry e.g. a low signal to interference plus noise ratio SINR and thus may be restricted to only being scheduled on ABS. Accordingly the gains from CRE may be offset and or entirely negated by the higher ABS rate particularly for high throughput UEs. In some instances performance may even be degraded. Thus there is a need for overlapping cells to more efficiently use available spectrum particularly when UEs are in CRE mode.

The ABS rate may be reduced and or eliminated if the UE is able to use interference cancellation IC to remove interference from neighboring eNBs and or other UEs. A macro cell and a small cell with overlapping coverage areas may use the same time frequency resources even while communicating with UEs employing a large CRE bias. In fact a large CRE bias may be beneficial by increasing small cell attach rate and accordingly potentially providing a higher traffic offloading gain as well as improving interference cancellation due to the strong interference signal received from the interfering eNB e.g. the macro eNB . Accordingly the spectral efficiency of the macro eNB as well as the small eNB may be improved by supporting IC.

In some embodiments a UE may include a Physical Downlink Shared Channel PDSCH IC receiver but strong interference may remain on a control region of subframes e.g. a Physical Downlink Control Channel PDCCH . It may difficult for the UE to decode the PDSCH without the control information and without using ABS. In an embodiment this issue may be resolved by including an advanced PDCCH receiver capable of handling the strong PDCCH interference in the UE. Alternatively or in addition cross subframe scheduling may be employed. Some ABS may remain to support legacy UEs without a PDSCH IC receiver. Accordingly the ABS may be used to transmit downlink scheduling information for PDSCH intended for the UE e.g. PDSCH transmitted on non ABS .

For a UE to utilize IC transmission parameters specific to each interfering PDSCH and cell specific parameters for each interfering eNB may need to be signaled from an interfering eNB e.g. a macro eNB or from a serving eNB to the UE e.g. to a CRE UE . Because some eNBs may be coupled to other eNBs with non ideal backhaul centralized scheduling and or exchange of scheduling and or channel state information may not always occur. Accordingly the interfering eNB may dynamically provide scheduling information for each interfering subframe for example by broadcasting a message including the scheduling information e.g. via the PDSCH . To conserve resources the scheduling information may be transmitted in a compact and or compressed format. Furthermore additional parameters may be transmitted using dedicated higher layer assistance signaling e.g. via Radio Resource Control RRC messages . For example the additional parameters may be transmitted semi statically by the serving eNB e.g. the small eNB using higher layer signaling defined by LTE release 11 in relation to further enhanced inter cell interference coordination FeICIC . Alternatively the serving eNB may signal the transmission parameters related to one or more interfering PDSCHs such as when the serving eNB is connected to the interfering eNB via a low latency backhaul and or when the transmission parameters for the one or more interfering PDSCHs do not change for a certain time period e.g. a predetermined time period .

The transmission parameters may include parameters specific to each interfering PDSCH. The parameters related to PDSCH transmission may be indicated to an intended UE via dynamic signaling and or semi static higher layer signaling. For example dynamic parameters indicated by dynamic signaling may include a physical resource block PRB allocation a precoding matrix indicator PMI a rank indicator RI a modulation and coding scheme MCS a redundancy version and or the like. Semi static parameters indicated by semi static higher layer signaling may include a transmission mode TM a UE specific power parameter e.g. Pin 3GPP TS 36.213 v. 12.2 and or the like. PDSCH codewords may be scrambled by a scrambling sequence and an initialization value of the sequence generator may depend on a cell identity cell ID and a radio network temporary identifier RNTI . For channel estimation based on UE specific reference signal RS the cell ID and RNTI may be needed for antenna port 5 and a scrambling ID SCID n a virtual cell ID that may be sent via higher layer signaling where DMRS stands for demodulation reference signal and n a DMRS port that may be sent via dynamic signaling may be needed for antenna ports 7 14.

The transmission parameters specific to each interfering cell may include parameters provided through FeICIC network assistance signaling for enabling cell specific RS CRS IC and or physical broadcast channel PBCH IC such as cell ID number of CRS ports multicast broadcast single frequency network MBSFN subframe configuration and or the like. A control format indicator CFI in a physical control format indicator channel PCFICH for an interfering cell may be detected by using the signaled cell ID and number of antenna ports which may also be obtained from decoding of the interfering cell s PBCH. The PCFICH may be transmitted on the same set of antenna ports as the PBCH . Additional information about the various transmission parameters discussed herein may be found in the specifications 3GPP TS 36.211 v. 12.2 and 3GPP TS 36.312 v. 12.2 and earlier versions of each.

In an embodiment the UE may decode the PDCCH associated with an interfering PDSCH to obtain transmission parameters for the interfering PDSCH. However this may require decoding over all possible RNTI values. Thus blind decoding of the PDCCH which may carry scheduling information for the interfering PDSCH may not be practically feasible and or may be resource intensive e.g. consume significant power from the UE . Moreover even after successfully decoding the PDCCH some transmission parameters e.g. a precoder determined according to the latest reported PMI may not be obtainable from the downlink control information DCI . However in an embodiment with a large CRE bias the macro cell attach ratio may drop significantly e.g. from 46 for no CRE to 17.4 for 18 dB CRE bias in an instance and the geometry of the macro UE may improve. Thus some radio resources of the macro eNB may be used for transmitting assistance signaling for PDSCH IC without a noticeable loss in performance for UEs coupled to the macro eNB. Dynamic assistance signaling may be applied to any inter cell interference scenario with IC receivers.

A reduced set of transmission parameters may be provided to the UE as dynamic assistance signaling and both dynamic and semi static parameters may be included in dynamic assistance signaling. Parameters sent via higher layer assistance signaling may not need to be included. In addition transmission parameters that are included may be sent in a compact and or compressed format. The reduced set of transmission parameters may be transmitted from the interfering eNB to the UE. For example a PDSCH carrying a broadcast message with the transmission parameters may be scrambled with an interference cancelation RNTI IC RNTI which may be a fixed value. For the UE to perform codeword level interference cancellation e.g. using a turbo receiver signaling of the interfering PDSCH s RNTI e.g. a size of 16 bits may be required which may increase signaling overhead significantly. Accordingly signaling overhead may be reduced by omitting the RNTI of the interfering PDSCH and assuming the UE will perform symbol level IC instead. In alternate embodiments the RNTI may be included in the signaling.

In an embodiment the dynamic assistance signaling may include a 20 bit per PRB signal for systems with a downlink DL bandwidth of less than 50 resource blocks RB and may include a signal including 21 bits per PRB signal for DL bandwidths greater than or equal to 50 RB. The parameters may correspond to a PRB in the first slot of each subframe and transmission parameters for PRBs in the second slot may be implicitly determined from the transmission parameters for the PRBs in the first slot of the corresponding subframe rather than being explicitly signaled.

For example a first three bits a a a of the signal may include a UE specific power parameter P. The eight possible values for Pmay be 6 4.77 3 1.77 0 1 2 3 dB in an embodiment. The fourth bit a may indicate whether virtual resource block VRB assignments are localized or distributed. If the VRB assignment is localized transmission parameters for each PRB in the first slot may be applied to the corresponding PRB pair. The fifth and sixth bits a a may indicate a transmission scheme. In an embodiment if there is one PBCH antenna port and the transmission scheme is not indicated as being UE specific RS based transmission a single antenna port transmission scheme using port 0 may be assumed. An embodiment of a mapping from bit values to transmission scheme is included in Table 1 

The seventh through thirteenth bits a a . . . a may indicate a modulation order and or number of codewords CWs . For example there may be 120 different possible modulation order and number of codeword combinations in an embodiment e.g. 81 cases for four codewords 27 cases for three codewords nine cases for two codewords and three cases for one codeword . Thus seven bits may be a compact low entropy encoding of the different possibilities. An embodiment of a mapping from bit values to modulation order and number of codewords is included in Table 2 

The fourteenth through sixteenth bits a a a may indicate a number of total transmission layers including for multiuser multiple input multiple output MU MIMO configurations. For UE specific RS based transmission there may be up to eight layers. For CRS based transmission there may be up to four layers. The antenna ports used for transmission of PDSCH may be the same as the set of antenna ports for PBCH. Because the transmission scheme and which RS based transmission scheme it is e.g. UE specific RS based or CRS based may be identifiable from other elements of the assistance signaling only three bits may be needed. For CRS based transmission the fourteenth bit a may be reserved.

The seventeenth through twentieth bits a a a a may have different meanings depending on whether UE specific RS based transmission or CRS based transmission is being used. For UE specific RS based transmission the seventeenth through nineteenth bits a a a may indicate the scrambling ID e.g. the virtual cell ID n and the twentieth bit a may distinguish between two possible cases for a given number of total transmission layers and codewords. In an embodiment it may be assumed that whether port 7 or 8 is being used may be blindly estimated. An embodiment of various cases for UE specific RS based transmissions is included in Table 3 

For CRS based transmission the seventeenth through twentieth bits a a a a may indicate precoders. There may be up to 16 precoders on antenna ports 0 1 or 0 1 2 3.

The twenty first bit azo may indicate a RB gap value for distributed VRB assignment. This element may only be present if the system bandwidth is 50 PRBs or larger. When the VRB assignment is distributed a value of zero may indicate that N N and a value of one may indicate that N N. When the VRB assignment is localized this element may be reserved. Various other orders and or combinations of bits and or various other mappings may be used in other embodiments.

Additional parameters may be provided to the UE by the serving eNB. The serving eNB may use higher layer signaling e.g. an RRC message to transmit the additional parameters. For example the serving eNB may transmit a cell specific power parameter Pvia higher layer signaling. The serving cell may also or instead transmit a set of candidate cell IDs for n which may be a smaller set of cell IDs e.g. eight cell IDs and or the like related to transmission and or reception points of potential cooperation.

Significant gains may be achieved from a large CRE bias and PDSCH IC when the system is heavily loaded and or when the small cell attach rate without CRE is low. Time domain resource sharing between macro eNBs and small eNBs with a small to moderate handover bias e.g. 0 6 dB may be good enough to serve traffic in a lightly loaded system. Accordingly unnecessary UE power consumption from monitoring assistance signaling and performing IC may be avoided by using ABS and indicating to the UE that assistance signaling is not being transmitted. A CRE UE may be required to decode the PBCH of the interfering eNB to perform PBCH IC. In an embodiment a master information block MIB transmitted in the PBCH may have 10 spare bits. Accordingly one bit may be used as an indicator informing the CRE UE whether or not monitor and decode PDCCH and or PDSCH scrambled by IC RNTI e.g. whether a broadcast assistance message is being transmitted . A CRE UE may receive the PBCH from the interfering eNB with much higher power than the PBCH from the serving eNB. However for homogeneous networks it may be more reliable to carry the indicator bit on the serving eNB s MIB and or system information block SIB . For the serving eNB to do so the interfering eNB may need to inform the serving eNB of whether or not to transmit the dynamic assistance signaling semi statically via an X2 interface.

The overhead of dynamic network assistance signaling may be further reduced by restricting the potential resources allocated to CRE UEs to a limited set of subbands in the frequency domain on some subframes. For example for a DL system bandwidth of 100 RB. 2100 bits may need to be transmitted to the CRE UEs if the CRE UEs are allowed to be scheduled over the entire bandwidth. The size of assistance information may increase linearly with the number of schedulable PRBs so signaling overhead may be greatly reduced by limiting the frequency resources on which the CRE UEs can be scheduled. Frequency selective scheduling may still be achievable by selecting subbands distributed over the entire bandwidth. Inter subframe frequency hopping and or staggering for selected subbands may further help to exploit channel diversity.

In addition applying frequency domain restriction to the allocation of resources to the CRE UEs may protect macro UEs. While the CRE UE may perform IC at the receiver the macro UEs may not cancel interference from small cell eNBs. Moreover higher transmission power may be required from the small eNB for communicating with CRE UEs versus non CRE UEs. Thus it may be beneficial to schedule low geometry macro UEs on subbands that are not used by CRE UEs as much as possible. The macro eNB may determine frequency domain scheduling restrictions for the CRE UEs based on the load information from small eNBs and its own system load. The eNB may signal its decisions to the small cell eNBs via the X2 interface. In an embodiment the scheduling restriction in the frequency domain may be applied only to CRE UEs. Non CRE UEs coupled with the small eNB may be scheduled to any subband so full frequency reuse between the macro eNB and the small eNB may still be achievable.

For some and or all of the previously discussed transmission parameters the value of the element representing that parameter may be selected to be a compressed and or compact representation of the transmission parameters. In an embodiment the minimum number of bits necessary to represent all possible configurations of a transmission parameter may be used e.g. a ceiling of a logarithm base 2 of all possible configurations for that transmission parameter . The UE may be able to use the bit values communicated to it to determine transmission parameters for one or more PDSCH interfering with the UE. Some parameters may also or instead be provided to the UE through higher layer signaling. The UE may be able to decode and cancel interference on the PDSCH using the received transmission parameters.

To reduce assistance signaling between the interfering eNB and the UE the UE may be restricted to only being scheduled on a portion smaller than the whole of all available subbands. The interfering eNB may determine to which subbands the UE should be restricted. The interfering eNB may indicate which subbands were selected to the serving eNB . The serving eNB may provide scheduling information to the UE and the scheduling information may comply with the restrictions selected by the interfering eNB . The interfering eNB may be configured to select the subbands so that they are distributed throughout the entire available bandwidth. In addition the serving eNB may schedule the UE with inter frame frequency hopping and or staggering for the selected subbands to exploit channel frequency diversity.

The frequency component of the time frequency radio resources may be divided into a plurality of subbands . The UE may only be allocated time frequency resources in some subbands e.g. the subband and may be restricted from being allocated time frequency resources on other subbands e.g. the subband . Despite the subband restriction the time frequency resource blocks allocated to the UE may be distributed throughout the frequency spectrum and the UE may receive the benefit of the spectral diversity available for the time frequency spectrum . In the illustrated embodiment the subbands are evenly distributed but they may be unevenly distributed while still being distributed throughout the entire available frequency spectrum in other embodiments.

An indication of allocated time frequency blocks may be received for example from the serving eNB. The allocated time frequency blocks may be restricted to a predetermined set of subbands to reduce the size of assistance signaling and or reduce interference. A broadcast message including indications of the transmission parameters may be received. The broadcast message may be decoded to determine the transmission parameters for interfering blocks. The transmission parameters may include UE specific transmission parameters and or cell specific parameters for time frequency blocks that may interfere with the allocated blocks. Some transmission parameters may be sent via higher layer signaling.

The transmission parameters may allow a signal from the interfering eNB to be decoded . In some embodiments the signal may be demodulated to a symbol level but error correction e.g. using a turbo receiver may not be applied. Alternatively the signal may be decoded to a codeword level including performing error correction e.g. using a turbo receiver . Interference from the interfering eNB may be canceled from a signal received from the serving eNB. The interference may be canceled by modulating the decoded symbols and or codewords applying an estimated channel response and subtracting the result from the signal. The signal from the serving cell with the interference canceled may be decoded to obtain the contents of the signal from the serving cell.
