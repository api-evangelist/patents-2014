title: Dynamic determination of local and remote API calls
abstract: Some embodiments provide a system and method for dynamically determining whether to execute a function locally or remotely for an application operating on a first device. The method, while the application is operating, identifies a set of conditions the evaluation of which dynamically determines whether to (i) direct a second device to remotely process a function or (ii) locally process the function on the first device. The method evaluates the identified set of conditions on the first device. When the evaluation of the set of conditions corresponds to remote processing of the function, the method directs the second device to process the function and return a response to the first device. When the evaluation of the set of conditions corresponds to local processing of the function, the method processes the function on the first device.
