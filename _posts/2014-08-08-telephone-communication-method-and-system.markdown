The present patent application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 161 075 filed Jul. 16 2008 which will issue as U.S. Pat. No. 8 804 924 on Aug. 12 2014 which is a non provisional application of International Application No. PCT GB2007 000115 filed 16 Jan. 2007 and further claims priority to United Kingdom Application No. GB0600812.2 filed 16 Jan. 2006 and United Kingdom Application No. GB0605396.1 filed 16 Mar. 2006.

The present invention concerns telecommunications methods and systems and more particularly methods and systems for enabling respondents who may be potential customers to respond to advertisements for items goods or services advertised by or on behalf of advertisers.

Call redirection is an increasingly common feature of the present day telecommunications market and exchange switches can be set to automatically route incoming calls e.g. customer enquiries to designated parties if required.

In general terms the present invention aims to provide a service for enabling response to advertisements such as classified or display classified advertisements in publications and to this end there are provided telecommunications methods and systems providing selective communication routing or forwarding to advertisers of communications made to anonymous contact identifiers selected from a pool of anonymous contact identifiers each anonymous contact identifier able to be allocated to an item to be advertised by or on behalf of the advertiser.

The anonymous contact identifier may be a publicly accessible telephone number or an email address for example.

In accordance with one aspect of the invention there is provided a telecommunications method using a telecommunication system for enabling delivery of third party promotional prompts to respondents responding to advertisements for items advertised by or on behalf of advertisers comprising the steps of 

Preferably the third party promotional prompt is also selected in accordance with an attribute of the respondent.

Preferably the method includes the step of before routing or forwarding the communication to said advertiser providing a third party promotional prompt to the advertiser.

Preferably the ACI is an allocated telephone number in which case the communication from a respondent to said ACI is a telephone call from a respondent caller dialing the allocated telephone number and said promotional prompt is the playback of a recorded telephone advertisement. The ACI may also comprise a telephone number in combination with a PIN or reference number which may be entered after dialing or optionally at the time of dialing.

Alternatively or in addition the ACI is an allocated email address in which case the communication from a respondent to said ACI is an email message sent from a respondent to the allocated email address and said promotional prompt is the provision to the respondent of an electronic advertisement.

According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a telecommunications system for enabling delivery of third party promotional prompts to respondents responding to advertisements for items advertised by or on behalf of advertisers the system including 

Preferably the system further includes a database for storing contact details for a third party associated with the promotional prompt said second telecommunications unit including means for using said third party contact details for providing direct connection with said third party associated with the promotional prompt.

In accordance with a further aspect of the invention there is provided a telecommunications method using a telecommunication system for enabling respondents to respond to advertisements for items advertised by or on behalf of advertisers comprising the steps of 

Preferably the method further includes the step of before routing or forwarding the communication to said advertiser providing a third party promotional prompt to the respondent.

Preferably the method further includes the step of before routing or forwarding the communication to said advertiser providing a third party promotional prompt to the advertiser.

Preferably the method further includes the step of selectively connecting the respondent or advertiser with a third party associated with the promotional prompt.

The ACI may be an allocated telephone number and the communication from a respondent to said ACI may be a telephone call from a respondent caller dialing the allocated telephone number. The ACI may also comprise a telephone number in combination with a PIN or reference number which may be entered after dialing or optionally at the time of dialing.

Alternatively the ACI may be an allocated email address and the communication from a respondent to said ACI may be an email message sent from a respondent to the allocated email address.

The step of forwarding the ACI for provision to respondents preferably comprises providing the ACI to the advertiser or to a partner party representing one or more advertisers so enabling the advertiser or the partner party to make the ACI available to the public.

Preferably on allocating an ACI to an item to be advertised the method includes associating the ACI with a prescribed lifetime and once the lifetime has expired making the ACI available for allocating to a different item to be advertised.

In a preferred form the status is able to be updated by or on behalf of the advertiser or a partner party representing one or more advertisers.

The ACI and the associated status are preferably stored in a database at or accessible by a system controller station and the communication from a respondent to the ACI is received by the system controller station. The database may comprise two or more database subsets.

In a preferred form the method includes the step of storing on the database a plurality of ACIs each ACT stored in association with an item a status and advertiser contact details to enable the routing or forwarding of the communication to the advertiser.

Said advertiser contact details then may comprise one or more advertiser telephone numbers or one or more advertiser email addresses for example and the step of routing or forwarding the communication to said advertiser is carried out in accordance with the stored advertiser contact details such as diverting a telephone call to an advertiser telephone number or forwarding a received email to an advertiser email address.

The allocation of an ACI to a particular item may take the form of associating the ACI with an item identifier code.

In a preferred form the allocation of the ACI from a pool of ACIs to an item to be advertised has a prescribed lifetime and the prescribed lifetime is stored in said database. The prescribed lifetime may take the form of an expiry date or time.

The status corresponding to the item not being available for sale may be an indication that the item has been sold or may be an indication that the prescribed lifetime of the allocation of the ACI to the item has expired in which case the ACI is available for allocation to another item. Preferably if the status associated with the ACI corresponds to the item not being available for sale a message is returned to the respondent in accordance with whether the status represents an indication that the item has been sold or an indication that the prescribed lifetime of the allocation of the ACI to the item has expired.

Each ACI in the pool may therefore always be associated with a status the status changing to dynamically provide a representation of whether or not it is allocated to an item and if so allocated whether that item is available for sale or has been sold.

In one form of the invention the pool of ACIs is uniquely associated with a partner party at least for a certain period the partner party representing one or more advertisers such that during that period the ACI can only be allocated to an item advertised by or on behalf of an advertiser represented by said partner party. Preferably said pool is a sub pool of a total pool of ACIs.

Preferably the method includes enabling the partner party or the advertiser to selectively update the status of the ACI.

In addition the method includes enabling the partner party or the advertiser to selectively update the prescribed lifetime of the allocation to the item to be advertised.

In addition or alternatively the method includes enabling the partner party or the advertiser to provide or modify the message provided to the respondent if the status indicates that the item is not available for sale.

In the case where the ACI is a telephone number for example the communication from a respondent is a telephone call and the CLIs are telephone call line numbers. Alternatively if the ACI is an e mail address the communication from a respondent is an email message and the CLIs are originating email addresses.

In this form of the invention the list of precluded CLIs may be associated with the pool of ACIs or may be exclusively associated with the particular ACI allocated to the item.

Preferably the method includes enabling a partner party or the advertiser to selectively update said list of precluded CLIs.

In this way a partner party such as a publisher of printed or online advertisements for individual advertisers may selectively prevent competitors from contacting advertisers by way of the allocated ACIs. Similarly a partner party or an advertiser may selectively prevent a particular respondent from contacting the advertiser e.g. if the particular respondent has been identified as known for wanton mischief or other nefarious activity.

The method may include preparing one or more reports including information selected from the group of number of ACIs allocated from the pool of ACIs number of communications made to ACIs from the pool length of communications made to ACIs from the pool and revenue accrued by communications made to ACIs from the pool and providing said one or more reports to an advertiser or to a partner party representing one or more advertisers.

In accordance with a further aspect of the invention there is provided in a telecommunications system providing selective communication routing or forwarding to advertisers of communications made by respondents to anonymous contact identifiers ACIs which may be telephone numbers or email addresses for example selected from a pool of ACIs each ACI able to be allocated to an item to be advertised by or on behalf of the advertiser a method of associating a sub pool of said pool of ACIs with a partner party representing one or more advertisers such that the ACI can only be allocated to an item advertised by or on behalf of an advertiser represented by said partner party.

The partner party may be the advertiser himself in which case the ACI can only be allocated to an item advertised by or on behalf of that advertiser.

Preferably this aspect of the invention comprises providing said partner party with an interface with the telecommunications system enabling the partner party to modify a status associated with said ACI the status serving to control whether or not a received communication made to the ACI is routed or forwarded to the advertiser of the item. The status may further serve to control whether if a received communication is not routed or forwarded to the advertiser of the item a message is provided to the respondent indicating that the item is no longer available or that the ACI is not allocated to an item.

Preferably the interface enables the partner party to customise the message received by the respondent in accordance with the status associated with the ACI if the ACI is in the sub pool of said pool of ACIs associated with the partner party.

In accordance with another aspect of the invention there is provided a telecommunication method using a telecommunication system providing selective call routing to advertisers of telephone calls made to telephone numbers selected from a pool of telephone numbers each telephone number able to be allocated to an item to be advertised by or on behalf of the advertiser the method comprising associating a sub pool of said pool of telephone numbers with a partner party representing one or more advertisers such that the telephone number can only be allocated to an item advertised by or on behalf of an advertiser represented by said partner party.

In accordance with yet a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of using a list of communication line identifiers CLIs of respondents which are to be precluded from access to an advertiser for use with a telecommunications system providing selective communication routing or forwarding to advertisers of communications made to anonymous contact identifiers ACIs selected from a pool of ACIs each ACI able to be allocated to an item to be advertised by or on behalf of the advertiser the method comprising the steps of 

In this way the system may be used to protect advertisers from access by competitors canvassing advertisers for business.

Preferably the method includes the step of in response to receiving a communication from a respondent whose CLI is on the list of precluded CLIs providing a message to the respondent. The message may be a stored message and may be selected from a plurality of different stored message in accordance with the CLI of the respondent.

In a preferred form this aspect of the invention may be carried out in combination with other aspects of the invention enabling the partner party to create a list of precluded CLIs and to associate said list with the sub pool of ACIs so that any communication made to ACI in said sub pool and received from a respondent whose CLI is on the precluded list is denied routing or forwarding to the advertiser.

The method may therefore comprise the step of associating a sub pool of said pool of ACIs with a partner party representing one or more advertisers such that the ACI can only be allocated to an item advertised by or on behalf of an advertiser represented by said partner party.

Preferably said partner party is provided with an interface with the communications system enabling the partner party to modify a status associated with said ACI the status serving to control whether or not a received communication made to the ACT is normally to be routed or forwarded to the advertiser of the item.

Additionally or alternatively the status further serves to control whether if a received communication is not routed or forwarded to the advertiser of the item a message is provided to the respondent indicating that the item is no longer available or that the ACI used is not allocated to an item.

Additionally or alternatively the interface enables the partner party to customise the message received by the respondent in accordance with the status associated with the ACI if the ACI is in the sub pool of said pool of telephone numbers associated with the partner party.

In accordance with another aspect of the invention there is provided a telecommunications method for enabling respondents to respond to advertisements for items advertised by or on behalf of advertisers including the steps carried out by a computer system of 

The user and the advertiser may be the same party or associated parties. The user may be a partner party representing a plurality of advertisers such as an advertising house advertisement facilitator or publisher the partner party responsible for publishing the advertisement represented by said advertisement identifier.

In accordance with another aspect of the invention there is provided a telecommunications system for enabling respondents to respond to advertisements for items advertised by or on behalf of advertisers the system comprising 

In one form the ACI is a telephone number the communication from a respondent to said ACI is a telephone call from a respondent caller dialing the allocated telephone number and the second telecommunications unit is a telephony unit.

In an alternative form the ACI is an email address the communication from a respondent to said ACI is an email message sent from a respondent to the allocated email address and the second telecommunications unit is an email receiving unit.

Preferably the system further includes means to associate the allocated ACI with a prescribed lifetime and means for making the ACI available for allocation to a different advertisement identifier once the lifetime has expired.

In accordance with a further aspect of the invention there is provided a telecommunications system for providing selective communication routing or forwarding to advertisers of communications made to anonymous contact identifiers ACIs selected from a pool of ACIs each ACI able to be allocated to an item to be advertised by or on behalf of the advertiser the system configured to preclude access to advertisers by a selected group of respondents identified by way of communication line identifiers CLIs comprising 

In one form the ACI is a telephone number the communication from a respondent to said ACI is a telephone call from a respondent caller dialing the allocated telephone number and the second telecommunications unit is a telephony unit. The ACI may also comprise a telephone number in combination with a PIN or reference number which may be entered after dialing or optionally at the time of dialing.

In an alternative form the ACI is an email address the communication from a respondent to said ACI is an email message sent from a respondent to the allocated email address and the second telecommunications unit is an email receiving unit.

Preferably the system includes an interface configured to enable the partner party to modify a status associated with said ACI the status serving to control whether or not a received communication made to the ACI is normally to be routed or forwarded to the advertiser of the item.

In a preferred form the system includes a stored message unit and the status further serves to control whether if a received communication is not routed or forwarded to the advertiser of the item a message is provided from the stored message unit to the respondent indicating that the item is no longer available or that the ACI used is not allocated to an item.

Additionally or alternatively the interface is further configured to enable the partner party to modify the list of precluded CLIs.

In accordance with another aspect of the invention there is provided in a telecommunications system providing selective communication routing or forwarding to advertisers of communications made by respondents to anonymous contact identifiers ACIs which may be telephone numbers or email addresses for example selected from a pool of ACIs each ACI able to be allocated to an item to be advertised by or on behalf of the advertiser a method of providing a partner party with an interface with the telecommunications system enabling the partner party to modify a status associated with said ACI the status serving to control whether or not a received communication made to the ACI is routed or forwarded to the advertiser of the item the method comprising sending a message via HTTP in a data content message format.

In accordance with this or any other aspect of the invention the message may be a status update request type selected from the group of and wherein 

The status update request or the rule update request is preferably incorporated in one or more tags forming part of said data content message format.

The method may include enabling said partner party to forward a batch of status update requests and or rule update requests. The batch of requests may be provided in the form of an input file forwarded to the system by way of the FTP protocol. In response to receiving and processing a batch of requests the system may include forwarding to the partner party a batch of allocated ACIs and or modification request confirmation messages. Such a response batch is preferably sent to the partner party as an output file in CSV comma separated value format and by way of the FTP protocol or as an email attachment for example.

According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a computer readable medium having computer executable instructions for performing a method using a telecommunication system for enabling respondents to respond to advertisements for items advertised by or on behalf of advertisers the method comprising the steps of 

According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a computer readable medium having computer executable instructions for performing a method using a list of communication line identifiers CLIs of respondents which are to be precluded from access to an advertiser for use with a telecommunications system providing selective communication routing or forwarding to advertisers of communications made to anonymous contact identifiers ACIs selected from a pool of ACIs each ACI able to be allocated to an item to be advertised by or on behalf of the advertiser the method comprising the steps of

According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a computer readable medium having computer executable instructions for performing a method using a telecommunication system for enabling delivery of third party promotional prompts to respondents responding to advertisements for items advertised by or on behalf of advertisers comprising the steps of 

According to yet a further aspect of the invention there is provided a telephone communication method for enabling callers to respond to advertisements for items advertised by or on behalf of advertisers comprising the steps of 

Preferably the allocation of the virtual telephone number from the pool of virtual telephone numbers to an item to be advertised has a prescribed lifetime and the status corresponding to the item not being available for sale represents one of 

In accordance with the invention then the service automatically assigns an anonymous contact identifier such as a publicly accessible telephone number referred to herein as a virtual number via its hosted platform to a customer normally an advertiser for a predetermined lifetime.

It is to be noted that an advertised item may be a good or service or may be a group of goods or services or a combination of goods and services. The advertiser may be an individual e.g. a person selling an item by way of a classified advertisement in a printed publication or on a website or offering an item by way of a hosted online auction site. Alternatively the advertiser may be an organisation such as a real estate agency or employment agency which may be offering a plurality of items properties for sale or rent for example or job vacancies to be filled in a printed or online publication in which case each item which may be a group of items is advertised with a separate AC.

The ACI such as a virtual telephone number acts as a front or proxy for the actual contact details e.g. the telephone number s of the advertiser ensuring that they may be contactable but without exposing their private contact details and thus having the potential to maintain their anonymity if required. The ACI is associated with a mapping to the status of the relevant advertisement.

The ACI may comprise one or more components that assist in retrieval of information in a database. For example in the case of virtual telephone number a certain digit or digits of the number may be interpreted by the system as representing a particular category of advertisements or may direct the retrieval process to particular subset of the database on which the information is stored.

It is to be noted that preferably the allocation of an ACI to a particular item is temporary only in accordance with the prescribed lifetime. This allows for re use of ACIs from a finite pool of available ACIs of particular relevance with regard to the use of virtual telephone numbers where the length of the number may provide an automatic restriction on the number of available ACIs.

The skilled reader will appreciate that the invention provides a very different approach to enabling controlled anonymous telephone communication between respondents and advertisers than those hitherto contemplated. In particular rather than providing a telephone number for an advertiser the particular advertisement identified by way of a particular reference number the invention includes the use of a pool of dynamically re allocatable virtual numbers CLIs for use by a particular partner. The virtual numbers are automatically rotated to new advertisements based on an algorithm designed around the lifespan of the advertisements.

The invention extends to methods and or apparatus substantially as herein described with reference to the accompanying drawings.

The invention also provides a computer program and a computer program product for carrying out any of the methods described herein and or for embodying any of the apparatus or system features described herein and a computer readable medium having stored thereon a program for carrying out any of the methods described herein and or for embodying any of the apparatus features described herein.

The invention also provides a signal embodying a computer program for carrying out any of the methods described herein and or for embodying any of the apparatus or system features described herein a method of transmitting such a signal and a computer product having an operating system which supports a computer program for carrying out any of the methods described herein and or for embodying any of the apparatus features described herein.

The invention extends to methods and or apparatus substantially as herein described with reference to the accompanying drawings.

Any feature in one aspect of the invention may be applied to other aspects of the invention in any appropriate combination. In particular method aspects may be applied to apparatus aspects and vice versa.

Furthermore features implemented in hardware may generally be implemented in software and vice versa. Any reference to software and hardware features herein should be construed accordingly.

With all aspects of the invention these may be provided in any appropriate form be it a method apparatus system stored computer instruction set etc. form. It will be appreciated that any feature of any aspect of the invention may apply to any other aspect of the invention.

This unique solution is of particular value to the advertising marketplace and is described in more detail below.

The service operates by allocating a virtual number against each advertiser s personal telephone number s . Centrally to the present invention at any time all virtual numbers are uniquely associated with a stage of sale status that determines what action the service is to initiate when the virtual number is dialed. A virtual number may be in any one of three states 

At the core of the virtual number service is a hosted platform where the software resides which allows the dynamic allocation of telephone numbers and is the interface between the advertising companies and their customers. Each advertising company can be seen as a partner reference of the facilitator entity running the hosted system or as a tenant of the hosted platform . Since the service is hosted the advertising companies do not require any hardware on their premises or directly under their control in order to assign virtual numbers to advertisements. The advertising companies communicate with the platform via specially designed publicly accessible interfaces.

The platform provides a reliable fully redundant and scalable system and is comprised of three interconnected primary components 

Telephony Servers These route callers to advertisers based on the status of the virtual number which is accessed via the database. Calls from callers are received by way of external telephony carrier switches via circuitry .

Database Servers These comprise an oracle database and secure FTP repository and contain all virtual number pools status and attribute values and actual advertiser telephone numbers.

Web Communication Servers This web server farm enables communication via the Internet with the advertising company tenants and also enable manipulation of virtual number attribute values.

The platform and its interrelation between all of its component s algorithms business logic and database schema has been fully designed and internally implemented and tested by the applicant.

The platform supports three publicly accessible interfaces for communicating with advertising partners to afford allocation of virtual numbers and manipulation of their status.

1. HTTP XML Schema Interface This interface supports partners connecting with the platform via HTTP and communicating using a uniquely defined XML schema. The schema is included in the Appendix below.

2. Web Application Interface A web based application is published by the platform s web servers. Partners may access the interface by an internet HTTP URL connection and logging in with their administrator username and password.

3. Batch Processing Interface A partner may supply a uniquely structured CSV text file containing thousands of advertisements that the platform parses and actions at predetermined scheduled intervals.

All three interfaces facilitate the following requests described in further detail below with reference to 

Allocate Ability to request a virtual number from a preconfigured pool of numbers by supplying a unique advertiser advertisement identifier one or more contact telephone numbers and an advertisement expiry date. All successful requests receive a live virtual number with the status value automatically set to For Sale .

Expiry Date The applicant has developed a capability which allows virtual numbers to be assigned a lifetime which is determined by how long the advertisement is to be in the public domain and is to be available to be called. This is controlled by the advertising company. When an advertisement s expiry date is reached the status of that number will automatically revert to Unassigned .

To ensure that virtual numbers are continuously recycled and made available to adverts within a finite pool of numbers an internally designed administration application is configured to continuously monitor the expiry dates of all virtual numbers. When a virtual number has expired the application automatically changes the status of that virtual number to Unassigned thus making it available for reallocation. The expiry date attribute facilitates the ability to automatically manage numbers within a finite pool.

The virtual number service of the invention is designed to be multi tenanted whereby each tenant is assigned their own finite pool of virtual numbers each to be reassigned to advertisements of that tenant as their status becomes Unassigned . This allows a relatively small number of virtual numbers to be constantly recycled which improves efficiency of cost and utilisation. Each tenant may set up or arrange for personalised caller greetings that enable the playback of marketing messages to callers to virtual numbers in their pool.

The platform allocates each tenant their own unique virtual number proxy service environment which contains the following information 

All environments are stored in the database and accessed by the communication and telephony servers when virtual numbers are requested or dialed. Furthermore a pool of virtual numbers may be comprised of any publicly accessible telephone numbers.

The applicant has developed the capability to associate a list of barred CLIs specific to a virtual number pool. By way of the CLI this service restricts access to advertisers from call sources via CLI the tenant wishes to bar from accessing their customer base. When the platform receives a call from a barred originating number it will play an appropriate message and terminate the call.

The platform supports two interfaces for advertisers to manage lists of barred numbers a web interface and a web service application programming interface. Both support the creation update deletion and assignment of CLI s to a list of CLI barred numbers to one or more pools of virtual numbers.

Allocate Step 1 The advertiser issues an Allocate request to the virtual number platform via public interface comprising the Internet and server the request containing a unique advertisement identifier for the advertisement to enable ready recognition by the advertiser advertiser s contact telephone number s and selected expiry date time.

Number Pool Step 2 The platform selects a virtual number with a status of Unassigned from the partner s number pool stored in the database .

Virtual Number Status Update Step 3 The status of the selected virtual number in the database is modified to For Sale and is associated in the database with the advertiser s contact telephone number s and expiry date time.

Return to partner Step 4 The virtual number associated with the advertisement identifier is returned to the advertiser and is immediately available for publication by the advertiser.

From this point onwards all calls to the virtual number will be automatically redirected to the advertiser s contact telephone number or numbers.

SetSold Step 1 Once the item advertised has been sold the advertiser issues via the public interface a SetSold request to the platform the request containing either the virtual number or the associated advertisement identifier.

Virtual Number Status Update Step 2 The platform then modifies the status of the virtual number from ForSale to Sold within the number pool in the database .

Acknowledgement Step 3 The platform responds to the partner with a return status of success to confirm the updated status.

From this point onwards all telephone calls to the virtual number will be greeted with a customised message as set or prescribed by the advertiser informing the caller that the item has been sold.

Edit Request Step 1 The advertising partner issues via the public interface an edit request to the platform the request including either a virtual number or the associated advertisement unique identifier.

Virtual Number Status Update Step 2 The platform modifies the information associated with the virtual number in the database .

Acknowledgement Step 3 The platform responds to the partner with a return status of success to confirm the updated status.

All subsequent telephone calls to the virtual number will be managed in accordance with the updated database information.

Extend Request Step 1 The advertising partner issues via the public interface an extend request to the platform the request including either a virtual number or the associated advertisement unique identifier.

Virtual Number Status Update Step 2 The platform modifies the information associated with the virtual number in the database .

Acknowledgement Step 3 The platform responds to the partner with a return status of success to confirm the updated status.

All subsequent telephone calls to the modified virtual number will be managed in accordance with the updated expiry date stored within database .

The following describes the virtual number call process and the internal call processing steps that the platform performs when a virtual number is called by a caller responding to an advertisement. illustrates the process when a caller is not barred from using a particular virtual number whilst illustrates the process when a caller is barred from using that number.

PSTN Step 1 Via the public switched telephone network a caller dials a published virtual number that is terminated on platform via telephony servers . The call may originate from a cellular PSTN or IP network.

Barred CLI Lookup Step 2 The CLI of the calling party is checked against the list of barred CLI numbers stored in the database the list associated with the virtual number dialed. If the caller is not identified as barred the process advances to Step 3 below. If the CLI identifies that caller is barred a prescribed message is played and the call is terminated see further description below with reference to .

Number Lookup Step 3 The platform accesses properties of the number dialed in the database to determine what action based on status value is to be taken with regard to the number called. As discussed above the actions associated with the status values are 

Contact Advertiser Step 4 The platform externally out dials in sequence the contact telephone number s associated with the virtual number. If no answer is received the platform informs the virtual number caller of the advertiser s unavailability and suggests they call back later.

Join Caller with Advertiser Step 5 If the advertiser answers the outdialed call the two callers are automatically connected for two way communication via the platform . To the caller this appears to be a direct connection with advertiser as represented in at .

PSTN Step 1 Via the public switched telephone network a caller dials a published virtual number that is terminated on platform via telephony servers . The call may originate from a cellular PSTN or IP network.

Barred CLI Lookup Step 2 The CLI of the calling party is checked against a list of barred CLI numbers stored in the database the list associated with the virtual number dialed.

Barred CLI Call Step 3 The caller is identified as a barred caller and is played a prescribed message customised by the partner. The call is then immediately terminated without involving contact with the advertiser.

As illustrated schematically in the system can include a further functionality to allow playing of third party promotional prompts such as advertising jingles in order to facilitate additional revenue streams for partners. This is of particular relevance in the context of classified advertisements where both respondents callers and advertisers are commonly individuals the associated partner being typically an advertisement facilitator or publisher.

A promotional prompt may be played to either or both the respondent and the advertiser prior to routing the communication ie. connecting the two parties . A wide variety of promotional prompts may be targeted at one or both parties in accordance with a variety of factors including 

In operation of a particular embodiment of this sub system when a respondent calls the advertiser s virtual number the platform includes programming to play a promotional prompt to the respondent in accordance with the content of the pertinent database . The prompt may be pre selected in advance or selected based on say the category of the advertisement or geographical location. The system then plays an additional promotional prompt to the advertiser after they have answered the call prior to connecting the parties. For example if the advertisement is associated with a car the system may be programmed to play the jingle of a selected insurance firm whilst the jingle of a particular holiday company is played to the advertiser.

PSTN Step 1 A caller dials a published virtual number ACI that is terminated on platform via telephony servers eg. via the public switched telephone network. The call may originate from a cellular PSTN or IP network.

Number Lookup Step 2 The status of the virtual number is determined via databases to identify what action based on state value should be taken with regard to the number and what promotional categories the advert falls within.

Promotional prompt playback Step 3 A promotional prompt stored on platform is played to the respondent based on rules in database .

Contact Advertiser Step 4 Via telephony servers platform externally dials the contact telephone number associated with the virtual number called or if multiple numbers the platform dials the numbers in sequence. If no answer is received the platform informs the respondent of the advertiser s unavailability and suggests they call back later.

Promotional prompt playback Step 5 Platform plays a promotional prompt stored on the platform to the advertiser based on stored rules.

Connect respondent to the advertiser Step 6 The two parties are connected in the usual way via the platform which appears to the parties to be a direct connection as represented at .

Employing this sub system a classified advertising partner may create a wide variety of additional revenue models based on any combination of the following 

The sub system is administered via a website interface which facilitates the uploading to the platform of soundfile promotional prompts and their playback definition When a partner requests a virtual number from the platform they may also identify the advertising category or categories into which the advert falls in order to enable category targeted prompt playback.

If the ACI is an allocated email address as opposed to an allocated telephone number then this aspect of the invention may be realised by providing the promotional prompt as a screen advertisement to the respondent or advertiser such as banner advertisements or browser pop up advertisements the advertisement selected in accordance with respondent or advertiser information or in accordance with the nature of the item advertised.

This aspect of the present invention may further include an interactive voice response IVR menu not illustrated offering both parties the opportunity during the call to talk directly with the promotional advertiser eg. the insurance firm whose jingle has been played . In operation when either party selects via DTMF entry or other to talk with the promotional advertiser the system is programmed to directly connect that party to the promotional company associated with the prompt advertisement. This may be accomplished directly while the caller is on the call or alternatively via a call back after the call has terminated. For example if a respondent is played a promotional prompt from a car insurance firm they may at any stage instruct the platform to connect them directly to that firm to obtain an insurance quote for the car that was advertised. In a similar manner the advertiser may elect to be connected to a holiday company after a sale has been agreed with a respondent.

This IVR feature affords partners such as publishers of classified advertisements a further potential additional revenue stream from their client base by offering a pay per response service a charge applying to each call lead presented to the promotional prompt advertiser.

It will be clear to the skilled reader that there are a variety of different partner integration solutions that may be provided with this service. Two such solutions developed by the applicant are discussed below by way of example.

With this service a programming API is published by the administrator of the platform enabling partners to dynamically request individual virtual numbers over the Internet. This interface facilitates the requirement of companies to assign virtual numbers to advertisements immediately upon entry of details on their own websites.

As discussed above with reference to the accompanying process flow illustrations the API functionality is as follows 

All communication with the API is executed over the public Internet via the HTTP protocol. All transferred data is formatted in XML.

With this service the platform administrator agrees with a partner to batch process the assignment of virtual numbers to large volumes of contacts at agreed predetermined times. Both parties define the structure of the input data to the platform as well as the output data produced by the platform including the virtual numbers assigned to the partner. After the platform completes processing the input data it is the responsibility of the partner to process the output file and to publish the appropriate virtual numbers e.g. on their web advertisements .

The transfer protocol used for the input and output files is ftp. It is the responsibility of both the platform administrator and the partner to provide secure ftp drop points with file integrity checks. The types of actions that may be input to the platform are as follows 

The platform can be configured to provide regular reporting to partners. For example once a month all the partners are provided with two standard reports that contain all revenue and call history details for the previous month. The reports are 

In broad summary the present invention provided a service for media owners running advertising in particular classified advertising from any visible media be it printed online or other. The fully automated service provides a dedicated pool of telephone numbers for the specific media outlet. When a customer places an advertisement within that media that advertisement can be allocated a telephone number from the media owner s pool for the lifetime of that advertisement. When called by a respondent the number automatically diverts to the advertiser s own telephone number s at no cost to the advertiser. Should the item be sold or the advert not renewed the number is withdrawn from use for a period before returning to the pool ready to be re issued to a new advertisement.

Incoming emails are then managed in accordance with the stored status associated with the virtual email address used the email routed to the advertiser if the status indicated that the item is available for sale or a return email being provided if the status indicates that the item is not available for sale.

Although preferred embodiments of the present invention are described above many changes modifications and substitutions may be made by one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

Each feature disclosed in the description the claims and drawings may be provided independently or in any appropriate combination.

All streams of data passed between the partner and the platform are XML compliant so any standard XML parser can be used. However unique additional requirements exist for those streams
