This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 765 325 filed on Feb. 15 2013 entitled MECHANISM FOR SERVICE LAYER RESOURCE PROPAGATION the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.

Machine to machine M2M technologies allow devices to communicate more directly with each other using wired and wireless communications systems. M2M technologies enable further realization of the Internet of Things IoT a system of uniquely identifiable objects and virtual representations of such objects that communicate with each other and over a network such as the Internet. IoT may facilitate communication with even mundane everyday objects such as products in a grocery store or appliances in a home and thereby reduce costs and waste by improving knowledge of such objects. For example stores may maintain very precise inventory data by being able to communicate with or obtain data from objects that may be in inventory or may have been sold.

An M2M entity e.g. an M2M functional entity such as device gateway server platform that may be implemented by hardware software or a combination of hardware and software may provide an application or service. For example a light sensor may provide data indicating detected light levels or a thermostat may provide temperature data and the ability to adjust air conditioning controls. This data may be made available as a resource that may be accessed by other M2M entities and that essentially serves as a means to exchange data between M2M entities. A resource may be a uniquely addressable representation of data that may be addressed using a Universal Resource Indicator URI . The availability of such resources may be communicated among M2M entities via the M2M service capabilities layer SCL using a mechanism called Announce that allows these entities to advertise and discover available resources in an M2M communication system. The M2M SCL is a functional entity that may be implemented by hardware and or software and that provides functions exposed on reference points i.e. functional interfaces between M2M entities . For example the M2M SCL may provide common service functionalities that are shared or commonly used by different M2M applications and or services. These common functionalities may be exposed using a set of open interfaces. For example M2M service capabilities may use cellular core network functionalities through a set of exposed interfaces e.g. existing interfaces specified by 3GPP 3GPP2 ETSI TISPAN etc. and may also interface to one or more other core networks. Because devices offering resources may be simple devices communications announcing a resource are often handled by a more intelligent device referred to as a hosting SCL entity that may be where the original resource resides. Like other M2M communications at the SCL resource announcements are made using logical communications interfaces at each entity called reference points that are independent of the physical communications interfaces and the actual communications path below the application layer between any communicating M2M entities.

M2M devices and entities are typically organized into M2M network domains. In many implementations an M2M server configured with a network SCL entity NSCL may maintain resources and resource data for use by other devices e.g. other M2M devices and M2M gateways in the same M2M network domain. However in current M2M implementations an SCL entity can only announce resources associated with an application registered with the SCL to other SCL entities in its own network domain. The announcement procedures currently in use are limited to announcing application resources by SCL entities may be referred to simply as SCLs rather than also allowing announcement of the SCLs and only facilitate announcements to the NSCL in the same network domain as the device announcing the resource.

Embodiments disclosed herein include methods for a machine to machine network node in one domain to generate a request to advertise a resource or a services capabilities layer entity in that domain and to transmit the request to another machine to machine network node in another domain via an inter domain reference point between the nodes.

Embodiments disclosed herein further include a machine to machine network node that executes instructions to effectuate operations including generating a request to advertise a resource in that node s domain and transmitting the request to another machine to machine network node in another domain via an inter domain reference point between the nodes.

Embodiments disclosed herein further include a computer readable medium having computer readable instructions stored thereon that when executed effectuate operations including generating a request to advertise a resource in a node s domain and transmitting the request to another machine to machine network node in another domain via an inter domain reference point between the nodes.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. Furthermore the claimed subject matter is not limited to limitations that solve any or all disadvantages noted in any part of this disclosure.

ETSI M2M TS 102 690 V2.0.12 herein ETSI M2M specification defines a mechanism called Announce that allows one service layer entity to advertise its resources to other entities thereby facilitating the use of resources by multiple entities. The instant disclosure may refer to this specification and or use terms as they are understood in this specification to aid in the understanding of the disclosed embodiments.

The embodiments set forth herein are described in terms of a representational state transfer REST architecture with components and entities described conforming to the constraints of a REST architecture RESTful architecture . A RESTful architecture is described in terms of the constraints applied to components entities connecters and data elements used in the architecture rather than in terms of physical component implementation or communications protocols used. Thus the roles and functions of the components entities connecters and data elements will be described. In a RESTful architecture representations of uniquely addressable resources are transferred between entities. The ETSI M2M specification has standardized the resource structure that resides on a SCL. When handling resources in a RESTful architecture there are basic methods that may be applied to resources such as Create create child resources Retrieve read the content of the resource Update write the content of the resource or Delete delete the resource. One skilled in the art will recognize that implementations of the instant embodiments may vary while remaining within the scope of the present disclosure. One skilled in the art will also recognize that the disclosed embodiments are not limited to implementations using the ETSI M2M architecture that is used herein to describe exemplary embodiments. The disclosed embodiments may be implemented in other architectures and systems such as oneM2M and other M2M systems and architectures.

As discussed above in the Background section in current M2M implementations an SCL entity can only announce resources associated with an application to other SCL entities in its own network domain. Moreover the announcement procedures currently in use are limited to announcing resources associated with an application may be referred to as simply a resource by SCL entities may be referred to simply as SCLs rather than also allowing announcement of resources representing the SCL may be referred to simply as an SCL resource and only facilitate announcements to the NSCL in the same network domain as the entity announcing the resource. Embodiments described hereinafter improve upon the existing announce mechanism enabling an SCL to announce an SCL resource and its subresources to other SCLs. For example an NSCL may advertise resources and SCL resources in the NSCL s domain to one or more other NSCLs in different domains. Alternatively other SCLs such as gateway SCLs GSCLs and device SCLs DSCLs may also advertise resources and SCL resources to one or more other SCLs in the same or in a different domain. This allows access to SCL resources and resources in one network domain by M2M entities in different network domains.

System may include M2M devices and entities in network domains and . NSCL may be in domain and configured with network application NA at M2

NSCL may be in domain with NA . NA and NSCL may communicate via mIa reference point . mIm reference point may be an inter domain reference point that allows M2M network nodes in different network domains such as NSCL in network domain and NSCL in network domain to communicate with one another. In embodiments of the methods and apparatus described hereinafter such inter domain communication may be used to announce resources and SCL resources across domains.

An SCL may announce a resource only to SCLs with which it has registered and that are able to accept the announcement request. In an embodiment procedures that are used to announce a resource to all potential Announced to SCLs may use one or both of the relevant mIa or dIa and the mId reference point. An Announced to SCL is an SCL containing an announced resource whose content may refer to the original resource hosted by a hosting SCL. The announced resource is an actual resource that may consist of only a limited set of attributes such as a link to the original resource hosted by another SCL a hosting SCL search strings and access rights. The announced resource facilitates a discovery of the original resource hosted by the hosting SCL so that the issuer of the discovery request does not have to contact all SCLs in order to find the original resource. If the original issuer of an announcement is an application such as GA DA or NA then the announcement may be triggered on the respective mIa or dIa reference point. For example dIa may be used to trigger an announcement for GA and dIa may be used to trigger an announcement for DA . The announcement may then be sent executed to NSCL using mId . If the original issuer of an announcement request is an SCL such as GSCL or DSCL then the announcement may be both triggered and executed on mId . Where the original issuer of an announcement request is an SCL such as GSCL or DSCL an application may request to be notified of the status of the announcement. Applications may use information announced to an SCL to access the resource. For example a link and or search strings for an announced application may be used by another application to communicate with the announced application.

In an embodiment where the issuer of an announcement request is an application e.g. NA GA DA the application may request to announce a resource to other SCLs by changing the appropriate attribute of the resource. The trigger to begin the announcement procedure may be the registration of the issuer with its local SCL. For example when GA registers with GSCL in network domain the registration may trigger the start of the process to announce the resources of GA . Alternatively the creation of a new resource on the local SCL such as the creation of a new resource for DA on DSCL in network domain or an update of a resource on the local SCL such as an update of a resource associated with NA on NSCL in network domain may trigger the start of the process to announce the resources of the respective application.

Announcement request may include one or more announce attributes provided in a list referred to as an announce attribute list where each attribute includes information regarding the scope of the announcement. Such attributes may include the type of announcement being requested. The attributes may further indicate that the issuer will determine the specific SCLs to which an announcement is to be made by listing those SCLs in the announce attribute list or announcement request or they may indicate that the local SCL is to make the determination of the SCLs to which the announcement is to be made. The attributes may further indicate whether the announce operation needs to be confirmed to the issuer. Announce operation confirmation may be used for all interface procedures or only a subset of such procedures. These attributes may further indicate whether announcement is enabled e.g. active or inactive . By using the inactive attribute the announce attribute list may be populated at the local SCL e.g. SCL but the announcement may not be made from the local SCL to other SCLs e.g. SCL . Use of the inactive attribute may only be allowed at resource creation and may be used to prevent an SCL from announcing the resource until an active attribute is received. In some embodiments once an announcement is indicated as active use of the inactive attribute may not be allowed or accepted.

The attribute list may be applicable to all announceable resources for which issuer may request creation or update on SCL . The attribute list that is provided by issuer at registration with SCL may be referred to as the issuer s default attribute list. Issuer s announceable resources may also provide their own respective attribute list in which case issuer s default attribute list may not be used for that particular resource. Updates or changes to the default attribute list by issuer are not propagated to previously created announceable resources on SCL but any new announceable resources of issuer may be requested using the updated default attribute list. To change attributes of an existing resource on SCL issuer may transmit an update to SCL for the resource that includes an updated attribute list.

SCL may validate received announcement request by determining that issuer is on a list of issuers authorized to announce resources. This list may be labeled accessRights . If not validated e.g. because issuer is not registered at SCL issuer is not authorized to create or update the requested resource on SCL or the attribute included in announcement request are not allowable SCL may not perform any of the announcement procedures and in some embodiments may return an error message to issuer . If validated at block SCL may create or update the resource representing an application e.g. NA GA or DA . If there are no attributes provided in announcement request SCL may use the current default attribute list for issuer in creating the new requested resource. A response may be transmitted to issuer via mIa or dIa reference point confirming that issuer is authorized to request the creation of resources on SCL . SCL may send this response prior to or after the completion of the announce procedure.

Note that in an embodiment where issuer is an application and does not indicate in announcement request the SCLs to which SCL should announce SCL sends response via mIa or dIa reference point to issuer prior to the completion of the announce procedure using mid reference point described below. In this embodiment SCL decides when and to which SCLs to announce the resource. In another embodiment wherein issuer is an application and announcement request indicates the SCLs to which SCL should announce the SCL sends response to issuer via mIa or dIa reference point after it has completed announcing the resource to all the indicated SCLs. In this embodiment response may indicate to issuer the status of the announced resources i.e. whether the resource was successfully created at each of the indicated SCLs . In this embodiment response may include a list of the SCLs that were announced to successfully.

In another embodiment announcement request may indicate that no confirmation is required and therefore in this embodiment response may not be sent. In other embodiments where announcement request is an Update request rather than a Create request and where an indication that no confirmation is required is included in announcement request response is not sent but when announcement request is a Create request response is transmitted regardless.

In response to determining that announcement request is valid SCL may continue announce procedure processing at block and determine when and to which SCLs to announce the newly created or updated resource.

Announce resource request may be transmitted via reference point mId to Announced to SCL . Announce resource request may be referred to simply as an Announce and may be a Create request requesting the creation of a resource. Announce may include search strings and a link to the created resource.

Announced to SCL may validate Announce in an embodiment similarly to the process used by SCL to validate announcement request but other embodiments using alternate methods of validation are contemplated as within the scope of the present disclosure. In an embodiment creation of the resource may only be allowed if SCL is included in Announced to SCL s accessRight list of entities authorized to announce resources to Announced to SCL .

At block Announced to SCL may attempt to create the requested resource for example an announced resource that represents an active announcement of the application NA GA or DA with the specified attributes if SCL has successfully been validated. If Announced to SCL determines that SCL is permitted to announce resources to Announced to SCL Announced to SCL will proceed with generating and populating memory space to contain announced resource data and taking any other steps needed to prepare for and conduct announcement of the resource.

Upon completion of the processing at block Announced to SCL may transmit response that may indicate whether the creation of the announced resource was successful or unsuccessful. If the announced resource was not created at Announced to SCL e.g. because SCL is not registered at Announced to SCL SCL is not authorized to create the requested resource on Announced to SCL or the attribute s included in request are not allowable SCL may not perform any of the announcement procedures and in some embodiments may return an error message to issuer . If creation of the announced resource at Announced to SCL was successful response includes an identifier e.g. a uniform resource identifier URI of the announced resource.

Note that SCL may also send Announce to other SCLs as well and therefore the steps within dashed box may be repeated until the resource is announced to all SCL to which SCL has determined it should be announced. Unless specified in the announce attribute list included in announcement request SCL may determine to which SCLs the resource should be announced. SCL may also provide the corresponding expiration time for the resource.

As an improvement over the existing M2M announce processes in an embodiment and referring again to NSCL may be configured to announce SCL resources including announceable subresources. Based on an announce attribute list received from another SCL e.g. GSCL DSCL or from an application e.g. NA GA DA NSCL may announce a resource to an Announced to NSCL such as NSCL in domain via mIm reference point by sending an announcement e.g. Create request over mIm reference point . If the resource is hosted by NSCL e.g. a resource originating at NA NSCL may create the announced resource and send an announce resource request to the NSCL that includes the announced resource containing for example a search strings and the link to the original resource. If the resource has been announced to NSCL by another SCL e.g. GSCL DSCL the resource is an announced resource at NSCL and NSCL may announce it to NSCL according to the list of specific SCLs to which an announcement is to be made that was included in the attribute list that accompanied the request to create the resource received by NSCL . Note that this attribute or list may be referred to as an announceTo attribute of the resource.

The ETSI M2M specification defines an resource that represents a remote SCL that is registered at the SCL storing the resource. This specification further defines a that is a root resource that included all resources may be referred to as subresources that reside and are available at an SCL storing the resource including a collection resource i.e. a resource that represents zero or more other resources scls that contains all resources representing all SCLs registered on the SCL or that the SCL is registered to on which the resource is located i.e. all SCLs registered at the SCL storing the resource . Thus each remote SCL that is registered with an SCL s is represented by an resource in that SCL s resource. Likewise each registered to SCL is also represented as a sub set resource in the registering SCL s . For example referring again to and using ETSI resource notation when GSCL registers with NSCL there are two resources created one in GSCL a scls resource and one in NSCL a scls resource.

As an improvement to the existing M2M announce procedures in an embodiment also included under the resource may be a collection resource representing a set of resources that each represent an announced SCL and its subresources available which may be in a different network domain from that of the entity on which the collection resource is located. This collection resource may be referred to as sclAnncs in some embodiments. An example of this collection resource is shown as sclAnncs under resource of . Also among attributes may be an announceTo attribute that is a list of the SCLs to which an announcement of this resource should be made. The SCL on which the resource is configured will attempt to announce resources to the SCLs in the announceTo list. As noted above if a list of entities to which to announce resources is not provided in an announcement request received over the mIa or dIa reference point the local SCL will decide where the resource will be announced. Also among attributes may be a registeredScls attribute that is a list of SCLs that are registered with the SCL configured with the resource . For example in if GSCL registers with NSCL configured with the resource then GSCL is an element of the registeredScls of NSCL . 

sclAnncs resource may include zero or more subresources e.g. resources of the SCL that each may be referred to as an resource. Each resource an announced SCL resource represents an active announcement of an SCL. The SCL may be a registered SCL in a different network domain from that of the SCL on which sclAnncs resource is configured. The resource is used for announcement of an SCL resource from an SCL to other SCLs in some embodiments over the mIm reference point.

Attributes of sclAnncs resource may also include a creationTime attribute that indicates the time of creation of sclAnncs resource . Attributes of sclAnncs resource may further include a lastModifiedTime attribute that indicates the time of the most recent update or modification of sclAnncs resource . sclAnncs resource may also include subscriptions that may indicate whether sclAnncs resource may be subscribed to.

sclAnncs resource may also include zero or more subresources 410 that each represent an active announcement of a remote SCL which may be in a different network domain that are announced to the SCL on which sclAnncs resource is configured.

 resource may contain attributes and zero or more subresources containers that may contain resources groups that may contain resources applications that may contain resources that may represent an active announcement of a registered application in another SCL and that may maintain a link to the original resource and accessRights that may contain resources each of which may be a collection resource. Each of these subresources may have a lifetime and scope that are linked to resource . For example each resource created as a descendant of announced resource may be automatically deleted when the SCL associated with resource is deannounced or when the announcement of the SCL expires. The announcing SCL may keep the accessRightID and any searchStrings tokens used as keys for discovering resources associated with the resource synchronized with the resource that is announced.

Containers may contain zero or more representations of resources each of which represent a container located at the SCL represented by the resource under which resource and resource s parent sclAnncs resource are located. Groups may contain zero or more representations of resources each of which may represent a group resource located at the SCL represented by the resource under which resource and resource s parent sclAnncs resource are located. Applications may contain zero or more representations of resources each of which may represent an active application located at the SCL represented by the resource under which resource and resource s parent sclAnncs resource are located. AccessRights may contain zero or more representations of resources each of which may represent an resource in another SCL and include a link to the original resource. The represented SCLs may be entities that are permitted to access the SCL represented by the resource under which resource and resource s parent sclAnncs resource are located.

Attributes may include a link attribute that is a link that references the resource that is announced and associated with resource . This link may be the reference provided during the discovery process. Attributes may also include an accessRightID attribute that indicates the URI of an access rights resource as described herein. Attributes may also include an announceTo attribute that may be a list of the SCLs to which the associated resource should be announced as described herein. Attributes may also include a searchStrings attribute providing token that may be used as keys for discovering resources. Attributes may further include an expirationTime attribute that defines a time in some embodiments an absolute time after which resource will be deleted by the SCL on which it is hosted.

Using ETSI notation and referring again to where GSCL is announced to NSCL by NSCL the announcement of GSCL i.e. as an announced SCL resource representing an active announcement of GSCL resource may be represented as scls sclAnncs .

In an embodiment referring to Announces may be sent over mIm to NSCL by NSCL that announce SCLs and application resources. Such Announces may be made using the sclAnncs collection resource and resources representing active announcements of the SCLs and subresources. When NSCL and NSCL register with one another an resource is created on each e.g. scls is created at NSCL and scls is created at NSCL . The announced SCLs may be stored under the resource created after registration. For example upon NSCL registering with NSCL GSCL which is registered to NSCL may be announced to NSCL over mIm reference point if GSCL indicated that it may be announced to any SCLs or at least to NSCL . Using ETSI notation the announced GSCL resource i.e. a representation of an active announcement of GSCL resource may be stored under scls sclAnncs as scls sclAnncs . Once announced to NSCL the announced GSCL resource may be available to entities in domain .

An announcing NSCL such as NSCL may announce the same resource to multiple other NSCLs such as NSCL in network domain and NSCL in network domain . Once announced to the NSCLs the announced resource may be available to entities in domains and as well as or instead of entities in domain . Unless specified in the announce attribute list NSCL may decide to which SCLs to announce to. For resources hosted on NSCL NSCL may also provide an expiration time. For resources announced to NSCL i.e. not hosted on NSCL NSCL may use the expiration time received in the corresponding resource s Announce as an attribute.

In an embodiment Announced to NSCL may receive an announcement of an SCL resource from NSCL and create the announced SCL resource e.g. with the specified attributes. Creation may be permitted announcing that NSCL is authorized to create a child resource according to the accessRight defined for the resource. If the creation is successful Announced to NSCL may return a response indicating success to NSCL that may include an identifier e.g. a URI of the created announced SCL resource. If the creation is not successful NSCL may return an error message to NSCL .

Announcement request may include an announce attribute list that includes one or more of any of the announce attributes as described herein such as those described for attributes and of respectively. The announce attribute list may be applicable to all announceable resources for which issuer may request creation on NSCL . The announce attribute list that is provided by issuer at registration with NSCL may be referred to as the issuer s default announce attribute list. Issuer s announceable resources may also provide their own announce attribute list in which case issuer s default announce attribute list may not be used for that particular resource. Updates or changes to the default announce attribute list by issuer are not propagated to previously created announceable resources on NSCL but any new announceable resources of issuer may be requested using the updated default announce attribute list. To change attributes of an existing resource on NSCL issuer may transmit an update to SCL for the resource that includes an updated announce attribute list.

NSCL may validate received announcement request using methods described herein for example by determining that issuer is on an accessRights list. If not validated e.g. because issuer is not registered at NSCL issuer is not authorized to create or update the requested resource on NSCL or the attributes included in announcement request are not allowable NSCL may not perform any of the announcement procedures and in some embodiments may return an error message to issuer . If validated at block NSCL may create or update the resource. If there are no attributes provided in announcement request NSCL may use the current default announce attribute list for issuer in creating the new requested resource. Response may be transmitted to issuer via mIa or dIa reference point . Response may confirm that issuer is authorized to request the creation or update of resources on NSCL . NSCL may send this response prior to or after the completion of the announce procedure.

Note that in an embodiment where issuer does not indicate in announcement request the SCLs to which NSCL should announce NSCL sends response to issuer prior to the completion of the announce procedure described below. In this embodiment NSCL decides when and to which SCLs to announce the resource. In another embodiment wherein announcement request indicates the SCLs to which NSCL should announce NSCL sends response to issuer via the mIa or dIa reference point after it has completed announcing the resource to all the indicated SCLs. In this embodiment response may indicate to issuer the status of the announced resources i.e. whether the resource was successfully created at each of the indicated SCLs . In this embodiment response may include a list of the SCLs that were announced to successfully.

In another embodiment announcement request may indicate that no confirmation is required and therefore in this embodiment response may not be sent. In other embodiments where announcement request is an Update request rather than a Create request and where an indication that no confirmation is required is included in announcement request response is not sent but when announcement request is a Create request response is transmitted regardless.

In response to determining that announcement request is valid NSCL may continue announce procedure processing at block and determine when and to which SCLs to announce the newly created or updated resource that is to be announced by the issuer .

Announce may be transmitted via reference point mIm to Announced to NSCL in a different domain Domain 2 from that of NSCL Domain 1 . Announce may be a Create request requesting the creation of an announced resource that represents an active announcement of a resource to be announced by the issuer . Announce requests that Announced to NSCL create the announced resource that may include search strings and a link to the original resource as described herein.

Announced to NSCL may validate Announce in an embodiment similarly to the process used by NSCL to validate announcement request but other embodiments using alternate methods of validation are contemplated as within the scope of the present disclosure. In an embodiment creation of the resource may only be allowed if NSCL is included in Announced to NSCL s accessRight list of entities authorized to announce resources to Announced to NSCL .

At block Announced to NSCL may attempt to create the requested resource with the specified attributes if NSCL has successfully been validated.

Upon completion of the processing at block Announced to NSCL may transmit response that may indicate whether the creation of the announced resource was successful or unsuccessful. If the announced resource was not created at Announced to NSCL e.g. because NSCL is not registered at Announced to NSCL NSCL is not authorized to create the requested resource on Announced to NSCL or the attribute included in request are not allowable NSCL may not perform any of the announcement procedures and in some embodiments may return an error message to issuer in response . If creation of the resource at Announced to NSCL was successful response may include an identifier e.g. a uniform resource identifier URI of the resource.

Note that NSCL may also send Announce to other NSCLs as well and therefore the steps within dashed box may be repeated until the resource required to be announced in announcement request is announced to all NSCLs to which NSCL has determined it should be announced. Unless specified in the announce attribute list included in announcement request NSCL may determine to which SCLs the resource should be announced. NSCL may also provide the corresponding expiration time for the resource.

Announcement request may include an announce attribute list that includes one or more of any of the announce attributes as described herein such as those described for attributes and of respectively. The announce attribute list may be applicable to all announcements of SCL issuer announced by NSCL . Issuer may provide its own announce attribute list. Updates or changes to the announce attribute list by issuer may not be automatically propagated NSCL but such changes may be provided to NSCL by the transmission of an update to SCL that include an updated announce attribute list.

NSCL may validate received announcement request using methods described herein for example by determining that issuer is on an accessRights list. If not validated e.g. because issuer is not registered at NSCL issuer is not authorized to create the requested SCL on NSCL or the attributes included in announcement request are not allowable NSCL may not perform any of the announcement procedures and in some embodiments may return an error message to issuer . If validated at block NSCL may create or update the SCL resource e.g. DSCL resource or GSCL resource stored at NSCL . If there are no attributes provided in announcement request NSCL may use the current default announce attribute list for issuer in creating the new requested SCL. Response may be transmitted to issuer via mId reference point . Response may confirm that issuer is authorized to request the creation or update of the SCL on NSCL . NSCL may send this response prior to or after the completion of the announce procedure.

Note that in an embodiment where issuer does not indicate in announcement request the SCLs to which NSCL should announce NSCL sends response to issuer via the mId reference point prior to the completion of the announce procedure on mIm reference point described below. In this embodiment NSCL decides when and to which SCLs to announce the resource. In another embodiment wherein issuer indicates the SCLs to which NSCL should announce NSCL sends response to issuer via mId reference point after it has completed announcing the SCL to all the indicated SCLs. In this embodiment response may indicate to issuer the status of the SCL resource required to be announced i.e. whether the SCL resource was successfully created at each of the indicated SCLs . In this embodiment response may include a list of the SCLs i.e. the list of Announced to SCLs that were announced to successfully. In another embodiment announcement request may indicate that no confirmation is required and therefore in this embodiment response may not be sent. In other embodiments where announcement request is an Update request rather than a Create request and where an indication that no confirmation is required is included in announcement request response is not sent but when announcement request is a Create request response is transmitted regardless.

In response to determining that announcement request is valid NSCL may continue announce procedure processing at block and determine when and to which SCLs to announce the newly created or updated resource.

Announce may be transmitted via reference point mIm to Announced to NSCL in a different domain Domain 2 from that of NSCL Domain 1 . Announce may be a Create request to create an announced SCL resource at Announced to NSCL which may represent an active announcement of the SCL resource e.g. DSCL or GSCL required to be announced by the issuer . The announced SCL resource may be configured with an resource as shown in and may include a link to the original resource as well as an expiration time accessRight information and or search strings as described herein.

Announced to NSCL may validate Announce in an embodiment similarly to the process used by NSCL to validate announcement request but other embodiments using alternate methods of validation are contemplated as within the scope of the present disclosure. In an embodiment creation of the announced SCL resource may only be allowed if NSCL is included in Announced to NSCL s accessRight list of entities authorized to announce SCLs to Announced to NSCL .

At block Announced to NSCL may attempt to create the requested announced SCL resource with the specified attributes if NSCL has successfully been validated. Such attributes and other data configured for the resource by Announced to NSCL may include data provided in Announce such as a link to the original resource an expiration time accessRight information and or search strings.

Upon completion of the processing at block Announced to NSCL may transmit response that may indicate whether the creation of the announced SCL resource was successful or unsuccessful. If the announced SCL resource was not successfully created at Announced to NSCL e.g. because NSCL is not registered at Announced to NSCL NSCL is not authorized to create the announced SCL resource on Announced to NSCL or the attributes included in request are not allowable NSCL may not perform any of the announcement procedures and in some embodiments may return an error message to issuer . If creation of the announced SCL resource at Announced to NSCL was successful response includes an identifier e.g. a uniform resource identifier URI of the announced SCL. If the creation is not successful response may be an error message.

Note that NSCL may also send Announce to other NSCLs as well and therefore the steps within dashed box may be repeated until the SCL resource required to be announced by issuer is announced to all NSCLs to which NSCL has determined it should be announced. In the example embodiment described in regard to an SCL resource is announced from one NSCL to another NSCL over the mIm reference point. However in other embodiments a similar SCL resource announcement mechanism utilizing the resource configuration see e.g. may be used where SCL resources are announced between other types of SCLs such as between GSCLs DSCLs or between any combination of different types of SCLs. Unless specified in the announce attribute list included in announcement request NSCL may determine to which SCLs the SCL resource should be announced. NSCL may also provide the corresponding expiration time for the resource.

In response to detecting the trigger NSCL may generate Update request and send request to Announced to NSCL in Domain 2 via mIm reference point . Note that in some embodiments only the Announcing NSCL that originally announced the resource may be permitted to update the announced resource.

Upon receipt of request Announced to NSCL may validate the received request using any method or means set forth herein and may then upon successful validation update the announced resource at block with the attributes specified in request . If the update of the announced resource succeeded NSCL may transmit response indicating a successful update of the announced SCL resource to NSCL via mIm reference point . Otherwise NSCL may transmit response indicating the update of the resource was not successful to NSCL via mIm reference point .

In some embodiments a resource may need to be removed from one or more SCLs or deannounced . illustrates a signal flow of an embodiment of a resource deannouncement procedure for deannouncing a previously announced resource across domains that may use the structures and elements of such structures as described above in regard to . Note that the exemplary embodiments described in regard to may be used to deannounce any type of resource including SCL resources. As a result of expiration of a resource i.e. the time provided in the resource s expirationTime attribute has arrived because a resource was deleted or as a result of a change to an announce attribute list for a resource received in Update request from Issuer received over any of the mId dIa or mIa reference points i.e. removal of an SCL that was previously to be announced to NSCL in Domain 1 may determine that a resource is to be deannounced. In another embodiment deannouncement request may be a resource Delete request received from issuer . NSCL may validate deannouncement request using any means or method set forth herein or otherwise.

If deannouncement request is not successfully validated NSCL may send response to Issuer informing issuer that deannouncement request was not validated. This may take the form of an error message. If deannouncement request is successfully validated Announcing NSCL may delete the resource at block if the resource is to be deleted from NSCL . Alternatively where the resource is only to be deleted from or no longer announced by a subset of SCLs NSCL may transmit denouncement requests to such SCLs. Announcing NSCL may also or instead update the announce attribute list for the resource at block for example by updating the announce attribute list of the resource required to be deannounced. Response may be sent to Issuer confirming that Issuer is authorized to perform the deannouncement actions requested in deannouncement request . Note that response may be sent prior to the completion of the deannounce procedure or after the deannounce procedure is complete.

At block NSCL may determine the SCLs i.e. Announced to SCLs to which the resource is to be deannounced and transmit Deannounce via reference point mIm to Announced to NSCL which may be in a different domain Domain 2 from that of NSCL Domain 1 . Deannounce may be a Delete request requesting the deletion of an announced in some embodiments SCL resource based on a Delete request in deannouncement request or an Update request in request that removes Announced to NSCL from the announce attribute list of the resource required to be deannounced.

Announced to NSCL may validate Deannounce using any means or methods disclosed herein or otherwise. At block Announced to NSCL may attempt to delete the resource if Deannounce has successfully been validated.

Upon completion of the processing at block Announced to NSCL may transmit response that may indicate whether the deletion of the resource was successful or unsuccessful. If the resource was not successfully deleted from Announced to NSCL e.g. because NSCL is not registered at Announced to NSCL NSCL is not authorized to delete the requested resource on Announced to NSCL or the attributes included in request are not allowable NSCL may not delete the resource and may return response containing an error message to NSCL . If deletion of the resource at Announced to NSCL was successful response may confirm successful deletion of the resource to NSCL .

Note that NSCL may also send Deannounce to other NSCLs as well and therefore the steps within dashed box may be repeated until the resource is deannounced to all NSCLs to which NSCL has determined it should be deannounced. In the example embodiment described in regard to a resource SCL or otherwise is deannounced between two NSCLs using the mIm reference point. However in other embodiments a similar resource deannouncement mechanism utilizing the resource configuration see e.g. may be used where SCL resources are deannounced between other types of SCLs such as between GSCLs DSCLs or between any combination of different types of SCLs.

At block GSCL registers to NSCL . In response NSCL creates an resource representing registered GSCL under scls i.e. scls . Upon registration GSCL may indicate that it may be announced by NSCL to any other SCLs. Alternatively GSCL may indicate specific SCLs to which NSCL may announce GSCL .

At block NSCL may determine when and to which SCLs to announce GSCL and such announcements may be transmitted over an mIm interface. After NSCL sends the announcement of GSCL to NSCL at block NSCL may create an announced SCL resource configured with an resource that represents an active announcement of the GSCL resource under scls in the resource tree of NSCL i.e. scls sclAnnces . The resource may contain a link to the URI of the GSCL resource stored at NSCL . Thus GSCL is now discoverable to SCLs and applications in domain .

When GSCL announced DA to NSCL at block NSCL created an announced resource representing an active announcement of DA under scls applications to represent the announced resource of DA at NSCL i.e. scls applications . At block NSCL announces GSCL to NSCL for example as demonstrated in . Because there are applications registered to GSCL NSCL may announce those applications registered to GSCL to NSCL . DA is an example of one such application. At block NSCL sends an Announce request to NSCL requesting that NSCL announce DA . At block NSCL creates the announced resource of DA under scls sclAnncs applications i.e. scls sclAnncs applications . Upon completion of this step at block DA originally only visible at GSCL as an application behind a gateway is made visible at NSCL and then at NSCL in domain . Thus DA becomes discoverable for SCLs and applications in in domain .

Under block representing the SCL resource may be application branch a collection resource of application resources. Under application branch may be block that may be the resource an announced resource representing an active announcement of the DA resource. This resource may include a link to the original resource such as Applications .
