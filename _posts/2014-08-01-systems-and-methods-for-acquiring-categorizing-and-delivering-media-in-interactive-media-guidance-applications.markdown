This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 641 987 filed Dec. 18 2006 currently allowed which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 849 988 filed Oct. 6 2006 which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.

This invention relates generally to media guidance applications and in particular to providing guidance for media obtained from the Internet.

The Internet is an increasingly popular resource for obtaining entertainment media and information. There are an incredible number of sources on the Internet that provide various types of media such as downloadable television episodes and movies or streaming television previews and movie trailers. Furthermore nearly all of the media and related information on the Internet is available on demand. Therefore users may be confident that media of interest is always available.

The abundance of online media and media providers however also creates difficulty in terms of locating media of interest. To locate particular online media content without guidance a user may need to know a significant amount of information about the media. For example if a user wants to find media related to a particular episode of a television show the user may need to go directly to the media provider which in this case is the website of the television network. Then the user may need to know the original air date of the episode or the title of the episode in order to effectively locate media on the network website. Not only is this process inconvenient for the user it provides no help for those who are not searching for a particular media. Thus guidance for Internet delivered media content is necessary to enable or aid a user to easily and effectively locate media of interest.

Some forms of guidance for media content provided on the Internet are already available. Many guidance applications for online media are limited to keyword searching and providing listings of featured media. Neither of these techniques provide effective or systematic means for narrowing down the extremely large amount of media that is available on the Internet. Thus users of existing guidance applications are often bombarded with an overabundance of listings many of which may be uninteresting or irrelevant. Therefore there is a need for a guidance application that not only provides keyword searching and displays featured online media but also provides a systematic method for narrowing down the available online media to a reasonably small set of media that interests the user.

The media listings generated by existing guidance applications are often not conducive for browsing. Video searches may yield results that are cluttered unorganized difficult to navigate or unfocused. Different types of videos may be presented in similar formats making them virtually indistinguishable. For example professionally generated media content may be displayed in a similar format as user generated media content and high quality media content may displayed in a similar format as lower quality media content. Therefore users may need to spend a significant amount of time going through each media listing. Thus there is a need for an online media guidance application that enables users to quickly browse through a set of online media listings.

Furthermore many existing guidance applications only provide guidance for a limited set of videos on the Internet. The limited set may therefore not include available online media that a user is interested in. Some guidance applications are limited because they only provide guidance for media content that they host. Other applications that obtain media from third party sites rely on partnerships with media providers which again results in a very limited media data set. Therefore there is need for a guidance application that provides guidance for a comprehensive set of online media content.

Accordingly systems and methods are provided for identifying and obtaining information for a set of media provided on the Internet and displaying a subset of the identified media in a listing. Systems and methods are also provided that systematically narrow down a set of online media listings provided to a user based on criteria that interests the user.

In accordance with one principle of the invention an online media guidance application provides selectable criteria elements e.g. action adventure comedy ABC Comedy Central etc. in a user interface. By receiving one or more selections of the selectable criteria elements a set of available online videos may be systematically narrowed down to a reasonably sized set of videos that interest the user. The selectable criteria elements may be organized into categories e.g. genre channels shows . The categories may also be displayed in the user interface and the corresponding selectable criteria elements may be presented in a window near or below the corresponding category. To keep the user interface from being cluttered the criteria elements of one category may be visible at a given time. When a user selects a different category the currently presented window of criteria elements may be closed and a new window of selectable criteria elements corresponding to the selected category is presented.

When a user selection of a criteria element is received by the media guidance application a set of videos is identified based on the selected criteria element and any previously selected criteria elements. In some embodiments the set of identified media may include available media that meet all of the selected criteria elements. In other embodiments the set of identified media may include available media that meet one or more of the selected criteria elements. The set of media may be displayed in a listing such as in a video mosaic or a textual listing. In some embodiments each listing is displayed within a selectable frame and upon receiving user selection of a frame the guidance application directs the user to the website of the corresponding media provider.

In some embodiments of the present invention after narrowing down the number of listings the displayed criteria elements may also change to reflect the new set of identified videos. For instance when a new window of selectable criteria elements is presented criteria elements may be displayed in the window only if selecting the criteria element would produce at least one video in the redefined set. In some cases a criteria element may be displayed in the window if there are videos in the identified set of videos that meet the criteria element and all previously selected criteria elements.

In accordance with another principle of the present invention the set of online media that the guidance application provides guidance for is determined by crawling through a plurality of websites and obtaining information on media provided by each website. The obtained information may include metadata e.g. title runtime description etc. corresponding to each video.

For each video obtained from the Internet the media guidance application associates video metadata with media guidance application data from for example a media guidance application database. Associations may be determined by comparing the video metadata with guidance data in the guidance application database. A subset of the available online videos may be selected based on the scope narrowing mechanism described above keyword searches user personalization data or editor s preference designations. The selected online videos may be displayed in a media listing such as in a video mosaic or a textual listing. Included in the listing for each video is the associated guidance application data from the guidance application database.

The amount of media available to users in any given media delivery system can be substantial. Consequently many users desire a form of media guidance through an interface that allows users to efficiently navigate media selections and easily identify media that they may desire. An application which provides such guidance is referred to herein as an interactive media guidance application or sometimes a media guidance application or a guidance application. Similarly a media guidance application that provides guidance for Internet content and possibly other types of content is referred to herein as an online media guidance application or online guidance application.

Various forms of interactive media guidance applications may provide guidance for media content on the Internet e.g. streaming media downloadable media Webcasts etc. . One typical type of media guidance application that provides guidance for online media is an interactive television program guide. Interactive television program guides sometimes referred to as electronic program guides are well known guidance applications that among other things allow users to navigate among and locate many types of media content. Other than online media such content may include conventional television programming provided via traditional broadcast cable satellite or other means as well as pay per view programs on demand programs as in video on demand VOD systems and other types of media or video content. Guidance applications also allow users to navigate among and locate content related to the video content including for example video clips articles advertisements chat sessions games etc.

With the advent of the Internet mobile computing and high speed wireless networks users are accessing media on personal computers PCs and other devices on which they traditionally did not such as hand held computers personal digital assistants PDAs mobile telephones or other mobile devices. On these devices users are able to navigate among and locate the same media available through a television. Consequently media guidance is necessary on these devices as well. The guidance provided may be for media content available only through a television for media content available only through one or more of these devices or for media content available both through a television and one or more of these devices. The media guidance applications may be provided as online applications i.e. provided on a web site or as stand alone applications or clients on hand held computers PDAs mobile telephones or other mobile devices. The various devices and platforms that may implement media guidance applications are described in more detail below.

One of the functions of the media guidance application is to provide media listings and media information to users. show illustrative display screens that may be used to provide media guidance and in particular media listings. The display screens shown in may be implemented on any suitable device or platform. While the displays of and are illustrated as full screen displays they may also be fully or partially overlaid over media content being displayed. A user may indicate a desire to access media information by selecting a selectable option provided in a display screen e.g. a menu option a listings option an icon a hyperlink etc. or pressing a dedicated button e.g. a GUIDE button on a remote control or other user input interface or device. In response to the user s indication the media guidance application may provide a display screen with media information organized in one of several ways such as by time and channel in a grid by time by channel by media type by category e.g. movies sports news children or other categories of programming or other predefined user defined or other organization criteria.

In addition to providing access to linear programming provided according to a schedule the media guidance application also provides access to non linear programming which is not provided according to a schedule. Non linear programming may include content from different media sources including Internet content e.g. streaming media downloadable media etc. from various online sources on demand media content e.g. VOD locally stored media content e.g. video content stored on a digital video recorder DVR digital video disc DVD video cassette compact disc CD etc. or other time insensitive media content. On demand content may include both movies and original media content provided by a particular media provider e.g. HBO On Demand providing The Sopranos and Curb Your Enthusiasm . HBO ON DEMAND THE SOPRANOS and CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM are trademarks owned by the Home Box Office Inc. Internet content may include web events such as a chat session or Webcast or content available on demand as streaming media or downloadable media through an Internet web site or other Internet access e.g. FTP .

Grid may provide listings for non linear programming including on demand listing recorded media listing and Internet content listing . A display combining listings for content from different types of media sources is sometimes referred to as a mixed media display. The various permutations of the types of listings that may be displayed that are different than display may be based on user selection or guidance application definition e.g. a display of only recorded and broadcast listings only on demand and broadcast listings etc. . As illustrated listings and are shown as spanning the entire time block displayed in grid to indicate that selection of these listings may provide access to a display dedicated to on demand listings recorded listings or Internet listings respectively. As shown in information region may display information on the type of display that may be provided when accessing such a listing. In other embodiments listings for these media types may be included directly in grid . Additional listings may be displayed in response to the user selecting one of the navigational icons . Pressing an arrow key on a user input device may affect the display in a similar manner as selecting navigational icons . 

Display may also include video region advertisement and options region . Video region may allow the user to view and or preview programs that are currently available will be available or were available to the user. The content of video region may correspond to or be independent from one of the listings displayed in grid . Grid displays including a video region are sometimes referred to as picture in guide PIG displays. PIG displays and their functionalities are described in greater detail in Satterfield et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 564 378 issued May 13 2003 and Yuen et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 239 794 issued May 29 2001 which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. PIG displays may be included in other media guidance application display screens of the present invention.

Advertisement may provide an advertisement for media content that depending on a viewer s access rights e.g. for subscription programming is currently available for viewing will be available for viewing in the future or may never become available for viewing and may correspond to or be unrelated to one or more of the media listings in grid . Advertisement may also be for products or services related or unrelated to the media content displayed in grid . Advertisement may be selectable and provide further information about media content provide information about a product or a service enable purchasing of media content a product or a service provide media content relating to the advertisement etc. Advertisement may be targeted based on a user s profile preferences monitored user activity the type of display provided or on other suitable targeted advertisement bases.

While advertisement is shown as rectangular or banner shaped advertisements may be provided in any suitable size shape and location in a guidance application display. For example advertisement may be provided as a rectangular shape that is horizontally adjacent to grid . This is sometimes referred to as a panel advertisement. In addition advertisements may be overlaid over media content or a guidance application display or embedded within a display. Advertisements may also include text images rotating images video clips or other types of media content. Advertisements may be stored in the user equipment with the guidance application in a database connected to the user equipment in a remote location including streaming media servers or on other storage means or a combination of these locations. Providing advertisements in a media guidance application is discussed in greater detail in for example Knudson et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 347 673 filed Jan. 17 2003 Ward III et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 756 997 issued Jun. 29 2004 and Schein et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 388 714 issued May 14 2002 which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. It will be appreciated that advertisements may be included in other media guidance application display screens of the present invention.

Options region may allow the user to access different types of media content e.g. Internet content media guidance application displays and or media guidance application features. Options region may be part of display and other display screens of the present invention or may be invoked by a user by selecting an on screen option or pressing a dedicated or assignable button on a user input device. The selectable options within options region may concern features related to program listings in grid or may include options available from a main menu display. Features related to program listings may include searching for other air times or ways of receiving a program recording a program enabling series recording of a program setting program and or channel as a favorite purchasing a program or other features. Options available from a main menu display may include search options VOD options parental control options access to various types of listing displays subscribe to a premium service edit a user s profile access a browse overlay or other options.

Another display arrangement for providing guidance is shown in . Display provides guidance for Internet delivered videos and may be provided as a display in an online media guidance application or as a display in a client server or stand alone e.g. set top box based guidance application. In some examples herein Internet delivered television programs are provided although the disclosed embodiments may provide guidance for movies user generated content or any other types of media content. In some embodiments display is displayed a result of user selection of listing in display . For clarity and organization display may be split into three columns. Center column contains media listings arranged in mosaic . Left column allows a user to define criteria e.g. a particular genre show etc. for the videos provided in mosaic . Right column provides recommendations to the user. Each of these columns will be discussed in more detail below in connection with A C and A B.

Left column allows a user to select videos based on criteria of interest. Left column provides a list of selectable categories . The categories may include genre channels shows hotlists type e.g. television episode movies etc. or any other such category. One of the categories may be in a selected state. The category may be selected based on user indication or may default to being selected. In the selected state there may be a window of selectable criteria elements corresponding to the selected category. The window may be situated under the name of the category to indicate which category is selected. With a user input device a user may select a criteria element in window e.g. by moving highlighted region to a desired criteria element and pressing a key or by directly clicking the desired criteria element . Once selected in addition to being displayed within window the selected criteria element may appear at . That is it may appear below its corresponding category and above window . This indicates to the user that the criteria element has been successfully selected. When multiple criteria elements are selected within the same category each criteria element may be listed below the category in some order e.g. in the order the criteria elements were selected in alphabetical order etc. . A selected criteria element may be listed below its corresponding category even when the category is not selected as indicated by selected criteria element . Selectable buttons may be provided next to each selected criteria element and . Selecting button may deselect the corresponding selected criteria element.

An alternative way for a user to select criteria elements is to manually enter search terms keywords. A user may enter one or more keywords into search bar using a user input device. Selectable button may be selected to initiate a search using the entered keywords. Search bar may be used in conjunction with left column if desired e.g. a user may define criteria elements based on selected criteria elements in column and keywords entered into search bar .

Center column may display a set of videos in mosaic where the set of videos is determined based on receiving user input of search bar and or left column . Unlike the listings from the listings in display are not limited to simple text e.g. the program title and icons to describe media. Rather in display the listings may provide graphical images including cover art still images from the media content video clip previews live video from the media content or other types of media that indicate to a user the media content being described by the listing. Each of the graphical listings may also be accompanied by text to provide further information about the media content associated with the listing. To avoid over complicating the figure a more detailed view of a listing in mosaic is shown in .

Returning to the number of total identified videos after applying selected or entered criteria is shown in region . Region is shown to be in left column but may be displayed anywhere on user interface . If more videos are identified than those currently visible in mosaic selectable arrows and may be used to view more available videos. Selectable arrow allows a user to view a new subset of identified videos and selectable arrow returns the user to the previously viewed subset of identified videos. The user may change the order in which the videos are presented by selecting one of sort links . The identified videos may be sorted according to the date that the video became available e.g. most recent first or oldest first the popularity of the video e.g. based on the total number of times the video has been selected by other users in a random order or using any other mechanism for sorting a set of videos.

User interface also allows users to indicate a desired maximum video length and desired newness using sliders and . Slider sets a maximum video length. When slider is to the far right there is no restriction on video length. As the slider is moved to the left only shorter and shorter videos may be included in the results. For example if slider is at the midpoint of the scale only video clips that are less than thirty minutes are included in the results. If the slider is at the far left only video clips that are less than five minutes are included in the results. Similarly slider sets a maximum date range. When slider is to the far right there is no restriction how old the video may be. As the slider is moved to the left only more and more recent videos may be included in the resulting display.

Mosaic is a two by two grid of listings . However any other arrangement may be used such as a three by three or two by three grid. Furthermore although each listing is shown to be the same size they may also be different sizes. Listings may be of different sizes or graphically accentuated to indicate degrees of interest to the user the relevance of each identified video following a search or to emphasize certain content as desired by the media provider or based on user preferences. Various systems and methods for graphically accentuating media listings are discussed in for example Yates U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 324 202 filed Dec. 29 2005 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Each listing may be a selectable frame. In one embodiment of the invention upon a user selection of a selectable frame the user is directed to the website where the corresponding video may be downloaded or streamed. The website may be displayed in an overlay or in a new screen. In another embodiment of the invention upon user selection of listing additional information about the video such as the description of the program may be presented to the user in an overlay or in right column . Based on the additional information the user may choose to be directed to the website where the video is provided may add the video to a My Favorite Videos list or may add the video to view queue .

View queue displays a list of videos that a user has chosen to view at a later time. Each video may be represented by a graphical identifier such as a screenshot thumbnail a preview of the video or the video itself. In one embodiment of the invention each video identifier is selectable which provides the user with easy access to the videos that the user intends to watch. When a video from the view queue is selected the user may be directed to the website where the video is provided. The video may be removed from the view queue automatically when the video is selected or the user may manually remove the video from the view queue. In another embodiment of the invention view queue acts as a playlist. When the user is ready to watch a video from the view queue the user is directed to the website of the first video in the view queue.

Right column may display two types of information. It may 1 present recommended videos to the user or 2 display additional information about a selected video. show rightmost column performing the former function of displaying recommendations to the user. The latter function will be described in detail below in connection with . Heading of column reads TODAY S TOP PICKS indicating that the recommendations are chosen based on the most popular videos for the day. Other ways to provide recommendations to the user will be discussed in detail below in connection with . The recommended videos may be presented to the user by providing a format similar to listing discussed above and in connection with . Alternatively a recommended video may be displayed by listing the title of the video a graphical identifier for the video with a ratings overlay and a brief program description of the video. Other information may be provided for each video in column .

When a user initially enters the guidance application the top picks may be based on the most popular videos of all available videos in any category. As the user defines video types of interest by searching for keywords or selecting criteria elements in left column the recommended videos in right column may change to reflect the user s actions. For example if the user chooses the Action Adventure criteria element in window the videos under TODAY S TOP PICKS may be changed to include the top one or more of the most popular action adventure videos of the day.

Recommendations provided in right column may be based on criteria other than popularity. For example recommendations may be based on an editor s recommendation as shown in column of . Heading reads EDITOR S PICKS to reflect the way in which the recommended videos are chosen. The editor may be a famous movie or television critic or any other personality that a user may identify with. Consistent with one embodiment of the present invention column may provide more information about each recommended video than the listings in mosaic . For example for each recommended video title graphical identifier e.g. thumbnail screenshot etc. with ratings overlay and brief description are displayed. Rating for each video may be based on user entered ratings. Other information about the video may include network symbol e.g. FOX from the network that the video was originally broadcast the genre e.g. action adventure drama etc. or type e.g. television episode movie etc. length of the video and cost to download or stream the video. FOX is a registered trademark owned by FOX Broadcast Company. Column is merely illustrative and therefore more or less information about a video than the above mentioned may be displayed.

Techniques may be used for choosing recommendations for a user other than based on popularity or an editor s picks. The recommendations may be based on the user s interest. The user s interest may be obtained by monitoring user behavior on the media guidance application by express user designations or from a user profile. For example if the user does not like action adventure videos the recommended videos may be the most popular two or three videos excluding action adventure videos. If the user typically watches videos highlighted by Roger Ebert the recommended videos may be two or three videos that were most recently highlighted by Roger Ebert.

When a user selects a video from either mosaic or the recommended videos right column may display options to the user for the selected video as shown in . In addition more information about the video may be displayed. shows the result of selecting the first video in or one of the videos of mosaic . In addition to informational content about the selected video selectable options and are presented to the user. Selectable button opens a new display or overlay and directs the user to the website where the video is provided. Selectable button adds the current video to view queue and selectable button adds the video to a user s favorites list.

Options provide links related to the currently displayed video. Thus if the user enjoys the video the user may be directed to related videos. Related videos are presented to the user as keywords . Keywords may be actors or other celebrities associated with the video the network the program is on related networks or any other keywords associated with the video. Next to each keyword in the list is a number that corresponds to the number of available videos related to the keyword. For example in Kiefer Sutherland is an actor in the selected show and there are 392 available videos with that actor. If the user chooses selectable link mosaic is reflected to include the 392 videos. Rightmost column may then revert to providing recommendations to the user based on the selected keyword .

Column may present other options related to the selected video including Send to Friend and Blog about this Video features. Feature allows a user to notify a friend about the current video. In one embodiment of the invention the URL of the website that provides the video may be sent to the e mail address of a friend or may be sent to a friend using any other suitable means. In another embodiment of the invention the video may be added to a recommended list in the friend s user profile which the friend may access when he or she accesses his or her account on the media guidance application. An e mail or any other method for distributing information may also be sent to the friend to notify the friend that a new recommendation has been added.

Feature may direct the user to a new display screen not pictured . The display screen may allow the user to enter his or her thoughts or comments about a video after viewing the video. These thoughts may be saved in a blog associated with the user. The blog may contain various entries where each entry corresponds to a particular video or related media information about the video e.g. a particular genre show channel actor etc. . In some embodiments by selecting option an entry about the video may be automatically started. The blog may be stored in a user profile. The blog may be saved on the user s device and may be only accessible to the user. Alternatively the blog may be saved remotely and the blog may be accessible to users designated as a friend or may be open to the public to read.

Other features that may be provided to a user by column but are not shown to avoid cluttering the figure are options to rate the video visit a forum about the video or go to a wiki able page about the video. If desired the user may be directed to a forum to discuss the video or a topic related to the video e.g. the television show the network providing the video actors in the video etc. . The user may also go to a wiki able page about the video or a topic related to the video to share information with other guidance application users.

A media guidance application such as an application that provides display screen of may be personalized based on a user s preferences. A personalized media guidance application allows a user to customize displays and features to create a personalized experience with the media guidance application. This personalized experience may be created by allowing a user to input these customizations and or by the media guidance application monitoring user activity to determine various user preferences. Users may access their personalized guidance application by logging in or otherwise identifying themselves to the guidance application. Customization of the media guidance application may be made in accordance with a user profile. The customizations may include varying presentation schemes e.g. color scheme of displays font size of text etc. aspects of media content listings displayed e.g. recommended media content etc. aspects of criteria elements displayed e.g. ordering of categories or criteria elements etc. parental control settings and other desired customizations.

The media guidance application may allow a user to provide user profile information or may automatically compile user profile information. The media guidance application may for example monitor the media the user accesses and or other interactions the user may have with the guidance application. Additionally the media guidance application may obtain all or part of other user profiles that are related to a particular user e.g. from other web sites on the Internet the user accesses such as www.tvguide.com from other media guidance applications the user accesses from other interactive applications the user accesses from a handheld device of the user etc. and or obtain information about the user from other sources that the media guidance application may access. As a result a user can be provided with a unified guidance application experience across the user s different devices. This type of user experience is described in greater detail below in connection with . Additional personalized media guidance application features are described in greater detail in Ellis et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 179 410 filed Jul. 11 2005 Boyer et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 437 304 filed Nov. 9 1999 and Ellis et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 105 128 filed Feb. 21 2002 which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.

A user may enter preferences to customize the display provided by a guidance application such as through display in . The user preferences may be saved in a user profile associated with the user. User interface may display the user s favorite videos the user s display preferences and may allow the user to add or remove preferences. My Favorite Videos list is a list of videos where each video has been marked as a favorite by the user by for example selecting the Add to My Favorites selectable button . Each entry in the list may be identified by a graphical identifier e.g. screenshot thumbnail and textual information . Textual information may include the title of the video the length of the video the date that the video became available and any other relevant information. The close indicator next to each video in list allows the user to remove any individual video from the list. My Favorite Videos list may be different from view queue for at least the reason that the favorites list is saved more permanently e.g. in a user profile . The user may therefore leave the guidance application and return to the application at a later time without losing the information saved in display . Below favorites list is Send to Friend link . Link allows the user to send the videos in the user s favorites list to a friend. Favorites list may be sent to a friend using any of the techniques described in connection with link in .

A user may enter viewing preferences in My Preferences list . My Preferences list may include one or more of the user s favorite editors . My Preferences list may include one or more favorite types of videos . Any of the selectable criteria elements available in left column e.g. a criteria element within genre channels shows hotlists video type etc. of user interface may be included in My Preferences list. Any of the preferences entered by the user may be removed by selecting button corresponding to the preference and preferences may be added by selecting link . Link may bring the user to a new screen not pictured or overlay where the user is allowed to choose additional options to include in My Preferences.

Link may be used to set up alerts when new videos of interest to the user are available. The user may be notified when a new video becomes available that meets one or more criteria elements in My Preferences list . The user may set up the alerts so that any or all of the criteria elements are used to trigger an alert. The alerts may be in e mail text message or other suitable form for delivering the news that new videos of interest to the user have become available.

User interface may be customized based on the preferences entered into lists and . List excludes any videos from being displayed that do not possess a property of at least one of the criteria elements in the list. For example in illustrative user interface the user has designated that he or she only wants to view results that are in the genre of action adventure. The filtering effect of list may only occur if at least one criteria element is selected.

List may exclude videos that satisfy any of the criteria elements in the list to be presented to the user. Therefore if list is empty then list has no effect on the videos that are presented to the user. By using either list or list the user has significant control over what types of videos may or may not be returned in any searches. Display may also include other options for customizing user interface . In some embodiments a user may change the format or options of left column . The user may include or exclude categories from being displayed. The user may choose the order in which the categories or criteria elements are displayed.

The example display screens shown in and A B illustrate typical usage scenarios of user interface and in particular left column . The scenarios are described with reference to Venn diagram in . At various stages column may take the form of columns A C in . In this scenario column is used as a scope narrowing mechanism whereby the number of identified videos decreases with each selected criteria element. Initially column may include categories for genre channels shows and hotlists. The genre category may default to being selected and criteria elements of the genre category are displayed. See Upon user selection of the criteria element News in the genre category the criteria element is listed below the genre category heading and above the window of selectable elements. Next to selected criteria element is close button which may be used to deselect the criteria element and remove the criteria element from its position above window . Following user selection of the news genre available online videos in the news genre are identified. The number of identified videos or is displayed at which is consistent with the number of available news videos in Venn diagram .

If a user selection of the category channels is received window of selectable elements corresponding to the genre category is closed. Window corresponding to the channels category is presented below the channels category heading. The criteria elements in window each have videos in the news genre. Channels that do not have videos in the news genre are not included in window . When a user selection of criteria element Comedy Central is received as before the criteria element is moved to below the category heading and close button is provided next to the criteria element. Following user selection of the Comedy Central channel criteria element available online videos are identified that are both in the news genre and related to Comedy Central. The number of identified videos or 139 is shown at . Thus of the 2000 videos in the news genre only 139 of them are related to Comedy Central and the scope of the video set is narrowed accordingly. This is consistent with in Venn diagram .

Following a selection of C SPAN in the channels category the remaining number of videos or 30 is displayed in of . Thus of the 139 videos meeting both the news and Comedy Central criteria only 30 of the videos are also related to C SPAN. This number is consistent with in Venn diagram . If the show category is selected window is closed and a new window corresponding to television shows window is presented below the shows category heading. Note that only one show The Daily Show is listed in the window. This indicates that all 30 of the videos that are news based related to Comedy Central and related to C SPAN are on or at least related to The Daily Show.

If a user indication is received to remove the Comedy Central criteria element e.g. if user selection of button is received the identified videos only need to meet the news and C SPAN criteria which according to Venn diagram would result in 818 videos. This may then be reflected on the user interface not pictured . The criteria elements would change accordingly and would include shows that have available videos that meet both the news and C SPAN criteria.

Column may also take on the forms of A and B in . In this usage scenario the scope narrowing mechanism may at times increase the set of identified videos with subsequent selections of criteria elements. The steps involved in reaching the configuration shown in may be achieved by the steps discussed above in connection with . Thus for convenience is reproduced as . In the news criteria element of the genre category and the Comedy Central criteria element of the channels category have been selected and criteria elements of the channel category are displayed. This results in 139 videos as is consistent with Venn diagram .

Following a selection of C SPAN in the channels category the identified videos are expanded to include news related videos in either Comedy Central or C SPAN. Accordingly the number of identified videos shown at is increased from 139 to 627 videos. As can be seen from viewing a window of selectable criteria elements in the shows category e.g. by selecting the shows category news related shows from both Comedy Central and C SPAN are listed. Note that in window videos from each channel are separated shows are from Comedy Central and shows are from C SPAN to show that they meet different criteria elements in another category. In some embodiments the criteria elements are displayed together e.g. alphabetically without regard to the selected criteria elements in other categories.

If a user indication is received to remove the Comedy Central criteria element e.g. if user selection of button is received the set of videos may be narrowed. In this case the identified videos would need to meet the news and C SPAN criteria which according to Venn diagram would reduce the set of videos from 627 to 518. This may then be reflected in the user interface not pictured . The criteria elements would change accordingly and would include shows that have available videos that meet both the news and C SPAN criteria.

WEBTV is a trademark owned by Microsoft Corp. Wireless user communications device may include PDAs a mobile telephone a portable video player a portable music player a portable gaming machine or other wireless devices.

It should be noted that with the advent of television tuner cards for PC s WebTV and the integration of video into other user equipment devices the lines have become blurred when trying to classify a device as one of the above devices. In fact each of user television equipment user computer equipment and wireless user communications device may utilize at least some of the system features described above in connection with and as a result include flexibility with respect to the type of media content available on the device. For example user television equipment may be Internet enabled allowing for access to Internet content while user computer equipment may include a tuner allowing for access to television programming. The media guidance application may also have the same layout on the various different types of user equipment or may be tailored to the display capabilities of the user equipment. For example on user computer equipment the guidance application may be provided as a web site accessed by a web browser. In another example the guidance application may be scaled down for wireless user communications devices.

In system there is typically more than one of each type of user equipment device but only one of each is shown in to avoid overcomplicating the drawing. In addition each user may utilize more than one type of user equipment device e.g. a user may have a television set and a computer and also more than one of each type of user equipment device e.g. a user may have a PDA and a mobile telephone and or multiple television sets .

Other media sources may include one or more types of media distribution equipment including a television distribution facility cable system headend satellite distribution facility programming sources e.g. television broadcasters such as NBC ABC HBO etc. intermediate distribution facilities and or servers on demand media servers and other media content providers. NBC is a trademark owned by the National Broadcasting Company Inc. ABC is a trademark owned by the ABC INC. and HBO is a trademark owned by the Home Box Office Inc. Other media sources may be the originator of media content e.g. a television broadcaster a Webcast provider etc. or may not be the originator of media content e.g. an on demand media content provider etc. . Other media sources may include cable sources satellite providers on demand providers or other providers of media content. Other media sources may also include a remote media server used to store different types of media content including video content selected by a user in a location remote from any of the user equipment devices. Systems and methods for remote storage of media content and providing remotely stored media content to user equipment are discussed in greater detail in connection with Ellis et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 332 244 filed Jun. 11 1999 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Media guidance data source may provide media guidance data for a media guidance application. Media guidance data source includes data store and and may provide guidance data from either data store. The guidance data may include program information such as a program title an episode title an episode synopsis editorial commentary etc. typically found in for example TV Guide Magazine or on www.tvguide.com. Data stores and may be one or more relational databases or other suitable storage mechanisms. Data stores and may be local as shown in system or in remote locations.

Data store stores media guidance data that may or may not be available online. The stored media guidance data may include media listings media related information e.g. broadcast times broadcast channels media titles media descriptions ratings information e.g. parental control ratings critic s ratings etc. genre or category information actor information logo data for broadcasters or providers logos etc. media format e.g. MPEG advertisement information e.g. text images media clips etc. and any other type of guidance data that is helpful for a user to navigate among and locate desired media selections. Data store may also store identifiers into data store that reference related media.

Media guidance data source may also include data store . Data store stores information related to the videos available on web servers . Data store may store the metadata e.g. title description URL etc. associated with each video from web servers or may store information derived from the metadata. Data store may also store metadata not provided from web servers e.g. date entered into data store popularity user generated tags keywords etc. . Data store may store identifiers into data store to indicate additional media guidance data related to the videos found from web servers . In some embodiments data store stores the online media provided by web servers along with information about the media.

Media guidance application data may be provided to the user equipment devices using any suitable approach. In some embodiments the guidance application may be a stand alone interactive television program guide that receives program guide data via a data feed e.g. a continuous feed trickle feed or data in the vertical blanking interval of a channel . Program schedule data and other guidance data may be provided to the user equipment on a television channel sideband in the vertical blanking interval of a television channel using an in band digital signal using an out of band digital signal or by any other suitable data transmission technique. Program schedule data and other guidance data may be provided to user equipment on multiple analog or digital television channels. Program schedule data and other guidance data may be provided to the user equipment with any suitable frequency e.g. continuously daily a user specified period of time a system specified period of time in response to a request from user equipment etc. . In some approaches guidance data from media guidance data source and or other media sources may be provided to users equipment using a client server approach. For example a guidance application client residing on the user s equipment may initiate sessions with source to obtain guidance data when needed. Media guidance data source may provide user equipment devices and the media guidance application itself or software updates for the media guidance application.

Media guidance applications may be for example stand alone applications implemented on user equipment devices. In other embodiments media guidance applications may be client server applications where only the client resides on the user equipment device. For example media guidance applications may be implemented partially as a client application on control circuitry of user equipment device and partially on a remote server as a server application e.g. media guidance data source . The guidance application displays may be generated by the media guidance data source and transmitted to the user equipment devices. The media guidance data source may also transmit data for storage on the user equipment which then generates the guidance application displays based on instructions processed by control circuitry.

Media guidance system is intended to illustrate a number of approaches or network configurations by which user equipment devices and sources of media content and guidance data may communicate with each other for the purpose of accessing media including Internet delivered content and providing media guidance. The present invention may be applied in any one or a subset of these approaches or in a system employing other approaches for delivering media and providing media guidance. The following three approaches provide specific illustrations of the generalized example of .

In one approach user equipment devices may communicate with each other within a home network. User equipment devices can communicate with each other directly via short range point to point communication schemes describe above via indirect paths through a hub or other similar device provided on a home network or via communications network . Each of the multiple individuals in a single home may operate different user equipment devices on the home network. As a result it may be desirable for various media guidance information including media guidance information for Internet delivered content or settings to be communicated between the different user equipment devices. For example it may be desirable for users to maintain consistent media guidance application settings on different user equipment devices within a home network as described in greater detail in Ellis et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 179 410 filed Jul. 11 2005. Different types of user equipment devices in a home network may also communicate with each other to transmit media content. For example a user may transmit online media content from user computer equipment to a portable video player or portable music player.

In a second approach users may have multiple types of user equipment by which they access media content including Internet delivered media content and obtain media guidance. For example some users may have home networks that are accessed by in home and mobile devices. Users may control in home devices via a media guidance application implemented on a remote device. For example users may access an online media guidance application on a website via a personal computer at their office or a mobile device such as a PDA or web enabled mobile telephone. The user may set various settings e.g. recordings reminders or other settings on the online guidance application to control the user s in home equipment. The online guide may control the user s equipment directly or by communicating with a media guidance application on the user s in home equipment. Various systems and methods for user equipment devices communicating where the user equipment devices are in locations remote from each other is discussed in for example Ellis et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 927 814 filed Aug. 26 2004 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

In a third approach users of user equipment devices inside and outside a home can use their media guidance application to communicate directly with web servers or other media content sources to access Internet delivered and other media content. Specifically within a home users of user television equipment and user computer equipment may access the media guidance application to navigate among and locate desirable media content. Users may also access the media guidance application outside of the home using wireless user communications devices to navigate among and locate desirable media content.

It will be appreciated that while the discussion of media content has focused on video content the principles of media guidance can be applied to other types of media content such as music images etc.

A more detailed view of an embodiment of media guidance data source is shown in . In addition to data stores and media guidance data source may contain web crawler device and web server . Web crawler device and web server may each include one or more of processing circuitry and and storage and .

Data manager user equipment may include processing circuitry and storage . Data manager user equipment may be one of user equipment devices or . Data manager user equipment may include any or all of the components of user equipment devices. In data manager user equipment is local to data store and may communicate with data store through any path described in connection with I O paths and . In some embodiments data manager user equipment is a standard user equipment e.g. laptop mobile device etc. remote from system and a data manager may sign in to gain access through web crawler device or web server . Typically there is more than one data manager user equipment in system but only one is shown to avoid overcomplicating the drawing.

In a typical usage scenario a data manager may use data manager user equipment to access retrieve add remove or update entries in data store . Data managers may correct incorrect information about online videos remove videos that have become unavailable add online media information and or online media content add tags related to entries in data store or add any information that may be used by web crawler device and web server . For example data managers may tag certain web servers so that any listing from these tagged web servers are accentuated in the listing.

Editor s picks data store may be one or more relational databases or other suitable storage mechanisms. Editor s picks database may contain separate storage space for each editor. Editor s picks database may contain editor preference designations for an individual online media. In addition editor s picks database may contain hotlists for each editor where a hotlist is a list of the editor s favorite or preferred media. For each editor preference designation in editor s pick database editor s picks database may store links into data stores and . The links may be used by web server when generating displays or gathering data for media guidance applications. In some embodiments editor s picks data store is part of storage in web server .

Editor user equipment may include processing circuitry and storage . Editor user equipment may include the features and or components discussed in connection with data manager user equipment . Editor user equipment may communicate either remotely or locally with editor s picks data store through any path described in connection with I O paths and . In some embodiments editor user equipment may have access to a portion of storage in web server and editor preference designations may be stored in storage . In a typical usage scenario an editor may enter preference designations in a manner similar to the way users enter media into a My Favorites list see . Typically there is more than one editor user equipment in system but only one is shown to avoid overcomplicating the drawing.

In the present invention an online media guidance application may choose a set of videos and information about the chosen videos may be displayed to the user. Flow diagram of illustrative steps involved in obtaining and providing media guidance data is shown in . Online videos from one or more online media providers e.g. web servers are identified and accessed at step . Information for each identified video may be obtained from the online media provider. In some embodiments a plurality of Internet sites are crawled and metadata corresponding to available videos are scraped from the Internet sites. The Internet sites may include web sites of online media providers. Video metadata may include the video title description video URL source name source URL genre program type e.g. clip full length episode online only movie trailers screenshots thumbnails actors in the video running time character names video format e.g. REAL WMV Flash Quicktime etc. active expire date stream download DRM price and resolution e.g. full screen 320 240 etc. .

The collected metadata for each identified video may be stored e.g. in data store at step . In addition other metadata not obtained from the media provider e.g. keywords or tags added by a data manager e.g. from data manager user equipment user ratings popularity date video was found on the internet editor preference designations wiki able content data etc. may be stored in addition to the collected metadata. The stored metadata may be updated continually at fixed or varying time intervals or may not be updated at all. In some embodiments the identified online video itself e.g. the actual video file clip asset is stored as well.

At step the metadata for each of the videos may be associated with media guidance data where the media guidance data may be stored in a media guidance database. The association may be determined based on comparing the video metadata with metadata in the media guidance database e.g. data store or the association may be added by a data manager. In some embodiments some of the collected metadata is used for making associations with media guidance data and is not actually stored at step . In still other embodiments a degree of relevance may be stored instead of just an association. For instance the metadata may be compared and a higher degree of relevance may be given to online videos that match a larger percentage of the metadata.

At step each video may be associated with one or more entries in the media guidance database. For example the metadata for a video of a television episode may be associated with guidance data on the television show the television episode the actors in the show the television network or any editors that have commented on the episode or show. An association may be made by storing the video metadata with a tag from the media guidance database. Alternatively associations or links between the stored metadata and the media guidance data may be saved remotely.

A subset of the videos may be selected at step . The subset may be chosen automatically based on an editor s preference designations e.g. from editor s pick database or based on user personalization data. User personalization data may be obtained from monitoring user behavior from a user profile or from express designations made by the user see . A set of the videos may also be chosen automatically based on such criteria as the popularity or newness of the videos see column of .

A subset of the videos may be selected at step in response to receiving a user command. The user may enter one or more search terms or keywords e.g. in search bar and the subset of videos may be determined based on a comparison of the keywords with the stored metadata associated with each video. The user may select particular criteria elements e.g. genre show channel clip length etc. of interest e.g. using column of . The subset of videos may be those that meet the criteria and are determined based on examining stored metadata.

There is metadata associated with both the media guidance data and the online video. Therefore the subset of videos may be determined by comparing search terms or other criteria to either sources of metadata. In one embodiment search terms and or other criteria elements are compared to the metadata of the media guidance application. The comparison returns relevant media guidance data. Since there are associations linking the media guidance data to related online video a subset of the videos may be determined. In another embodiment of the invention the subset of videos is determined based on a comparison of search keywords and or other criteria to the metadata of the videos. Depending on how the collected metadata is stored the amount of metadata for each collected video and how the associations are made the two techniques may or may not return the same set of videos.

In some embodiments the media guidance database includes more than media guidance data. The media guidance database also includes media such as video media. In this case the subset of videos identified in step may include videos identified from the internet and or videos stored in the media guidance database.

A display indicating each video of the subset of videos is generated at step . The display for each video in the subset includes guidance application data from the guidance application database. The guidance application data is determined based on the associations created in step . The display may also include some or all of the collected and or generated video metadata e.g. in text box of in column of as keywords in etc. . In some embodiments the display is a mosaic where each video in the subset is represented by at least a graphical identifier e.g. still image from the video . In other embodiments the display may be text only. Also the displayed media listings may indicate the relevancy of each listing where the relevancy may be determined based on a data manager s indication see or a degree of relevancy assessed when the listing was associated with media guidance data at step .

In some embodiments an online media guidance application may direct a user to media content of interest to the user. Flow diagram of shows illustrative steps for providing such a feature. Online media information may be obtained and processed based on the strategies discussed in steps to in . A subset of the videos may be identified at step using any of the techniques discussed in step including choosing videos based on user personalization data editor s preference designations user entered search terms e.g. in search bar in or user selected criteria elements e.g. in left column in . At step a display is generated using a frame from each of the identified videos. The display may be similar to display screen shown in . A user selection of a frame is received by the online media guidance application at step . Based on the selection at step the guidance application directs the user to the website that provides the selected media content. The website may be provided in an overlay in a frame within the guidance application or may be shown on the full screen.

In accordance with a principle of the present invention a set of videos may be identified and further refined based on user selection of selectable criteria elements. Flow diagram of illustrates such a process. Online media information may be obtained and processed based on the strategies discussed in steps to . Criteria elements e.g. action adventure news ABC Comedy Central etc. may be displayed to a user such as in window of at step . In some embodiments the selectable criteria elements may be a predefined set of criteria elements that are always displayed. In other embodiments the selectable criteria elements may include only criteria elements that meet the media identified from the Internet at step .

At step the media guidance application receives user indication of one of the selectable criteria elements. Based on the selected criteria element a subset of the identified media is selected at step . Since the selected criteria element is the first criterion chosen by the user the subset is chosen based on only this selected criteria element. However if other selected criteria elements had already been received the subset of videos may be chosen based on one or more of all the selected criteria elements. The subset of identified videos may be chosen based on any of the strategies discussed above in connection with step of .

After a subset of videos is chosen a display may be generated indicating each video in the subset at step such as in mosaic of . This step may proceed by using any of the techniques discussed in connection with . The media guidance application may then receive a user selection of another selectable criteria element at . This would refine the chosen subset of videos at step and the altered subset would be reflected in the display generated at step .

In some embodiments a guidance application may display selectable criteria elements grouped into categories. Based on user selection videos of interest to the user may be identified and the displayed criteria elements may be updated accordingly. The identified videos may therefore depend not only on which criteria elements are selected but also on what categories have selected criteria elements. Flow chart of is an illustrative flow chart in accordance with a principle of the present invention. As discussed in greater detail below flow chart may take on many embodiments.

In one embodiment of flow chart a set of identified videos depends only on the most recently selected criteria element. When the user first enters the guidance application a plurality of categories is displayed to the user at step . For example the categories may be genre channels shows and hotlists see column of . In addition one of the categories may default to a selected stage where a window of criteria elements within the category is displayed. In some embodiments a criteria element for a selected category is displayed only if at least one video in the database meets the criteria element.

Upon receiving a user selection at step if the selection is a criteria element within a selected category e.g. criteria element in videos that meet the selected criterion are identified at step . The videos may be identified based on any of the strategies discussed in connection with . The identified videos may be displayed in a mosaic such as in display screen of . The media guidance application may then receive a user selection of another criterion in the current category or receive a selection of a different category step .

Upon receiving a user selection at step if the selection is a category other than the currently selected category the window of selectable criteria elements corresponding to the currently selected category is closed at step . A new window is presented at step and selectable criteria elements corresponding to the newly selected category are displayed within the new window. The window may be situated directly below the category to indicate that the window corresponds to that category. The user interface may then receive a user selection of a criteria element in the newly selected category or receive a selection of a different category step .

In another embodiment of flow chart the media guidance application may keep track of selected criteria elements and use each selected criteria element to narrow the scope of the identified videos. When the user first enters the guidance application a plurality of categories is displayed to the user at step . For example the categories may be genre channels shows and hotlists see column of . In addition one of the categories may default to a selected stage where a window of criteria elements within the category is displayed.

Upon receiving a user selection at step if the selection is a criteria element within the selected category videos that meet the selected criterion and all previously selected criteria are identified step . Since selecting the criteria element adds a condition that all identified videos must meet selecting the criteria element narrows the video set and decreases the number of identified videos. For an example see the discussion of columns B and C of where a set of identified videos is reduced from 139 in to 30 in . When multiple criteria elements are selected from one or more categories the identified videos meet the Boolean expression SC1 AND SC2 AND . . . AND newly selected criterion where SCX stands for selected criterion X. Alternatively other suitable multiple selection criteria schemes may be utilized such as an inclusive selection of all identified videos falling within any one of a plurality of selection criteria the identified videos may meet the Boolean expression SC1 OR SC2 OR . . . OR newly selected criterion where SCX stands for selected criterion X. 

Upon receiving a user selection at step if the selection is an indication to close a previously selected criteria element e.g. by selecting button of display screen the criterion corresponding to the close indication is deselected step . Thus the set of identified videos expands to include all videos that meet the remaining selected criteria elements but not the deselected criteria element at step .

Upon receiving a user selection at step if the selection is a category other than the currently selected category the window corresponding to the currently selected category may be closed at step e.g. window of . A new window is presented e.g. window of and selectable criteria elements corresponding to the newly selected category are displayed within the new window step . The selectable criteria elements may include criteria elements that if selected would result in at least one identified video. That is a selectable criteria element in the newly selected category may be displayed if there are available videos that meet the criteria element and all previously selected criteria elements.

Similarly upon user selection of a criteria element at the remaining selectable criteria elements in the category may also be reduced in conjunction with narrowing the identified videos at step . That is after narrowing the set of identified videos a selectable criteria element may be removed from the list if there are no videos in the narrowed set that also meet the selectable criteria element.

In another embodiment of flow chart selecting multiple criteria elements may expand the set of identified videos. When the user first enters the guidance application the media guidance application may display a plurality of categories at step . For example the categories may be genre channels shows and hotlists. In addition one of the categories may default to a selected stage where a window of criteria elements within the category is displayed.

Upon receiving a user selection at step if the selection is a criteria element within the selected category a set of videos is identified where each video meets 1 the selected criteria element or any of the previously selected criteria elements of the same category and 2 at least one selected criteria element in each of the other categories that have at least one selected criteria element step . The video set may be expanded to include videos that meet only the newly selected criteria element and none of the previously selected criteria elements in the category. For an example see the discussion of columns A and B of where a set of identified videos is expanded from 139 in FIG. A to 627 in . Thus when multiple criteria elements are selected from one or more categories the identified videos meet the Boolean expression SC1OR . . . OR SCN AND SC1OR . . . OR SCN . . . where SCX represents selected criterion X in category Y. 

Upon receiving a user selection at step if the selection is an indication to close a previously selected criteria element e.g. by selecting button of display screen the criterion corresponding to the close indication is deselected step . Since a subset of the identified videos may have only met the deselected criterion in the category and none of the remaining selected criteria elements the videos in that subset are no longer identified and presented to the user step . Therefore deselecting a criteria element may narrow the video set and reduce the number of identified videos.

Upon receiving a user selection at step if the selection is a category other than the currently selected category the window corresponding to the currently selected category is closed at . A new window is presented below the newly selected category such as window of and selectable criteria elements corresponding to the newly selected category e.g. or of may be displayed within the new window step . The list of selectable criteria elements may include criteria elements that if selected would return at least one video. That is a selectable criteria element in the newly selected category may be displayed if there are videos in the database that meet 1 the selectable criteria element or any other previously selected criteria element in the same category and 2 at least one selected criteria element in each of the remaining categories with at least one selected element.

In another embodiment of flow chart the effect of selecting a criteria element may depend on which category the criteria element is in. For example selecting multiple criteria elements in some categories e.g. genre may cause the guidance application at step to identify videos that meet all of the selected criteria elements. Selecting multiple criteria elements in another category e.g. channels and shows may cause the guidance application to identify videos that meet any of the selected criteria elements. Essentially this embodiment is a combination of the two embodiments previously discussed. Thus when multiple criteria elements are selected from one or more categories the identified videos may meet the Boolean expression SC1OR . . . OR SCN AND SC1AND . . . AND SCN . . . where SCX represents selected criterion X in category Y. 

A media guidance application may also use keywords entered by a user to define a set of videos. shows illustrative flow diagram for providing videos and criteria elements following reception of one or more keywords. At step one or more keywords is received by the media guidance application. A set of videos is identified at step based on the one or more keywords. The set may be selected based on any of the strategies described above in connection with . A set of criteria elements of a category e.g. the selected category from step of may be displayed at step . The displayed criteria elements may include only those that meet the set of videos identified at step . The user may then continue changing the set of videos based on the strategies described in connection with flow diagram .

The foregoing describes systems and methods for acquiring categorizing and delivering online media content using an interactive media guidance application. The above described embodiments of the present invention are presented for purposes of illustration and not of limitation.
