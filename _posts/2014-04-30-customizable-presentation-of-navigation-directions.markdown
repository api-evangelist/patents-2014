The present disclosure relates to digital mapping data and more particularly to providing customizable presentation of navigation directions.

The background description provided herein is for the purpose of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently named inventors to the extent it is described in this background section as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure.

Today software applications executing in computers smartphones etc. or embedded devices generate step by step navigation directions. Typically a user specifies the starting point and the destination and a software application displays the directions immediately and or as the user travels from the starting point and the destination. In some cases the software applications also produce voice announcements corresponding to the navigation directions.

A navigation system implemented in a network server and or a user device provides navigation instructions to a user based on the user s selections of instruction specific presentation rules. A user can request step by step navigation instructions for travelling from a starting point which can be defined explicitly or implicitly to a destination. The navigation system can generate the instructions on the network server or locally on the user device. Each navigation instruction describes a maneuver which occurs at a location e.g. Turn left onto Walker Street . For each navigation instruction the user may indicate whether the instruction will be presented when the user arrives at the corresponding location. The presentation of a navigation instruction can include an audio announcement presentation of text and or a graphic a vibration signal etc. In some embodiments the user can also indicate a number of times the navigation instruction will be presented a level of detail for the navigation instruction e.g. expressed as one of several discrete level or as the period of time during the instruction will be presented . Once the user has made a selection for each navigation instruction or accepted certain default selections the navigation system creates a playlist. When the user begins travelling to the requested destination the navigation instructions are presented according to the playlist.

In particular an example embodiment of the techniques of the present disclosure is a method for customizing presentation of navigation directions in mapping applications. The method can be executed on one or more processors. The method includes obtaining navigation instructions that direct a user from a starting point to a destination. The method further includes displaying the navigation instructions via a user interface and providing for each of the navigation instructions an individually operable user control for specifying an instruction specific presentation rule. Still further the method includes receiving instruction specific presentation rules in accordance with which the navigation instructions are presented during navigation.

Another embodiment of these techniques is a client computing device including a user interface one or more processors coupled to a communication interface and the user interface and a non transitory computer readable memory storing instructions. When executed by the one or more processors the instructions cause the client device to obtain navigation instructions which direct a user from a starting point to a destination receive a instruction specific presentation rules for the navigation instructions via the user interface and present the navigation instructions in accordance with the received instruction specific presentation rules.

Yet another embodiment of these techniques is a method for customizing presentation of navigation directions in mapping applications. The method includes obtaining navigation instructions which direct a user from a starting point to a destination receiving for each navigation instruction a selection of an instruction specific presentation rule and causing the navigation instructions to be provided to a client device in accordance with the instruction specific presentation rule for each navigation instruction via a communication link.

Generally speaking techniques for providing navigation instructions according to instruction specific presentation rules can be implemented in navigation system operating in a portable computing device a non portable computing device one or several network servers a head unit of a vehicle or a system that includes a combination of these devices. However for clarity the examples below focus primarily on an embodiment in which a user generates a request for navigation directions on a portable computing device and in response a navigation data server generates navigation instructions and sends these instructions to the portable computing device. The portable computing device displays the navigation instructions on a user interface which allows the user to create a playlist that specifies how each navigation instruction should be presented according to one or more instruction specific presentation rules or simply presentation rules . The portable computing device then presents the navigation instructions according to the presentation rules via a local display device speaker etc. or via the audio visual components of the head unit.

In other implementations the techniques for generating navigation instructions can be implemented on the portable computing device. In yet other implementations the techniques for creating a playlist can be implemented on another computing device and the playlist can be transmitted to the client computing device. The playlist may be created on another computing device and played back on the head unit where the client computing device acts as an intermediary by obtaining the playlist and causing the navigation instructions to be played back according to the presentation rules on the head unit.

Generally speaking the examples below describe two stages for providing customizable presentation of navigation directions 1 configuration and 2 presentation. Configuration includes displaying the navigation instructions in some suitable format on the portable device or on another computing device for the user to specify instruction specific presentation rules and for the navigation system to create a playlist based on these rules. Configuration may occur prior to beginning the navigation session e.g. before the user departs from the starting point . During the presentation stage the system presents an instruction in accordance with the presentation rule as the user approaches a location corresponding to the navigation instruction. For example if the navigation instruction is Turn right onto Highway 94 playback does not occur until the user has completed the previous instruction and is approaching Highway 94. The two stages may be referred to herein as the configuration stage and the playback stage. 

Referring to an example environment in which the techniques outlined above can be implemented includes a portable device and a vehicle with a head unit . The portable device may be a smart phone or a tablet computer for example. The portable device communicates with the head unit of the vehicle via a communication link which may be wired e.g. Universal Serial Bus USB or wireless e.g. Bluetooth Wi Fi Direct . The portable device also can communicate with various content providers servers etc. via a wireless communication network such as a fourth or third generation cellular network 4G or 3G respectively .

In operation during the configuration stage the portable device obtains navigation data to navigate the driver from point A to point B in the form of a sequence of navigation instructions or maneuvers. As discussed in more detail below the portable device can receive navigation data via a communication network from a navigation service or can generate navigation data locally depending on the implementation. The portable device displays the navigation instructions and the user can create a playlist before the user arrives at point A by specifying a presentation rule for each navigation instruction. For example the user can select a presentation rule which causes the portable device to omit playback of a navigation instruction. As another example the user can select a presentation rule which causes the portable device to playback the navigation instruction more than once and the user can specify the number of times for playing back the navigation instruction.

During the playback stage the portable device presents audio and or visual instructions corresponding to the navigation instructions according to the user s selected presentation rules. The audio and or visual instructions are presented once the user arrives at each location corresponding to each respective navigation instruction e.g. the location of the maneuver described by the navigation instruction . In other embodiments the portable device causes the audio and or visual instructions to be provided to a head unit of a vehicle.

The head unit can include a display for presenting navigation information such as a digital map. The display in some implementations is a touchscreen and includes a software keyboard for entering text input which may include the name or address of a destination point of origin etc. Hardware input controls and on the head unit and the steering wheel respectively can be used for entering alphanumeric characters or to perform other functions for requesting navigation directions. The head unit also can include audio input and output components such as a microphone and speakers for example. The speakers can be used to play the audio instructions sent from the portable device and the display can be used to play the visual instructions sent from the portable device .

In operation during the configuration stage the navigation data server can receive a request for navigation directions for navigating to a specified destination and generate using street and road data stored in the map database step by step navigation instructions. The portable device implements a navigation module with customizable playback that receives the step by step navigation instructions from the navigation data server displays the step by step navigation instructions and allows the user to specify a presentation rule via one or more user controls for visual and or auditory presentation of each instruction included in the step by step navigation instructions. In the playback stage the portable device generates visual information related to the instruction by rendering a digital map displaying a route as an overlay displaying text etc. and or auditory information related to the instruction by generating a voice announcement using suitable text to speech TSS technology in accordance with the selected presentation rules. In some implementations information related to an instruction can also include a vibratory signal and or other signals.

In other implementations the portable device can store navigation and or map data in a local memory or on peripheral storage device such as an optical disk. In yet other implementations the module can be implemented in the navigation data server or distributed between the navigation data server and the portable device . Further generation of map images and voice announcements generally can be implemented on the portable device on the navigation data server partially on both or on another server.

Moreover in other implementations the other computing device can receive the step by step navigation instructions from the navigation data server and display them on the web browser . The user can login to a user profile maintained by an online service that provides navigation data for example. The user may create a playlist of the step by step navigation instructions by selecting instruction specific presentation rules. The online service may then allow the user to store the playlist. The playlist may be stored in an online storage service such as cloud storage. The user may login to the same user profile on the portable device and the portable device can retrieve the stored playlist for playback during the route.

The portable device is described in more detail with reference to . Referring to an example portable device includes one or more processors coupled to a memory . Each of the one or more processors can be any suitable general purpose processing unit e.g. a CPU a microprocessor or an application specific processing unit. The memory can a non transitory computer readable medium that can include persistent components such as a hard disk a flash drive etc. and non persistent components such as a random access memory RAM unit. The processor s and the memory can be interconnected via a suitable electrical connection such as a digital bus for example.

The portable device further includes a set of sensors that includes in this example configuration an accelerometer A and a gyrometer B to generate signals indicative of the orientation of the portable device in three dimensional space a positioning sensor C such as a global positioning service GPS module a proximity sensor D and one or more cameras E. The memory can store the corresponding drivers to process the signals from the sensors and determine various characteristics of the portable device . In other implementations the sensors can include additional sensors such as a digital compass to better or more quickly estimate the current orientation of the portable device a barometer to more quickly estimate the current altitude of the portable device a light sensor to measure the amount of ambient light etc. Conversely the portable device in some implementations does not include all of the sensors illustrated in .

The portable device also can include devices configured to receive user input and provide output to a user. The portable device can include a visual interface such as a screen a screen external to the portable device or any other component or a set of components for generating a visual presentation of data. In some implementations the screen is a touchscreen configured to both provide output and receive input. The audio interface of the portable device can include one or more speaker s or other suitable devices internal or external to the portable device . Further input devices of the portable device can include a keyboard and a microphone . More generally the portable device can include any suitable input and output devices in addition to or instead of the modules illustrated in .

In an example implementation the portable device further includes a graphics card to efficiently render graphics content such as interactive digital maps for example. Further the portable device includes a long range communication interface that can support wired and or wireless communications and a short range communication interface that also can support wired and or wireless communications. For example the short range communication interface can be a Universal Serial Bus USB link.

The memory stores a navigation module with customizable playback as a set of instructions executable on the one or more processors s for example. In various embodiments the module is implemented as an independent application an extension of another application such as a web browser as a script interpreted by a web browser or another application etc. The module includes a customizable playback selection module . The memory also can store various parameters of the module as well as data used by other software components.

With continued reference to the memory can store instructions that implement an operating system OS as well as instructions that implement various applications services drivers etc. not shown . The OS can provide application programming interfaces API to access various functions of the portable device . As one example the OS can process input from the sensors determines various characteristics and parameters of the portable device such as the current location orientation speed of travel and provide access to these characteristics via a set of APIs to software applications including the navigation module with customizable playback . The module can be generally similar to the module of .

In operation the navigation module with customizable playback can receive a request for navigation directions from a user via the keyboard the microphone or the screen if implemented as a touchscreen . In some embodiments with reference to a user can request navigation directions from the head unit which may be communicated to the portable device over the short range communication interface . The navigation directions may be requested via the software keyboard on the display the hardware input controls and or the microphone . The module can obtain navigation directions from a network server such as the navigation data server as a series of navigation instructions and provide these navigation instructions to the user via the output devices such as the screen . When the portable device is being used in a vehicle the module can provide some or all of the output to the head unit of the vehicle via the short range communication interface .

The customizable playback selection module displays one or more instruction specific presentation rule user controls which are individually controllable for each navigation instruction on the screen. For example the customizable playback selection module may include user controls for selecting to playback the navigation instruction not to playback the navigation instruction and to playback the navigation instruction multiple times as well as a user control to select the number of times the navigation instruction is played back. Moreover the customizable playback selection module may include user controls for selecting audio playback only of the navigation instruction visual playback only and both visual and audio playback of the navigation instruction.

Additionally there may be a user control to select the length of a navigation instruction. The user may choose to have the navigation instruction played back in full or alternatively may choose to playback a portion of the navigation instruction. For example if the navigation instruction is In 300 meters take the 1st left onto Main Street and the user chooses a length of one half the played back instruction may be Take the 1left onto Main Street. If the user chooses a length of one quarter the played back instruction may be Turn left onto Main Street. 

Moreover the customizable playback selection module may include a user control to condense multiple navigation instructions into a single uninterrupted instruction during playback. For example if there are several instructions which can be combined to direct the driver to Highway 94 the user can select a user control to combine the several navigation instructions to form a single instruction during playback such as Start out going East and turn right onto Highway 94. 

The user can select one or more presentation rules for each navigation instruction. Moreover the customizable playback selection module may include a default presentation rule for when the user does not make a selection. For example the default rule may be not to playback the navigation instruction. Once the customizable playback selection module receives instruction specific presentation rules for each navigation instruction a playlist created by the presentation rules may be stored in the memory of the portable device . In some embodiments the playlist may be stored at the navigation data server of or an online storage service such as a cloud service. In any event the navigation module with customizable playback causes the portable device to playback the navigation instructions according to the selected rules during the playback stage. The playback may be audio and or visual depending on the user s selections.

It is noted that although the examples above primarily focus on visual and auditory information the techniques of this disclosure also can be used with vibrational output and more generally any other type of output.

Moreover the user interface includes several options via one or more individually controllable user controls which enable a user to select one or more presentation rules for each navigation instruction. For example the user interface includes an indication of whether or not to playback each navigation instruction in an audio format during the playback stage also referred to herein as audio playback . When the user selects a user control to playback a navigation instruction the indication is highlighted. For example the user has selected the first navigation instruction the second navigation instruction and the navigation fourth instruction for audio playback. According to the user interface all other navigation instructions in the list will not be played back during the playback stage. In some embodiments an indication may be displayed in some other manner to show it has been selected. Moreover some embodiments may include an indication of whether or not to playback each navigation instruction in a visual format not shown during the playback stage also referred to herein as visual playback . The user interface also includes a Select all user control for allowing the user to select the entire list of navigation instructions. Each of the indications may be selected via user controls by clicking on a mouse or in the case of a touchscreen tapping a finger on the display or in any other suitable manner. If the user does not make a selection for a navigation instruction a default option may be not to playback the navigation instruction during the playback stage.

The user interface also includes a user control for the number of times to playback an audio instruction . For example the indication X associated with the second instruction suggests that audio for the second instruction will be played twice during the playback stage. Both times will occur after the user completes the maneuver corresponding to the first instruction the starting location and before the user completes the maneuver corresponding to the second instruction the ending location . Consequently the number of times determine the timing for playing back the navigation instruction. For example a navigation instruction configured to be played twice during the playback stage may be played once at the starting location and again at the ending location. A navigation instruction configured to be played three times during the playback stage may be played an additional time halfway between the starting location and the ending location. While the user interface indicates the second instruction will be played twice a user can select any number of times to play each instruction. The number of times may be selected via user controls by typing a number scrolling on a scroll bar clicking on a mouse where the number of mouse clicks corresponds to the number of times selected tapping a finger on the display where the number of taps corresponds to the number of times selected or in any other suitable manner.

In addition to indicating whether or not to play a navigation instruction and the number of times to play the instruction the user interface may also include a user control for the length of time for playing each navigation instruction. For example each navigation instruction may include an associated horizontal or vertical slider bar on the user interface where the opposite ends of the slider bar indicate a minimum and a maximum length for the navigation instruction. The user can select the length by adjusting the slider bar. When the user selects the maximum length the entire navigation instruction listed on the user interface may be played back during the playback stage. On the other hand when the user selects a length that is less than the maximum some portion of the navigation instruction listed on the user interface may be played back during the playback stage. In some embodiments the length of the navigation instruction is not controlled by a slider bar and may be controlled in some other suitable manner. More generally the user interface can include any suitable control for selecting the level of detail for an instruction. In one alternative implementation the user interface provides a pull down list of the available levels of detail e.g. normal low and high for each of the instructions.

Further the user interface may also include a user control for condensing multiple navigation instructions into a single uninterrupted instruction during the playback stage. For example the user may click and drag one navigation instruction into another navigation instruction to combine the two. In the case of a touchscreen a user may pinch the two instructions together. For example the user may click and drag the second navigation instruction Take the 1st left onto Pacific Highway into the first navigation instruction Head south on Miller Street towards Pacific Highway so that the condensed navigation instruction during the playback stage is Head south on Miller Street and take the 1st left onto Pacific Highway. The condensed instruction may be indicated on the user interface by including the condensed instruction in the list of navigation instructions and allowing a user to expand the condensed instruction to the original navigation instructions. In other embodiments the condensed instruction may be indicated in any other suitable manner.

After the playlist is created the user may store the playlist on the portable device on the navigation data server of or on an online storage service such as cloud storage for later retrieval when the user arrives at the starting point. During the playback stage each navigation instruction is played back according to the presentation rules selected by the user while creating the playlist.

When audio playback is selected for a navigation instruction a voice announcement is generated using suitable TSS technology and played through the speakers of the portable device or the head unit . The voice announcement may be generated several times for the same navigation instruction or may be a shorter voice announcement than the corresponding text of the navigation instruction e.g. if the user selects a shorter length or condenses a navigation instruction . When visual playback is selected for a navigation instruction a digital map may be rendered and the route may be displayed as an overlay on the screen of the portable device or the display on the head unit. In addition text may be displayed on the digital map corresponding to the navigation instruction and according to the selected presentation rules. When both audio and visual playback are selected for a navigation instruction both a voice announcement corresponding to the navigation instruction is generated and text corresponding to the navigation instruction is displayed.

According to the user selections from user interface of during the configuration stage audio playback is selected for the first instruction . Once the user begins heading south on Miller Street the second navigation instruction is played back. Because the user selected audio playback twice for the second navigation instruction a voice announcement is generated twice corresponding to the navigation instruction until the user passes the ending location by turning left onto Pacific Highway . After the user turns onto Pacific Highway the third instruction is not played back according to the presentation rule selected on the user interface . As a result a voice announcement is not generated and text describing the navigation instruction is not displayed on the map. The playback stage continues in a similar manner until the user arrives at the destination Manly. As mentioned above the instruction specific presentation rules are not limited to whether or not to playback a navigation instruction. Instead the presentation rules may indicate to playback a shortened version of the navigation instruction a condensed version of multiple navigation instructions etc.

The navigation instructions are then displayed on a user interface during the configuration stage block . The user interface may be on the portable device or the other computing device . Also displayed on the user interface are several presentation rule options. For example next to each navigation instruction the user interface may display user controls allowing the user to select audio playback visual playback no playback a number of times for playback a length of the navigation instruction for playback a condensed version of multiple navigation instructions into one navigation instruction for playback etc.

At block a selection of an instruction specific presentation rule for each navigation instruction is obtained via the user interface. In some embodiments a user may select multiple presentation rules for a single navigation instruction. For example the user may select audio playback as well as a shortened version of the navigation instruction. Moreover the instruction specific presentation rules may include a default rule such as for example no playback if the user does not select a presentation rule for a navigation instruction.

At block the method determines whether a presentation rule has been received for every navigation instruction. If not the method repeats block until every navigation instruction has a corresponding presentation rule. In some embodiments when the user does not select a presentation rule for a navigation instruction a default rule is automatically selected as mentioned above. In this case the method may repeat block until the user confirms all selections have been made e.g. by selecting a Submit option on the user interface . In other embodiments the method may repeat block until the user arrives at the starting point for the navigation instructions and the playback stage begins. In any event once the method determines a presentation rules has been received for every navigation instruction a playlist corresponding to the presentation rules is stored at the portable device the navigation data server or an online storage system such as cloud storage.

At block the playback stage begins and the navigation instructions are presented in accordance with the instruction specific presentation rule for each navigation instruction. For example a voice announcement for a navigation instruction may be generated as the user approaches a location for the maneuver corresponding to the navigation instruction. The navigation instructions may be presented on the speakers and or the screen of the portable device . Alternatively the navigation instructions may be presented on the speakers or the display of the head unit . The navigation instructions are presented during the playback stage until the user arrives at the destination.

The navigation instructions are then provided to a client device for display block . The client device may be the device from which the request for navigation instructions was received i.e. the portable device or the other computing device .

At block a selection of instruction specific presentation rules for every navigation instruction are received. The method then repeats block until an instruction specific presentation rule has been received for every navigation instruction block . In some embodiments multiple presentation rules for a single navigation instruction are received. Moreover in some embodiments when the user does not select a presentation rule for a navigation instruction a default rule is automatically received as mentioned above. In this case the method may repeat block until receiving confirmation from the user that all selections have been made e.g. by receiving a selection of a Submit option on the user interface . In other embodiments the method may repeat block until the user arrives at the starting point for the navigation instructions and the playback stage begins. In any event once the method receives a presentation rule for every navigation instruction a playlist corresponding to the presentation rules is stored at the portable device the navigation data server or an online storage system such as cloud storage.

Then at block the navigation instructions in accordance with the instruction specific presentation rules are provided to the portable device for playback. For example a voice announcement for a navigation instruction may be generated at the navigation data server as the user approaches a location for the maneuver corresponding to the navigation instruction.

The following additional considerations apply to the foregoing discussion. Throughout this specification plural instances may implement components operations or structures described as a single instance. Although individual operations of one or more methods are illustrated and described as separate operations one or more of the individual operations may be performed concurrently and nothing requires that the operations be performed in the order illustrated. Structures and functionality presented as separate components in example configurations may be implemented as a combined structure or component. Similarly structures and functionality presented as a single component may be implemented as separate components. These and other variations modifications additions and improvements fall within the scope of the subject matter of the present disclosure.

Additionally certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of components modules or mechanisms. Modules may constitute either software modules e.g. code stored on a machine readable medium or hardware modules. A hardware module is tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments one or more computer systems e.g. a standalone client or server computer system or one or more hardware modules of a computer system e.g. a processor or a group of processors may be configured by software e.g. an application or application portion as a hardware module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.

In various embodiments a hardware module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example a hardware module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured e.g. as a special purpose processor such as a field programmable gate array FPGA or an application specific integrated circuit ASIC to perform certain operations. A hardware module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry e.g. as encompassed within a general purpose processor or other programmable processor that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry or in temporarily configured circuitry e.g. configured by software may be driven by cost and time considerations.

Accordingly the term hardware should be understood to encompass a tangible entity be that an entity that is physically constructed permanently configured e.g. hardwired or temporarily configured e.g. programmed to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured e.g. programmed each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example where the hardware modules comprise a general purpose processor configured using software the general purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor for example to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.

Hardware and software modules can provide information to and receive information from other hardware and or software modules. Accordingly the described hardware modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware or software modules exist contemporaneously communications may be achieved through signal transmission e.g. over appropriate circuits and buses that connect the hardware or software modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules or software are configured or instantiated at different times communications between such hardware or software modules may be achieved for example through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware or software modules have access. For example one hardware or software module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware or software module may then at a later time access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware and software modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices and can operate on a resource e.g. a collection of information .

The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed at least partially by one or more processors that are temporarily configured e.g. by software or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured such processors may constitute processor implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may in some example embodiments comprise processor implemented modules.

Similarly the methods or routines described herein may be at least partially processor implemented. For example at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or processors or processor implemented hardware modules. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors not only residing within a single machine but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments the processor or processors may be located in a single location e.g. within a home environment an office environment or as a server farm while in other embodiments the processors may be distributed across a number of locations.

The one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a cloud computing environment or as an SaaS. For example as indicated above at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers as examples of machines including processors these operations being accessible via a network e.g. the Internet and via one or more appropriate interfaces e.g. APIs .

The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors not only residing within a single machine but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments the one or more processors or processor implemented modules may be located in a single geographic location e.g. within a home environment an office environment or a server farm . In other example embodiments the one or more processors or processor implemented modules may be distributed across a number of geographic locations.

Some portions of this specification are presented in terms of algorithms or symbolic representations of operations on data stored as bits or binary digital signals within a machine memory e.g. a computer memory . These algorithms or symbolic representations are examples of techniques used by those of ordinary skill in the data processing arts to convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. As used herein an algorithm or a routine is a self consistent sequence of operations or similar processing leading to a desired result. In this context algorithms routines and operations involve physical manipulation of physical quantities. Typically but not necessarily such quantities may take the form of electrical magnetic or optical signals capable of being stored accessed transferred combined compared or otherwise manipulated by a machine. It is convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to such signals using words such as data content bits values elements symbols characters terms numbers numerals or the like. These words however are merely convenient labels and are to be associated with appropriate physical quantities.

Unless specifically stated otherwise discussions herein using words such as processing computing calculating determining presenting displaying or the like may refer to actions or processes of a machine e.g. a computer that manipulates or transforms data represented as physical e.g. electronic magnetic or optical quantities within one or more memories e.g. volatile memory non volatile memory or a combination thereof registers or other machine components that receive store transmit or display information.

As used herein any reference to one embodiment or an embodiment means that a particular element feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. The appearances of the phrase in one embodiment in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.

Some embodiments may be described using the expression coupled and connected along with their derivatives. For example some embodiments may be described using the term coupled to indicate that two or more elements are in direct physical or electrical contact. The term coupled however may also mean that two or more elements are not in direct contact with each other but yet still co operate or interact with each other. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

As used herein the terms comprises comprising includes including has having or any other variation thereof are intended to cover a non exclusive inclusion. For example a process method article or apparatus that comprises a list of elements is not necessarily limited to only those elements but may include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to such process method article or apparatus. Further unless expressly stated to the contrary or refers to an inclusive or and not to an exclusive or. For example a condition A or B is satisfied by any one of the following A is true or present and B is false or not present A is false or not present and B is true or present and both A and B are true or present .

In addition use of the a or an are employed to describe elements and components of the embodiments herein. This is done merely for convenience and to give a general sense of the description. This description should be read to include one or at least one and the singular also includes the plural unless it is obvious that it is meant otherwise.

Upon reading this disclosure those of skill in the art will appreciate still additional alternative structural and functional designs for presenting navigation directions based on a user playlist through the disclosed principles herein. Thus while particular embodiments and applications have been illustrated and described it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are not limited to the precise construction and components disclosed herein. Various modifications changes and variations which will be apparent to those skilled in the art may be made in the arrangement operation and details of the method and apparatus disclosed herein without departing from the spirit and scope defined in the appended claims.
