Wireless mobile communication technology uses various standards and protocols to transmit data between a base transceiver station BTS and a wireless mobile device. In the third generation partnership project 3GPP long term evolution LTE systems the BTS is a combination of evolved Node Bs eNode Bs or eNBs and Radio Network Controllers RNCs in a Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network UTRAN which communicates with the wireless mobile device known as a user equipment UE . Data is transmitted from the eNode B to the UE via a physical downlink shared channel PDSCH . A physical downlink control channel PDCCH is used to transfer downlink control information DCI that informs the UE about resource allocations or scheduling related to downlink resource assignments on the PDSCH uplink resource grants and uplink power control commands. The PDCCH can be transmitted prior to the PDSCH in each subframe transmitted from the eNode B to the UE.

Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.

Before the present invention is disclosed and described it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures process steps or materials disclosed herein but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular examples only and is not intended to be limiting. The same reference numerals in different drawings represent the same element.

An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. The following definitions are provided for clarity of the overview and embodiments described below.

A system and method is provided for allocating a physical downlink control channel PDCCH to reduce a number of PDCCH candidates in a search space for carrier aggregation on a user equipment UE . A control channel element CCE aggregation level is selected for a PDCCH allocation for each of a plurality of user equipments UEs at an evolved NodeB eNB . A transmission mode is identified for each of a plurality of component carriers CCs associated with the PDCCH at the eNB. Each CC s downlink control information DCI is assigned into CCEs in a PDCCH search space starting at a CCE location based on the CC s transmission mode and the CCE aggregation level for the UE receiving the CC. The eNode B can provide the allocation of the PDCCH and assignment of the CCEs to a search space using a transmission mode to create more search spaces for the CCs of the UE. Using the transmission mode can generate up to eight additional search space starting locations by partitioning the search space. The UE may use the carrier index CI or the DCI size along with the transmission mode to assign the CCEs to a PDCCH search space.

After the CCEs are assigned to a PDCCH search space the PDCCH can be transmitted to a UE. At the UE the PDCCH can be searched by the UE for each of the UE s CC s DCI. The UE may use the transmission mode the carrier index CI and or the DCI size to efficiently search smaller PDCCH search spaces in the PDCCH.

Data in wireless mobile communication can be transmitted on the physical PHY layer by the eNode B also commonly denoted as an enhanced Node B evolved Node B or eNB to the user equipment UE using a generic long term evolution LTE frame structure as illustrated in . A radio frame of a signal used to transmit the data is configured to have a duration T of 10 milliseconds ms . Each radio frame can be segmented or divided into ten subframes that are each 1 ms long. Each subframe can be further subdivided into two slots and each with a duration T of 0.5 ms. The first slot 0 can include a physical downlink control channel PDCCH and a physical downlink shared channel PDSCH and the second slot 1 can include data using the PDSCH. Each slot for a component carrier CC used by the eNode B and the UE can include multiple resource blocks RBs and based on the CC frequency bandwidth. Each RB can include twelve 15 kHz subcarriers on the frequency axis and 6 or 7 orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM symbols on the time axis per subcarrier. The RB uses seven OFDM symbols if a short or normal cyclic prefix is employed. The RB uses six OFDM symbols if an extended cyclic prefix is used. The resource block can be mapped to 84 resource elements REs using short or normal cyclic prefixing or the resource block can be mapped to 72 REs not shown using extended cyclic prefixing. The RE can be a unit of one OFDM symbol by one subcarrier i.e. 15 kHz . Each RE can transmit two bits and of information in case of quadrature phase shift keying QPSK modulation. Other types of modulation may be used as well. For instance when bi phase shift keying BPSK modulation is used then only a single bit of information is transmitted.

In carrier aggregation CA CCs for a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network can be combined together to form a larger bandwidth for the UE as illustrated in . For example the UMTS may have a system bandwidth of 100 MHz in a frequency spectrum with each CC having a 20 MHz bandwidth. Each CC may comprise a plurality of subcarriers . Some UEs may use the entire 100 MHz system bandwidth by aggregating five 20 MHz CCs together to achieve a 100 MHz UE bandwidth . In another example two UEs and each with a 40 MHz bandwidth capability may each use two 20 MHz CCs together to achieve a 40 MHz UE bandwidth for each UE. In another example each UE and may use a single 20 MHz CC to achieve a 20 MHz UE bandwidth . The CCs at an eNode B may be aggregated for some UEs while other UEs may use a single CC during the same interval. For example one UE with a 40 MHz bandwidth may be configured while three UEs that each use a single 20 MHz CC are employed in a 100 MHz bandwidth system not shown . Carrier aggregation allows the bandwidth for a UE to be adjusted and adapted based on the system limitations the UEs capabilities and bandwidth requirements the bandwidth available to the system and or loading on the system.

Each UMTS may use a different carrier bandwidth as illustrated in . For example the LTE Release 8 Rel 8 carrier bandwidths and Release 10 Rel 10 CC bandwidths can include 1.4 MHz 3 MHz 5 MHz 10 MHz 15 MHz and 20 MHz . The 1.4 MHz CC can include 6 RBs comprising 72 subcarriers. The 3 MHz CC can include 15 RBs comprising 180 subcarriers. The 5 MHz CC can include 25 RBs comprising 300 subcarriers. The 10 MHz CC can include 50 RBs comprising 600 subcarriers. The 15 MHz CC can include 75 RBs comprising 900 subcarriers. The 20 MHz CC can include 100 RBs comprising 1200 subcarriers.

Each subframe of a CC may include downlink control information DCI found in a PDCCH as illustrated in . The PDCCH in the control region may include one to three columns of the first OFDM symbols in each subframe or RB. The remaining 11 to 13 OFDM symbols in the subframe may be allocated to the PDSCH for data. The control region can include Physical Control Format Indicator Channel PCFICH physical hybrid automatic repeat request hybrid ARQ indicator channel PHICH and the PDCCH. The control region has a flexible control design to avoid unnecessary overhead. The number of OFDM symbols in the control region used for the PDCCH can be determined by the control channel format indicator CFI transmitted in the Physical Control Format Indicator Channel PCFICH . The PCFICH is located in the first OFDM symbol of each subframe. The PCFICH and PHICH can have priority over the PDCCH so the PCFICH and PHICH are scheduled prior to the PDCCH.

The CFI and the PDCCH can be illustrated by the example of . Subframe A including slot 0 and slot 1 has a CFI equal to one indicating the first column of OFDM symbols in a CC s subframe A are used for the PDCCH and the remaining 13 columns of OFDM symbols in short cyclic prefixing are used for the PDSCH . Each CC includes a plurality of subcarriers mapped to a plurality of RBs. Subframe B has a CFI equal to three indicating the first three columns of OFDM symbols in a CC s subframe B are used for PDCCH and the remaining 11 columns of OFDM symbols in short cyclic prefixing are used for PDSCH . Subframe C has a CFI equal to two indicating the first two columns of OFDM symbols in a CC s subframe C are used for PDCCH and the remaining 12 columns of OFDM symbols in short cyclic prefixing are used for PDSCH . In the example illustrated in the subframe A is followed by subframe B and subframe C in time .

DCI can be mapped to the PDCCH using resource element groups REGs except both the PCFICH and PHICH as illustrated in . REGs can be used for defining the mapping of control channels to resource elements. A RB may include reference signal REs reference signal OFDM symbols used for transmitting reference signals for a specific antenna port and unused REs unused OFDM symbols not used for transmission on the specific port which allow other antenna ports to transmit their reference signals. The number of reference signal REs and unused REs used in the RB can depend on the number of antenna ports. REGs can be used to map control channels to the remaining resource elements. REGs include a symbol quadruplet or four REs that do not include reference signal REs.

For example a two antenna port configured RB with a CFI 3 can include seven REGs in the control region or seven REGs used for the PDCCH if no REGs are used for PCFICH and PHICH as illustrated in . A four antenna port configured RB with a CFI 3 can include six REGs in the control region or six REGs used for the PDCCH if no REGs are used for PCFICH and PHICH as illustrated in . The REGs in the control region of the RBs for a CC can comprise the PDCCH. Each CCE used in the PDCCH can include 9 REGs. The PDCCH can be formed with one or more successive CCEs. A plurality of PDCCHs can be transmitted in a single subframe.

The PDCCH in the control region of a subframe can provide DCI that informs the UE about scheduling on a CC related to downlink resource assignments on the PDSCH uplink resource grants and uplink power control commands. Each CC can provide scheduling in the PDCCH in the control region for the data in the PDSCH as illustrated in . A PDCCH in the control region for CC 1 on CC 1 can provide the scheduling for a PDSCH for CC 1 in a subframe . A PDCCH in the control region for CC 2 on CC 2 can provide the scheduling for a PDSCH for CC2. A PDCCH in the control region for CC 3 on CC 3 can provide the scheduling for a PDSCH for CC3. The subframes and for the CC 1 CC 2 and CC 3 may represent the same time duration. Each CC can provide its own PDCCH for the PDSCH scheduling.

In another example one CC can provide the PDCCH for scheduling downlink resource assignments on the PDSCH of another CC as illustrated in . The DCI of one CC can be included or mapped to another CC s PDCCH. For example the control region for CC 1 the control region for CC 2 and the control region for CC 3 can be contained in the PDCCH on CC 1 . The control region for CC 1 provides the scheduling for the PDSCH on CC 1 the control region for CC 2 provides the scheduling for the PDSCH on CC 2 and the control region for CC 3 provides the scheduling for the PDSCH on CC 3. 3GPP LTE systems can provide for cross carrier scheduling of the PDSCH where the PDCCH is transmitted on a CC different from the CC transmitting the PDSCH.

The eNode B may schedule the CCEs in the PDCCH and code the DCI based on a predetermined process and the UE may receive the transmission and may search for the DCI in the PDCCH and decode the DCI based on the predetermined process. The PDCCH can be formed with one or more successive CCEs. The total number of CCEs in the PDCCH can vary in every subframe k where k 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 of a radio frame. The number of CCEs in the PDCCH can be represented by N.

For example the PDCCH can include 86 CCEs as illustrated in . Each CCE may include nine REGs and . Each REG may include four REs and

The PDCCH can provide control information to multiple UEs in a cell for each subframe k. The UE can perform blind decoding since the UE may be aware of the detailed control channel structure including the number of control channels CCHs and the number of CCEs to which each control channel is mapped. Multiple PDCCHs can be transmitted in a single subframe k which may or may not be relevant to a particular UE. Because the UE does not know the precise location of the DCI information in a PDCCH the UE searches and decodes the CCEs in the PDCCH until the DCI is found for the UE s CCs. The PDCCH can be referred to as a search space. The UE finds the PDCCH specific to the UE or the UE s CCs by monitoring a set of PDCCH candidates a set of consecutive CCEs on which the PDCCH could be mapped in a PDCCH search space in each subframe.

The UE can use a Radio Network Temporary Identifier RNTI assigned to the UE by the eNode B to try and decode candidates. The RNTI can be used to demask a PDCCH candidate s cyclic redundancy check CRC that was originally masked by the eNode B using the UE s RNTI. If the PDCCH is for a specific UE the CRC can be masked with a UE unique identifier for example a Cell RNTI C RNTI . If no CRC error is detected the UE can determine that a PDCCH candidate carries the DCI for the UE. If a CRC error is detected then the UE can determine that PDCCH candidate does not carry the DCI for the UE and the UE can increment to the next PDCCH candidate. The UE may increment to the next PDCCH candidate in the search space based on the CCE aggregation level. The CCE aggregation level will be discussed more fully in the following paragraphs.

To reduce the burden and improve the process performance of the UE the PDCCH can be composed of a search space within the PDCCH to improve searching and decoding of the PDCCH candidates. Each search space can have a starting address determined by the RNTI. The PDCCH can be divided into a common search space which can provide scheduling information for system information received by a group of UEs in a cell and a UE specific space allocated to control information for a particular UE. The common search space can be composed of the first 16 CCEs CCE through CCE the remaining CCEs may to allocated to the UE specific space .

The number of CCEs used to transmit one piece of control information can be determined according to the receiving quality of the PDCCH allocated to a UE or the channel quality of the UE and the number of CCEs is referred to as a CCE aggregation level or an aggregation level L 1 2 4 8. The aggregation level can be used to determine the size of a search space or the number of CCEs forming a search space and or the number of control channel CCH candidates in a search space as illustrated in table of .

In another example if a search space includes 8 CCEs and the total number of CCH candidates that can be decoded may be 15. Eight CCH candidates and can represent the candidates that can be decoded with an aggregation level of one L 1 . The UE can increment through the search space by the aggregation level until the DCI for the CCs of the UE is found. Four CCH candidates and can represent the candidates that can be decoded with an aggregation level of two L 2 . Two CCH candidates and can represent the candidates that can be decoded with an aggregation level of four L 4 . One CCH candidate can represent the candidates that can be decoded with an aggregation level of eight L 8 . Searching and decoding the CCH candidates PDCCH candidates for the DCI in each subframe can be referred to as blind decoding.

Each decode takes a certain amount of time to process. The UE may have a limited number of blind decodes for the candidates in the PDCCH available in the timeframe allotted for decoding before the PDSCH or next subframe is transmitted for processing. For example a UE may be able to handle up to 44 blind decodes before the PDSCH or next subframe is transmitted for processing. When the number e.g. 300 of CCH candidates for an aggregation level is greater than a blind decode limit for the UE then the UE may fail to obtain the CCH information and fail to process the PDSCH. Reducing the number of potential search spaces can be used to assist the UE to find and decode the DCI in the PDCCH efficiently and within an available time limit.

The 3GPP transport stream TS 36.2211 V8.4.0 defines a PDCCH allocation procedure for a search space S. A starting address of a UE specific search space that contains the DCI for a UE can be allocated by Equation 1 defined based on an aggregation level L 1 2 4 8 where Yis defined by Equation 2 Nis the total number of CCEs in a ksubframe k 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 i 0 . . . L 1 is a constant m 0 . . . M 1 and Mis the number of PDCCH candidates to monitor in a given search space. mod Equation 1 

The variable Yis defined by Equation 2 where Y n 0 nis the RNTI number assigned to a UE A 39827 D 65537 k n 2 and n n 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 is the slot number within the radio frame. mod Equation 2 

The 3GPP TS 36.2211 V8.4.0 assignment procedure does not involve CC aggregation. 3GPP Rel 8 and Rel 9 do not support the scheduling of cross carriers and the UE is allocated one C RNTI in CC aggregation. Using the RNTI and aggregation level of a UE maps the DCI of a UE to a single UE search space. As UE bandwidths increase the number of PDCCH increase the number of CCs increase and the PDCCH search space sizes increase then the number of decodes used to successfully decode PDCCH candidates will increase.

Instead of using a single search space for a UE the search spaces may be further partitioned to decrease the search space size for a CC on a UE to reduce the number of blind decodes of PDCCH candidates and allow more efficient decoding of PDCCH candidates. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention the starting address of a UE specific search space can utilize the partial or full combinations of the transmission TX modes T for a carrier c the carrier index CI in the DCI format and the DCI size S of different cross carriers. The total possible number of search spaces created using the method can be a product of the transmission TX modes T for a carrier c the carrier index CI in the DCI format and the DCI size S .

The eNode B can identify at least one value associated with each CC s PDCCH where the at least one value represents at least one of a transmission mode for the CC the carrier index in the DCI format and or the DCI size. The eNode B can assign or map the CC s control information e.g. DCI into CCEs in a search space based on the at least one value associated with the CC. The UE can receive the transmitted control channel e.g. PDCCH from the eNode B. The UE can search for the selected CC s control information in a search space using the CC s value and the CCE aggregation level for the UE receiving the selected CC. The UE can decode each control channel candidate in the search space until a validly decoded control channel candidate is decoded or until all validly decoded control channel candidates in a search space are decoded. The CC s control information such as the DCI may be obtained from the validly decoded control channel candidate.

In one embodiment the eNode B can signal the transmission mode to the UE via a layer three communication link such as Radio Resource Control RRC signaling in advance of sending the PDCCH for a subframe. The transmission modes for PDSCH reception can include 8 modes Mode 1 single antenna port port 0 mode 2 transmit diversity mode 3 large delay Cyclic Delay Diversity CDD mode 4 closed loop spatial multiplexing mode 5 multi user multiple input and multiple output MU MIMO mode 6 closed loop spatial multiplexing single layer mode 7 single antenna port UE specific reference signal RS port 5 and mode 8 single or dual layer transmission with UE specific RS ports 7 and or 8 . The transmission mode can be changed per subframe via RRC signaling. Usually the transmission changes slowly. Changes in the transmission mode may be based on changes in the environment that the UE is operating. Each CC used by the UE can have independent transmission modes from other CCs. For a system with eight available transmission modes up to eight additional search spaces for each UE may be partitioned using the transmission modes for scheduling and searching. The DCI size which can also be used for scheduling and searching can be related to transmission modes and can be determined from the transmission mode.

The carrier index CI can be CIF values or the index of sorted CIF values at the ascending order. The eNode B can configure the CIF values of each CC to UE via Radio Resource Control RRC signaling prior to the transmission of the PDCCH for the subframe. The CI can change depending on RRC reconfiguration. Other information transmitted by RRC signaling may also be used for scheduling and searching PDCCH search spaces.

The variable Ycan be modified to utilize at least one of the transmission modes T the carrier index CI and or the DCI size S input parameters for the search space. Using an existing PDCCH assignment procedure and the transmission modes T Ycan be defined by Equation 3 to increase the number of starting addresses for search spaces based on the transmission mode where Y n 0 A 39827 D 65537 k n 2 and nis the slot number within the radio frame. mod Equation 3 

The f T can be a function of transmission modes for a carrier c . The carrier c can be a CC used by the UE. The f T can be an integer based on the transmission modes T . Equation 3 can be used to distinguish individual PDCCH search spaces for the different CCs in carrier aggregation. Equation 3 can specify that the PDCCHs with the same transmission modes can be located in a shared search space and the PDCCHs having different transmission modes can be located in an different shared search space. The DCI for a carrier may be allocated and mapped by an eNode B to CCEs in the PDCCH based on the transmission mode.

For example the PDCCH on a subframe for multiple CCs may be transmitted by CC 1 referred to as PDCCH1 as illustrated in . A first transmission mode search space starting location for a 1st transmission mode 940 on an independent search space on PDCCH1 may be calculated to be at a CCE location x . The independent search space on PDCCH1 may have N CCEs N for a subframe k .

A PDCCH for CC 1 with the first transmission mode may be assigned to the first transmission mode search space beginning at the CCE location x. The PDCCH for CC 1 can provide the PDSCH scheduling for CC 1. A PDCCH for CC 2 with the first transmission mode may be assigned to the first transmission mode search space at a CCE location after the PDCCH for CC 1. The PDCCH for CC 2 can provide the PDSCH scheduling for CC 2.

In one embodiment the PDCCHs may be scheduled in a search space based on the order in which the PDCCHs are processed by an eNode B and not necessarily based on a CC number or the RNTI. In another embodiment the PDCCHs with the same transmission mode may be assigned to a search space in any order determined by the eNode B.

A second transmission mode search space starting location for a second transmission mode 942 on the independent search space on PDCCH1 may be calculated to be at a CCE location s . A PDCCH for CC 3 having the second transmission mode may be assigned to the second transmission mode search space beginning at the CCE location s. The PDCCH for CC 2 can provide the PDSCH scheduling for CC 3. A third transmission mode search space starting location for a third transmission mode 944 on the independent search space on PDCCH1 may be calculated to be at a CCE location v . A PDCCH for CC 4 with the third transmission mode may be assigned to the third transmission mode search space beginning at the CCE location v. The PDCCH for CC 4 can provide the PDSCH scheduling for CC 4. A fourth transmission mode search space with a starting location for a fourth transmission mode on the independent search space on PDCCH1 may be calculated to be at a CCE location y when a PDCCH for a fourth transmission mode is used. In the illustration of the PDCCHs for the CCs have an aggregation level of two. The first transmission mode the second transmission mode the third transmission mode and the fourth transmission mode does not refer to a mode 1 a mode 2 a mode 3 a mode 4 but the terms first second third and fourth are used to distinguish between the available transmission mode that is used.

The UE may search the independent search space on PDCCH1 for the PDCCH for each CC using the existing PDCCH searching procedure and the transmission modes T . The transmission mode for a CC can be transmitted to the UE by RRC signaling prior to the subframe transmission. The PDCCH for CC 1 can be searched in the first transmission mode search space until the DCI for the CC 1 is validly decoded. Likewise the PDCCH for CC 2 can be searched in the first transmission mode search space the PDCCH for CC 3 can be searched in the second transmission mode search space and the PDCCH for CC 3 can be searched in the third transmission mode search space .

In another example the PDCCH for a subframe for multiple CCs may be transmitted by CC 1 referred to as PDCCH1 as illustrated in . A same transmission mode search space starting location for a same transmission mode 1040 as CC 1 on an independent search space on PDCCH1 may be calculated to be at a CCE location x . The independent search space on PDCCH1 may have N CCEs N for a subframe k . A PDCCH for CC 1 with the same transmission mode as CC 1 may be assigned to the same transmission mode search space beginning at the CCE location x. The PDCCH for CC 1 can provide the PDSCH scheduling for CC 1.

A first PDCCH for CC 2 with the same transmission mode as CC 1 may be assigned to the same transmission mode search space at a CCE location after the PDCCH for CC 1 such as x 2 in this example. The first PDCCH for CC 2 can provide the first PDSCH scheduling for CC 2. A first different transmission mode search space starting location for a first different transmission mode 1042 that is different from the transmission mode of CC 1 on the independent search space on PDCCH1 may be calculated to be at a CCE location s . A second PDCCH for CC 2 with the first different transmission mode may be assigned to the first different transmission mode search space beginning at the CCE location s. The second PDCCH for CC 2 can provide the second PDSCH scheduling for CC 2.

A second different transmission mode search space having a starting location for a second different transmission mode 1044 that is different from the transmission mode of CC 1 on the independent search space on PDCCH1 may be calculated to start at a CCE location v . A PDCCH for CC 3 with the second different transmission mode may be assigned to the second different transmission mode search space beginning at the CCE location v . The PDCCH for CC 3 may have an aggregation level of four. The PDCCH for CC 3 can provide the PDSCH scheduling for CC 3.

The variable Ycan be modified to utilize the transmission modes T and the carrier index CI input parameters to further segment the search space. Using an existing PDCCH assignment procedure the transmission modes T and the carrier index CI Ycan be defined by equation 4 to increase the number of starting addresses for search spaces based on the transmission mode and CI where Y n 0 A 39827 D 65537 k n 2 and nis the slot number within the radio frame. mod Equation 4 

The f CI T can be a function of transmission modes for a carrier c and the carrier index CI in the DCI formats. The f CI T can be an integer based on the transmission modes T and the carrier index CI . The DCI for a carrier may be allocated and mapped by an eNode B to CCEs in the PDCCH based on the transmission mode and the carrier index.

For example the PDCCH on a subframe for multiple CCs may be transmitted by CC 1 referred to as PDCCH1 as illustrated in . A same transmission mode and carrier index search space starting location for a same transmission mode and carrier index as CC 1 on an independent search space on PDCCH1 may be calculated to be at a CCE location x . The independent search space on PDCCH1 may have N CCEs N for a subframe k . A first PDCCH for CC 1 with the same transmission mode and carrier index as CC 1 may be assigned to the same transmission mode and carrier index search space beginning at the CCE location x. The first PDCCH for CC 1 can provide the first PDSCH scheduling for CC 1. A second PDCCH for CC 1 with the same transmission mode and carrier index as CC 1 may be assigned to the same transmission mode and carrier index search space at the CCE location after the first PDCCH for CC 1. The second PDCCH for CC 1 can provide the second PDSCH scheduling for CC 1.

A first different transmission mode and or carrier index search space starting location for a first different transmission mode and or carrier index different from the transmission mode and or carrier index of CC 1 on the independent search space on PDCCH1 may be calculated to be at a CCE location j . A first PDCCH for CC 2 with the different transmission mode and or carrier index as CC 1 may be assigned to the first different transmission mode and or carrier index search space beginning at the CCE location j. The first PDCCH for CC 2 can provide the first PDSCH scheduling for CC 2. A second PDCCH for CC 2 with the first different transmission mode and or carrier index may be assigned to the first different transmission mode and or carrier index search space at the CCE location after the first PDCCH for CC 2. The second PDCCH for CC 2 can provide the second PDSCH scheduling for CC 2.

A second different transmission mode and or carrier index search space starting location for a second different transmission mode and or carrier index different from the transmission mode and or carrier index of CC 1 on the independent search space on PDCCH1 may be calculated to be at a CCE location g . A first PDCCH for CC 3 with the second transmission mode and or carrier index may be assigned to the second transmission mode and or carrier index search space beginning at the CCE location g. The first PDCCH for CC 3 can provide the first PDSCH scheduling for CC 3. A second PDCCH for CC 3 with the second different transmission mode and or carrier index may be assigned to the second different transmission mode and or carrier index search space at the CCE location after the first PDCCH for CC 3. The second PDCCH for CC 3 can provide the second PDSCH scheduling for CC 3. In the illustration of the PDCCHs for the CCs have an aggregation level of two.

The variable Ycan be modified to utilize the transmission modes T the carrier index CI and the DCI size S input parameters for the search space. Using an existing PDCCH assignment procedure the transmission modes T the carrier index CI and the DCI size S Ycan be defined by Equation 5 to increase the number of starting addresses for a search spaces based on the transmission mode CI and S where Y n 0 A 39827 D 65537 k n 2 and nis the slot number within the radio frame. mod Equation 5 

The f CI T S can be a function of transmission modes Tfor a carrier c the carrier index CI in the DCI formats and the DCI size S . The f CI T S can be an integer based on the transmission modes T the carrier index CI and the DCI size S . The DCI for a carrier may be allocated and mapped by an eNode B to CCEs in the PDCCH based on the transmission mode the carrier index and the DCI size.

For example the PDCCH for a subframe on multiple CCs may be transmitted by CC 1 referred to as PDCCH1 as illustrated in . A same transmission mode carrier index and DCI size search space starting location for a same transmission mode carrier index and DCI size as CC 1 on an independent search space on PDCCH1 may be calculated to be at a CCE location x . The independent search space on PDCCH1 may have N CCEs N for a subframe k . A first PDCCH for CC 1 with the same transmission mode carrier index and DCI size as CC 1 may be assigned to the same transmission mode carrier index and DCI size search space beginning at the CCE location x. The first PDCCH for CC 1 can provide the first PDSCH scheduling for CC 1. A second PDCCH for CC 1 with the same transmission mode carrier index and DCI size as CC 1 may be assigned to the same transmission mode carrier index and DCI size search space at the CCE location after the first PDCCH for CC 1. The second PDCCH for CC 1 can provide the second PDSCH scheduling for CC 1.

A first different transmission mode carrier index and or DCI size search space starting location for a first different transmission mode carrier index and or DCI size different from the transmission mode and or carrier index of CC 1 on the independent search space on PDCCH1 may be calculated to be at a CCE location j . A first PDCCH for CC 2 with the different transmission mode carrier index and or DCI size as CC 1 may be assigned to the first different transmission mode carrier index and or DCI size search space beginning at the CCE location j. The first PDCCH for CC 2 can provide the first PDSCH scheduling for CC 2. A second PDCCH for CC 2 with the first different transmission mode carrier index and or DCI size may be assigned to the first different transmission mode carrier index and or DCI size search space at the CCE location after the first PDCCH for CC 2. The second PDCCH for CC 2 can provide the second PDSCH scheduling for CC 2.

A second different transmission mode carrier index and or DCI size search space starting location for a second different transmission mode carrier index and or DCI size different from the transmission mode and or carrier index of CC 1 on the independent search space on PDCCH1 may be calculated to be at a CCE location g . A first PDCCH for CC 3 with the second transmission mode carrier index and or DCI size may be assigned to the second transmission mode carrier index and or DCI size search space beginning at the CCE location g. The first PDCCH for CC 3 can provide the first PDSCH scheduling for CC 3. A second PDCCH for CC 3 with the second different transmission mode carrier index and or DCI size may be assigned to the second different transmission mode carrier index and or DCI size search space at the CCE location after the first PDCCH for CC 3. The second PDCCH for CC 3 can provide the second PDSCH scheduling for CC 3. In the illustration of the PDCCHs for the CCs have an aggregation level of two.

In another example illustrated by an eNode B includes a coding unit and a scheduling unit . The coding unit may map the PDCCH bits from a DCI message after performing CRC attachment using each UE s RNTI and channel coding and rate matching. The scheduling unit may use the UE s RNTI the UE s aggregation level the transmission mode for each of the UE s CC the carrier index for each of the UE s CC and or the DCI size to schedule the CCEs of a PDCCH in a search space. The PDCCH can then be transmitted to the UEs. The UEs and can have a searching unit and and a decoding unit and respectively for blind decoding a PDCCH search space. Each UE may use the UE s RNTI and assigned by the eNode B to de mask or decode the PDCCH candidates in a search space.

Another example provides a method for allocating a PDCCH to reduce a number of PDCCH candidates in a search space for carrier aggregation on a UE as shown in the flow chart in . The method includes the operation of selecting a control channel element CCE aggregation level for a PDCCH allocation for each of a plurality of UEs at an eNode B. The operation of identifying a transmission mode for each of a plurality of CCs associated with the PDCCH at the eNode B follows. The next operation of the method may be assigning each CC s DCI into CCEs in a PDCCH search space in the PDCCH starting at a CCE location based on the CC s transmission mode and the CCE aggregation level for the UE receiving the CC.

The method and system for allocating a PDCCH to reduce a number of PDCCH candidates in a search space for carrier aggregation on a UE may be implemented using a computer readable medium having executable code embodied on the medium. The computer readable program code may be configured to provide the functions described in the method. The computer readable medium may be a RAM EPROM flash drive optical drive magnetic hard drive or other medium for storing electronic data. Additionally the method and system for allocating a PDCCH to reduce a number of PDCCH candidates in a search space for carrier aggregation on a UE may be downloaded as a computer program product transferred from a server or eNode B to a requesting or wireless device by way of machine readable data signals embodied in a carrier wave or other propagation medium.

Various techniques or certain aspects or portions thereof may take the form of program code i.e. instructions embodied in tangible media such as floppy diskettes CD ROMs hard drives or any other machine readable storage medium wherein when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine such as a computer the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the various techniques. In the case of program code execution on programmable computers the computing device may include a processor a storage medium readable by the processor including volatile and non volatile memory and or storage elements at least one input device and at least one output device. One or more programs that may implement or utilize the various techniques described herein may use an application programming interface API reusable controls and the like. Such programs may be implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However the program s may be implemented in assembly or machine language if desired. In any case the language may be a compiled or interpreted language and combined with hardware implementations.

It should be understood that many of the functional units described in this specification have been labeled as modules in order to more particularly emphasize their implementation independence. For example a module may be implemented as a hardware circuit comprising custom VLSI circuits or gate arrays off the shelf semiconductors such as logic chips transistors or other discrete components. A module may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays programmable array logic programmable logic devices or the like.

Modules may also be implemented in software for execution by various types of processors. An identified module of executable code may for instance comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions which may for instance be organized as an object procedure or function. Nevertheless the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations which when joined logically together comprise the module and achieve the stated purpose for the module.

Indeed a module of executable code may be a single instruction or many instructions and may even be distributed over several different code segments among different programs and across several memory devices. Similarly operational data may be identified and illustrated herein within modules and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure. The operational data may be collected as a single data set or may be distributed over different locations including over different storage devices and may exist at least partially merely as electronic signals on a system or network. The modules may be passive or active including agents operable to perform desired functions.
