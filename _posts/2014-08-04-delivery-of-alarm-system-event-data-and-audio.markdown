This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 438 941 filed Apr. 4 2012 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 471 569 filed Apr. 4 2011. The entire contents of each application are hereby incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention generally relates to a system and method for efficient delivery of alarm system event data and audio over telecommunications networks.

Historically security alarm systems have relied upon the Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN to connect an alarm system to a central alarm monitoring station so that alarm event data may be communicated from the alarm system to the central alarm monitoring station. These conventional alarm systems are configured to place an audio band voice call to the central alarm monitoring station and transmit alarm event data to the central alarm monitoring station using DTMF touch tone codes for example. Alarm systems equipped with two way voice or ambient sound listening functionality have relied upon the same PSTN connection to connect a two way audio band voice call between the alarm system and the central alarm monitoring station. In this manner an agent at the central alarm monitoring station is able to listen to ambient sounds captured by microphones at the premises where the alarm system is installed via the audio band voice call. Similarly the voice of the agent is communicated via the audio band voice call and amplified by speakers and associated circuitry of the alarm system.

Some alarm systems substitute Voice over IP VoIP communications services for the PSTN. These systems also communicate both alarm event data and voice over a two way audio band voice channel established using the VoIP service. It is noted that for VoIP equipped alarm systems additional flexibility in the manner by which the alarm systems connect to central monitoring stations would be desirable. For example while conventional alarm systems are configured to establish and maintain a voice channel upon the occurrence of an alarm event the establishment of the voice channel is not evaluated by any means. In this context it would be desirable to achieve additional flexibility for alarm system monitoring service providers so that the establishment of the voice channel may be based in part upon considerations evaluated by the providers and system maintained by the providers. Additionally it would be desirable to leverage the benefits of using VoIP communications in place of the PSTN. For example it would be desirable to leverage the speed and flexibility offered by using VoIP communications.

The present invention is directed to addressing the deficiencies of and achieving improvements over the above discussed conventional systems by efficiently and flexibly delivering alarm system event data and audio.

According to additional aspects the alarm system is also configured to initiate a call to the CAMS using the TA in response to the alarm event and open a voice channel between the alarm system and the CAMS in response to the alarm event as described in further detail below. It is noted that the alarm system is configured to store a telephone number of one or more central alarm monitoring stations such as the CAMS to call when an alarm event is detected.

The TA comprises circuitry and associated firmware and or software for interfacing a standard analog voice band telephone with a VoIP network. In certain embodiments the TA includes at least a first packet based data port such as an RJ45 Ethernet port and a second voice band telephone port such as an RJ11 telephone port for example. The RJ11 telephone port provides a port for communicatively coupling the TA and the alarm system via communications link which may comprise a twisted pair of wires generally used for voice band telephone networks. The RJ45 telephone port provides a port for communicatively coupling the TA to the data network via communications link for example. In other embodiments the TA may include other standard and or non standard connectors ports and couplings for communicatively coupling to the alarm system and the data network . In embodiments where the TA is installed within a home or office building along with the alarm system the TA may be connected to the data network via one or more intermediate network modems routers and switches as would be understood in the art. In general the data network comprises a packet based private public or combination of private and public networks including for example the Internet. It is additionally noted that the data network may include combinations of both wired and wireless portions. Among other aspects the telephone adapter is configured to open a voice channel between the alarm system and the PTS based on a call initiated by the alarm system .

The MPG includes but is not limited to a communications module a processor a database and a dialer bank . The communications module is configured to communicate with other elements of the system such as the PTS for example via the communications link over the data network . In various embodiments the communications link may traverse the data network but other connections are within the scope of this disclosure. For example the communications link may be a direct wired connection or completely contained within a private packet based data network. The processor comprises a general purpose processor that directs and coordinates the functions of the MPG as described herein. As such the processor may direct and coordinate the actions and processes of the communications module and the dialer bank among other components of the MPG for example. In certain embodiments the processor may execute program instructions stored on the database or other memory devices directing the processor to perform certain processes as described in further detail below.

In one embodiment the dialer bank is configured to establish a voice channel to the CAMS via the communications link which may comprise one or more wired or wireless communications links. The dialer bank may be further configured to communicate data including alarm event data received from the alarm system to the CAMS station using DTMF signaling via the communications link . In one embodiment the communications link comprises the PSTN. In another embodiment the communications link comprises a packet based data network similar to the data network .

The database comprises one or more computer readable storage devices that store computer executable program code as well as data related to alarm systems telephone adapters accounts of alarm monitoring subscribers alarm system event data and other associated data. For example the database may store data associated with a plurality of alarm monitoring subscriber accounts for billing and other purposes. Further the database may store data associated with the hardware and software configurations of the alarm system and the TA including manufacturer serial numbers pseudo serial numbers makes models Media Access Control MAC addresses or identifiers account numbers installation addresses and service records for example. Pseudo serial numbers are described in further detail below. In certain embodiments the database may additionally store data associated with the communications protocols and methods of the alarm system and the TA such as a Session Initiation Protocol SIP username and password of the TA for example. The account data and other associated information stored in the database may be maintained and updated by account owners such as alarm services dealers. Also the MPG may communicate the information stored in the database in certain parts and aspects to the PTS and the PTS may communicate information to the MPG to be stored in the database . It is noted that the MPG provides and facilitates alarm monitoring services for a plurality of alarm systems in addition to the alarm system . In other words the system in various embodiments may include a plurality of alarm systems similar but not necessarily the same as the alarm system . Similarly the system may include a plurality of TAs similar but not necessarily the same as the TA corresponding to each of the plurality of alarm systems in addition to the alarm system . As such the database stores data related to a plurality of alarm systems and TAs in addition to the alarm system and the TA .

In operational aspects the MPG is configured to receive alarm event data from the alarm system evaluate service parameters of the alarm system and the alarm event data and send instructions to contact the CAMS if certain service parameters of the alarm system are met. Additionally the MPG is further configured to communicate alarm event data to the CAMS if the certain service parameters of the alarm system and the alarm event data are not met. In other aspects the MPG is configured to determine whether the alarm system and or the TA is provisioned at the MPG determine whether the alarm system is associated with an active customer account and determine whether the alarm system is capable and configured for a two way voice channel. A more detailed description of the operational aspects of the MPG is discussed below.

In certain aspects alarm services dealers such as dealer may access the MPG using the communications module via communication link to establish new and update existing alarm monitoring services. When accessing the MPG using the dealer computing device the dealer is able to register new customers provide account information for the new customers set service parameters for new customers and update registration account and service information and parameters for existing customers for example. Further the dealer is able to provide information to the MPG regarding provisioning new alarm systems and TAs for use with the system . In that context it is noted that when an alarm system is being updated or provisioned for monitoring service the dealer may connect to the MPG using the dealer computing device to establish the service parameters for the new installation. For example the dealer may provide specifics regarding the alarm system and the TA to the MPG . The specifics may include one or more of unique pseudo serial numbers manufacturer serial numbers and or Media Access Control addresses of the alarm system and or the TA among other information.

In one embodiment at least the pseudo serial number of the TA is provided by the dealer to the MPG when establishing new or updating existing alarm monitoring services using the TA . The pseudo serial number of the TA may be uniquely predetermined by the MPG the PTS or a combination of the MPG and the PTS for the TA and maintained with the TA for reference. That is the predetermined pseudo serial number of the TA may be unique to the TA among TAs and printed or affixed on the TA in various forms for quick reference by the dealer when contacting the MPG to provision service using the TA . As one non limiting example for context the pseudo serial number may comprise a number similar in nature to a manufacturer s serial number but starting with the letter B . The pseudo serial number of any given TA may be determined by the MPG the PTS or a combination of the MPG and the PTS based on one or more of the manufacturer s serial number make or model of the TA and may be associated with a Session Initiation Protocol SIP username and password of the TA. In certain aspects the MPG the PTS or a combination of the MPG and the PTS may predetermine pseudo serial numbers for a plurality of TAs available to the dealer for use in alarm system installations. In another embodiment one or more of the manufacturer serial number MAC address make and model of the TA is provided by the dealer to the MPG when establishing new or updating existing alarm monitoring services using the TA . In this case a pseudo serial numbers for the TA may be generated at the time the TA is provisioned for new active service.

Besides providing the specifics of the hardware to be monitored the dealer is also able to establish or update a type of alarm monitoring service for each customer serviced using the MPG . For example a new alarm monitoring service may or may not include voice monitoring in addition to data i.e. event code monitoring. Such monitoring parameters may be set by the dealer by accessing the MPG using the dealer computing device .

After receiving the specifics MPG may provision the alarm system and the TA for active alarm monitoring in connection with the PTS . In certain aspects provisioning may include communicating certain information received by the MPG from the dealer to the PTS and generating among the MPG and the PTS if not already determined beforehand a pseudo serial number for the alarm system the TA and or a combination of the alarm system and the TA . After the MPG is satisfied with all information required for provisioning the alarm system and the TA for active alarm monitoring service the MPG may communicate a message to the PTS indicating that at least the TA is provisioned for active alarm monitoring service. In some embodiments MPG may communicate a message to the PTS indicating that the TA and the alarm system are both provisioned for active alarm monitoring service.

The PTS comprises a communications module one or more proxy processors a database and at least one bank of communications modules. Particularly the PTS as illustrated includes three communications banks and . The communications module is similar to the communications module and facilitates communication over data networks such as the data network . The PTS may comprise additional or fewer communications banks among embodiments. In one embodiment the MPG and the PTS comprise separate computing devices and the PTS is communicatively coupled to the MPG via the communications link . The PTS and the MPG may communicate using Application Programming Interface API web services via the communications link using the communications modules and . In other embodiments the PTS and the MPG may be integrated as a single computing device as designated by the hashed outline . The database comprises one or more computer readable storage devices that store computer executable program code as well as data related to alarm systems telephone adapters accounts of alarm monitoring subscribers alarm system event data and other associated data. In certain aspects at least in part the database stores data similar to the data stored by the database .

The communications banks and are configured to establish a voice channel to the CAMS via the communications link which may comprise the PSTN or one or more wired or wireless communications links including the PSTN. It is noted that in certain embodiments the communications link may comprise communications links other than the PSTN including communications links that traverse the data network . As compared to the dialer bank the communications banks and may comprise additional circuitry firmware and or software. That is the dialer bank may comprise circuitry for establishing a voice channel between the MPG and the CAMS and communicating data using DTMF tones to the CAMS via the communications link but not circuitry for facilitating a two way audio band voice conversation between individuals via the communications link . Thus as compared to the dialer bank the communications banks and may comprise additional circuitry firmware and or software to facilitate two way voice communications over the voice channel established between the PTS and the CAMS via the communications link .

In operational aspects the PTS is configured to open a voice channel to the CAMS and communicate alarm event data and associated information received from the alarm system as may be modified in certain cases by the MPG to the CAMS . In additional aspects the PTS is further configured to determine whether the voice channel between the PTS and the CAMS remains open after data such as the alarm event data is communicated to the CAMS . The PTS is further configured to bridge a voice channel between the alarm system and the CAMS as described in further detail below.

The CAMS comprises at least one agent console and a plurality of receiver modules and . The central alarm monitoring station is staffed by personnel including agent . As illustrated in the agent is able to view the agent console which displays information associated with received alarm event data from alarm systems. For example after receiving alarm event data and associated information from the alarm system the agent console may display details related to an alarm event occurring at a location where the alarm system is installed. For example based on alarm event data received from the alarm system the agent console may indicate that a fire panic burglary or medical emergency is occurring at a home or office where the alarm system is installed. Additionally the agent console may display a street address or geographic coordinates of the home or office with contact information for fire police and medical services. Based on the display the agent is able to assess the event where the alarm system is installed. Generally the CAMS facilitates monitoring alarm systems installed at a plurality of locations by one or more agents that assess alarm events and sometimes contact service personnel based upon alarm event data received from the alarm systems. For example the agents monitoring alarm systems at the CAMS may call for fire police or medical service personnel to be dispatched based on alarm event data received from a plurality of monitored alarm systems.

When an alarm system includes two way voice functionality a voice channel may be established between the alarm system and the CAMS . As such the agent at the CAMS is able to listen to ambient sounds captured by microphones of an alarm system for example at a location where the alarm system is installed. The sounds may be communicated over a voice channel established between the alarm system and the CAMS . The agent is also able to speak into a handset or headset microphone for example at the CAMS and the agent s voice may be communicated over the voice channel and amplified over speakers at the location where the alarm system is installed. As described herein an alarm system comprising two way voice functionality is capable of establishing a full duplex voice band audio link between the alarm system and an alarm monitoring station. Using the two way voice functionality the agent is able to assess any ambient sounds captured at a location where an alarm system is installed in connection with received alarm event data. For example the agent may be able to hear one or more persons committing a crime in connection with alarm event data indicating a burglary event and warn those persons that police have been dispatched. In another example the agent may be able to hear an individual s request for medical assistance.

Turning again to aspects of the TA it is noted that the TA stores an address of the PTS to connect to the PTS over the data network . For example the TA may store a static Internet Protocol IP or Uniform Resource Locator URL address of the PTS . The stored address of the PTS may be pre configured for the TA by a manufacturer of the TA for example at the request of the dealer for example when purchasing the TA for use in new alarm system installations. Alternatively or additionally the TA may be configured or re configured with the stored address of the PTS by the dealer before being provided to a new alarm monitoring service customer. In operational aspects when the alarm system detects an alarm event the communications module of the TA opens a connection to the TA via the communications link . Because in certain embodiments the communications module of the alarm system is configured to communicate over wired networks such as twisted pair telephone line PSTN networks the communications module may expect to receive a telephone dial tone upon opening a connection to the TA . The TA is configured to generate a dial tone upon opening a connection via the communications link . Upon receiving the dial tone the communications module dials a telephone number of the CAMS and waits for a connection to be opened. While waiting for the connection to the opened the communications module may receive rings from the TA as would be common when placing a standard telephone call over PSTN networks.

It is noted that as compared to conventional alarm systems the system is configured to permit the alarm system to quickly open a communications link and provide alarm event data in response to the detection of an alarm event. It is noted that in certain conventional alarm systems the alarm system establishes a communications link directly to the CAMS by placing a telephone call to the CAMS via the PSTN. In that context depending upon the status of the CAMS the CAMS may or may not accept the telephone call quickly. For example the alarm system may have to wait for several rings before the CAMS answers a telephone call.

As discussed above the alarm system stores the telephone number of the CAMS and places a call to the CAMS when an alarm event is detected. However according to the configuration of the system of when the alarm system dials the telephone number of the CAMS using the TA the TA connects to the PTS and the PTS and the TA open or negotiate a voice channel among themselves on the communications link . In this context it is noted that the PTS is an intermediary between the alarm system and the CAMS . Similarly the MPG is an intermediary between the alarm system and the CAMS . In concert with the MPG the PTS adds additional flexibility in the system as compared to conventional alarm systems. For example if the alarm system were to establish a communications link directly to the CAMS the alarm system monitoring service provider of the alarm system may be limited in opportunities to intervene monitor or modify the communications between the alarm system and the CAMS . For example in certain conventional alarm systems if a customer were to change or update alarm monitoring service plans fail to maintain current account balances or cancel service the service provider may be required to connect to the alarm system via a communications link and update parameters of the alarm system or make a service call to the location whether the alarm system is installed. Based on the configuration of the system the service provider has additional options to intervene monitor or modify the communications between the alarm system and the CAMS as may be needed from time to time under various circumstances. Additionally due to the speed of the communications and processing between and among the MPG and the PTS the MPG and the PTS although intermediary between the alarm system and the CAMS may appear generally transparent for purposes of communicating alarm event data from the alarm system to the CAMS .

It is noted that even before the TA connects to the PTS to open a voice channel between the alarm system and the PTS in response to a call dialed to the CAMS by the alarm system the PTS is aware that the TA is connected to the network . Particularly when the TA is powered on the TA is configured to contact the PTS via the data network to establish that it is available and active. In turn the PTS may periodically ping the TA to determine whether the TA is still available and active for service integrity monitoring and logging. The PTS may also communicate records to the MPG indicating when the TA is available and active on the data network for monitoring and logging. Further the PTS may also communicate call detail records to the MPG detailing any inbound and outbound calls made and the respective timings and durations of those calls for monitoring and logging.

Before turning to the process flow diagrams of it is noted that the present invention may be practiced using an alternative order of the steps illustrated in . That is the process flows illustrated in are provided as examples only and the present invention may be practiced using process flows that differ from those illustrated. Additionally it is noted that not all steps are required in every embodiment. In other words one or more of the steps may be omitted or replaced without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. In alternative embodiments steps may be performed in different orders in parallel with one another or omitted entirely and or certain additional steps may be performed without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.

Turning to a method for delivering alarm system event data and connecting a two way voice channel is illustrated. The method is generally described in terms of the elements of the system but other systems within the scope of the present disclosure may perform the method . At step the alarm system detects an alarm event. For example the alarm system may detect a fire burglary or medical emergency using one or more of the sensors of the alarm subsystem or according to a button pressed on the keypad of the alarm panel . In other words the alarm event may be responsive to the sensors of the alarm system or an individual s request for attention using the alarm panel . At step the alarm system initiates a call to the CAMS using the TA . In certain aspects the initiation of the call by the alarm system to the CAMS includes the alarm system opening a connection to the TA via the communications link and receiving a standard dial tone from the TA . Upon receiving the dial tone the communications module dials a telephone number of the CAMS and waits for a connection. As noted above while waiting for the connection to the opened the alarm system may receive rings from the TA as would be common when placing a standard telephone call over PSTN networks.

As noted above the TA stores an address of the PTS so that the TA may connect to the PTS over the data network . Upon receiving the telephone number of the CAMS from the alarm system at step the TA connects to the PTS at step . That is the PTS opens a voice channel to the alarm system using the TA via communications link . In this manner the alarm system has established a voice channel between itself and the PTS . It is noted that from the standpoint of the alarm system the PTS may appear to be the CAMS . In that context as if the PTS were the CAMS the PTS may be configured to send certain protocol and connection tones to the alarm system upon establishing a voice channel to the alarm system .

After the voice channel between the alarm system and the PTS is established the alarm system communicates alarm event data to the PTS at step . For example the alarm system may communicate alarm event data representative of the alarm event detected at step to the PTS at step using one or more industry standard Contact ID format codes. The alarm system may also communicate information to the PBT in addition to the alarm event data such as an account number associated with the alarm system and or an identifier of the alarm system . The identifier may be a serial number of the alarm system a serial number of the communications module or another unique identifier associated with the alarm system .

After step the process proceeds to step where the PTS communicates the alarm event data to the MPG . That is at step the PTS communicates the alarm event data received from the alarm system and in certain cases other associated data received from the alarm system to the MPG over the data network via communications link . For example the PTS may communicate the telephone number of the CAMS as dialed by the alarm system and the account number of the alarm system to the MPG when communicating the alarm event data to the MPG . It is also noted that at step when the TA connects to the PTS to open a voice channel the TA is identified by the PTS according to its pseudo serial number and the PTS may communicate the alarm event data to the MPG along with the pseudo serial number of the TA for reference by the MPG at step .

Referring to the MPG evaluates service parameters of the alarm system and or the alarm event data received from the alarm system at step . Based on the evaluation at step the MPG determines whether to open a two way voice channel. That is at step the MPG determines whether to open the two way voice channel based on whether certain service parameters of the alarm system and or conditions of the data received from the alarm system are met as described in further detail below with reference to .

At step the MPG may modify certain data or parameters of data received from the PTS at step if necessary. It is noted that step is optional and the MPG may not modify any data received from the alarm system in certain cases where the data does not need to be modified. For example if the MPG maintains an updated or different telephone number for the CAMS associated with the alarm system in the database the MPG may replace the telephone number received from the alarm system with the updated telephone number for the CAMS . That is if the MPG maintains an updated or different telephone number for the CAMS the MPG may use the updated telephone number for all subsequent steps in the method in place of the telephone number received from the alarm system . As an additional or alternative example if the MPG maintains an updated or different account number associated with the alarm system in the database the MPG may replace the account number received from the alarm system with the updated account number for the alarm system . The MPG may also modify or replace alarm event data such as Contact ID codes if necessary in certain embodiments. In this manner as noted above the MPG provides additional flexibility in the system as compared to conventional alarm systems. For example if the alarm system were to establish a communications link directly to the CAMS the alarm system monitoring service provider of the alarm system is limited in opportunities to intervene monitor or modify the communications between the alarm system and the CAMS .

Proceeding to step if the MPG determined at step that a voice channel is not to be opened between the alarm system and the CAMS the MPG proceeds to step and places a call to the CAMS via the communications link . That is the MPG establishes a communications channel to the CAMS via communications link using the dialer bank and the receiver module at step . After establishing the communications channel at step the MPG communicates the alarm event data received from the alarm system to the CAMS at step . In one embodiment the MPG communicates the alarm event data to the CAMS using DTMF tones. It is noted that the MPG may communicate data to the central CAMS in addition to the alarm event data. For example the MPG may query the database at step to gather and or cross reference data associated with the alarm system . In turn the MPG may communicate certain additional data queried from the database to the CAMS when communicating the alarm event data to the CAMS at step .

Based on the alarm event data and any other associated information received from the MPG the agent console is updated with a display of the alarm event detected by the alarm system and the process ends at step after the CAMS has received the alarm event data. In this case no voice channel is connected between the alarm system and the CAMS . As such the agent determines whether to contact emergency personnel such as police fire or medical personnel based on the updated display of the agent console without the additional benefit of the voice channel.

Referring again to step if the MPG determined at step that a voice channel is to be opened between the alarm system and the CAMS the MPG proceeds to step and communicates alarm event data to the PTS and thus instructs the PTS to contact the CAMS . At step the MPG communicates the data to the PTS via the communications link using a web services API for example. In certain aspects the MPG communicates the data received from the PTS at step back to the PTS at step . It is noted that when the MPG communicates the alarm event data back to the PTS at step the communication serves as an instruction to the PTS to contact the CAMS . In that context along with the alarm event data the MPG may also communicate the telephone number of the CAMS received from the PTS at step back to the PTS at step .

In certain embodiments at step the MPG may communicate data back to the PTS in addition to any data received from the PTS at step . For example the MPG may query the database at step to gather and or cross reference data associated with the alarm system . In turn the MPG may communicate certain additional data queried from the database to the PTS when communicating the alarm event data to the PTS at step . Further some of the data communicated by the MPG to the PTS at step may include data that was modified or updated by the MPG at step as described above.

Proceeding to step the PTS opens a voice channel with a receiver module of the CAMS using the communications bank via the communications link . The PTS may open the voice channel with reference to the telephone number of the CAMS received from the MPG at step for example. After opening the voice channel the PTS communicates the alarm event data and in certain embodiments other associated information received from the MPG to the CAMS . In one embodiment the PTS communicates the alarm event data and an account number of the alarm system . Among embodiments the PTS may communicate any portion or all of the data received from the MPG to the CAMS at step .

At step the PTS determines whether the voice channel between the PTS and the CAMS remains open after an acknowledgement is returned from the CAMS indicating that the alarm event data has been received. In other words the PTS determines whether the CAMS has maintained an open communications channel via the communications link after the CAMS acknowledges receipt of the alarm event data from the PTS .

Referring between if the PTS determines at step that the voice channel between the PTS and the CAMS does not remain open after communication of the alarm event data to the CAMS at step the process proceeds to step where the PTS indicates to the alarm system that the CAMS has disconnected. For example the PTS may provide a PSTN busy signal to the alarm system to indicate to the alarm system that the CAMS has disconnected.

Proceeding to step the PTS and or the TA disconnects the voice channel between the alarm system and the PTS . After step the PTS communicates a call detail record to the MPG including details regarding the communications or attempted communications between the alarm system and the CAMS for logging and or debugging at step . In certain aspects it is noted that the MPG may maintain a log of the communications and attempted communications between the alarm system and the CAMS . To assist with the log the MPG uses at least in part call detail records received from the PTS at step .

Referring again between if the PTS determines at step that the CAMS maintains an open voice channel after receipt of the alarm event data the process proceeds to step where the PTS bridges the voice channel established between the alarm system and the PTS at step with the voice channel established between the PTS and the CAMS at step . Thus a voice channel between the alarm system and the CAMS is created at step . After the voice channel is bridged between the alarm system and the CAMS at step the agent is able to speak into a headset or handset microphone at the CAMS and the agent s voice may be amplified over the speakers of the alarm system . Additionally the agent is able to listen for sounds at a location where the alarm system is installed using a microphone of the alarm system . The bridged voice channel continues until it is determined to be disconnected by either the alarm system or the CAMS at step . After the bridged voice channel is disconnected in certain embodiments the PTS communicates a call detail record to the MPG including details regarding the communications between the alarm system and the CAMS for logging and or debugging at step . The process ends at step when the bridged voice channel is disconnected.

Turning to a process flow diagram of the step of evaluating service parameters of an alarm system and or alarm event data is described in further detail. Generally the evaluation is relied upon to determine whether a two way voice channel is to be opened between the alarm system and the CAMS . The decision blocks in the evaluation illustrated in are provided by way of example only and embodiments may be implemented using fewer or additional factors decisions or considerations.

At step the processor of the MPG queries data associated with the alarm system from the database . Particularly the processor queries the database for various types of data associated with the alarm system such as account numbers service parameters billing information subscriber names serial numbers IP addresses and other service parameters of the alarm system . At step the MPG evaluates the data queried from the database at step and the alarm system event data received from the PTS at step .

After the query at step and the evaluation at step the post processor determines whether a two way voice channel is to be opened at decisions blocks and . At step the processor determines whether the alarm system and or the TA are provisioned in the database . In other words the processor may determine whether the alarm system is registered among a known group of serviced alarm systems of the MPG . Similarly the processor may determine whether the TA is registered among a known group of TAs serviced by the MPG . To determine whether the alarm system is provisioned the processor may reference the serial number of the alarm system and cross reference it with information in the database . Additionally or alternatively to determine whether the TA is provisioned the processor may reference the pseudo serial number or manufacturer s serial number of the TA and cross reference it with information in the database . If the alarm system is not among the known group of serviced alarm systems of the MPG the process ends at step . Similarly if the TA is not among the known group of serviced TAs the process ends at step . It is noted that when the process ends at step no communication with the CAMS occurs although the alarm system contacted the PTS . Particularly when the process ends at step the MPG does not contact the CAMS at step and the PTS does not contact the CAMS at step . Instead the MPG fails to communicate any alarm event data back to the PTS at step and thus the PTS has no instructions to contact the CAMS . In this case the process ends without the CAMS being contacted. In general no connection between the alarm system and the CAMS is permitted or authorized by the MPG because the alarm system is not a provisioned customer. Alternatively if the alarm system is among the known serviced alarm systems the process proceeds to step .

At step the processor determines whether the alarm system is associated with an active alarm monitoring account. In other words the processor determines whether the alarm system is associated with a customer account in good standing for example. Among other aspects the standing of a customer s account may be dependent upon an account balance for services rendered or a payment schedule of the customer. If the alarm system is not associated with a customer account in good standing the processor proceeds to step and the process ends at step as described above. In this case no connection between the alarm system and the CAMS is permitted or authorized by the MPG because the alarm system is associated with a customer account that is not in good standing. Alternatively if the alarm system is associated with a customer account in good standing the process proceeds to step .

At step the processor determines whether the alarm system is capable of and configured for establishing a two way voice channel between the alarm system and the CAMS . In one aspect at step the processor determines whether the alarm system comprises the hardware necessary to facilitate the establishment of a voice channel. The processor may cross reference the pseudo serial number or manufacturer s a serial number of the alarm system with data stored in the database to determine whether the alarm system comprises the hardware required to establish a voice channel. In this context the database may store a list of hardware configurations of several different models of alarm systems which comprise the hardware necessary to establish a voice channel for reference by the processor .

In another aspect at step the processor determines whether the alarm system is configured for two way voice functionality. It is noted that although an alarm system may comprise the hardware necessary to establish a voice channel customers and or service providers may choose not to use the two way voice functionality of the alarm system. Even for alarm systems comprising the hardware necessary for establishing a voice channel the voice feature may be disabled at the alarm panel of the alarm system or according to one or more parameters stored in the database for example. As noted above the dealer may access the MPG and set or update the service parameters of the alarm system either before or after the initial installation of the alarm system . For example the dealer may access the MPG and set whether two way voice functionality is currently active for the alarm system . If the alarm system does not comprise the hardware necessary for establishing a voice channel or is not configured for two way voice functionality the processor proceeds to step and it is determined that no two way voice channel is to be opened. Alternatively if the alarm system comprises the hardware necessary for establishing a voice channel and is configured for two way voice functionality the process proceeds to step .

Thus during the evaluation illustrated in i.e. during step of the MPG determines whether to open a voice channel between the alarm system and the CAMS . As noted above the voice channel is not opened automatically for all alarm events of the alarm system . For example as discussed above even if a burglary is detected no voice channel is opened if the alarm system is not provisioned is not associated with a customer account in good standing or is not configured for two way voice functionality by the dealer . With reference again to after the evaluation in the process turns to either step when no voice channel is to be opened or to step when a voice channel is to be opened according to the decision at step.

Returning to for a discussion of aspects of an additional embodiment before proceeding from step to step the PTS may optionally determine at step whether pass through mode is set at the PTS . Particularly the PTS may be set by the MPG to operate in pass through mode. The PTS is configured if set to operate in pass through mode to communicate the alarm event data received from the alarm system directly to the CAMS without or with minimal communication with the MPG beforehand. If the PTS determines that pass through mode is enabled at step the process proceeds directly to step of where the PTS opens a voice channel to the CAMS and communicates the alarm event data received from the alarm system to the CAMS . In this case the evaluation by the MPG at step is bypassed. In some embodiments even when the PTS determines at step that pass through mode is set the PTS may still communicate certain information to the MPG . For example the PTS may still communicate the telephone number dialed by the alarm system using the TA to the MPG so that the MPG may at least determine whether the telephone number is a valid telephone number of a central alarm monitoring station. In this respect the MPG may be configured to give the PTS a reduced evaluation go or no go with regard to whether the PTS should proceed to contact the central alarm monitoring station dialed by the alarm system .

As discussed above the alarm system stores the telephone number of the CAMS and places a call to the CAMS at step when an alarm event is detected. However according to the method for delivering alarm system event data and connecting a two way voice channel when the alarm system dials the telephone number of the CAMS using the TA the TA connects to the PTS rather than to the CAMS . In this context it is noted that the steps performed by the MPG and the PTS are intermediary between any step of establishing a connection between the alarm system and the CAMS . The steps performed by the MPG and the PTS add additional flexibility to conventional methods of delivering alarm system event data. For example if the alarm system were to establish a communications link directly to the CAMS the alarm system monitoring service provider of the alarm system may be limited in opportunities to intervene monitor or modify the communications between the alarm system and the CAMS as noted above. Based on the steps of the method a service provider has additional options to intervene monitor or modify communications between the alarm system and the CAMS as may be needed from time to time under various circumstances.
