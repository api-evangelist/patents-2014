title: Secure disrupter unit for explosive ordnance disposal operations
abstract: A disrupter unit is used for explosive ordnance disposal by firing a slug into the ordnance to be destroyed. A method is shown to secure the disrupter unit to a sand bag or other stationary location during such firing of the disrupter unit. The present invention may also adapt the disrupter unit to shear wire, such as barbed wire, by attaching a wire cutter element to the disrupter unit through a robust cable during firing. Likewise, the disrupter unit may be used as a remote pull device or further to unearth a buried item via mechanical advantage, wherein a military shovel or another long rod is attached by a robust cable to the disrupter unit.

This application claims benefit under 35 USC 119 e from Provisional Patent Application No. 61 839 517 filed Jun. 26 2013 the entire file wrapper contents of which application are hereby incorporated as though fully set forth.

The inventions described herein may be made used or licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

Current disrupters used in Explosive Ordnance Disposal EOD operations are remotely fired single shot smooth bored gun tubes which propel simple slugs via specialized blank cartridges. In general these devices such as the 0.50 cal MK2 De Armer do not weigh much more than the slugs they propel and the recoil force on the disrupter is tremendous. There is currently and historically a problem with locating the disrupter after an initiation. If not properly secured a disrupter can be thrown a tremendous distance. According to one aspect of this invention by providing means for attaching a high tensile strength rope or cable to the disrupter the system can be much more easily attached to a sandbag or other weight which will prevent such recoil from propelling the disrupter rearward or in other unwanted directions.

In another aspect of the invention an operator may attach the cable to a wirecutter e.g. as well as to the sandbag or other weight and the disrupter can also or simultaneously be used as a remote wire cutting tool. In this mode the force of the recoiling disrupter and its attached wire cutter will shear through whatever wire it had been pre positioned to cut.

In yet another aspect of the invention the cable maybe attached to a military shovel e.g. or another long rod which can use the recoiling force of the disrupter to unearth a buried item via mechanical advantage. In this way the disrupter can also or simultaneously be used as a remote pull tool.

The disrupter is fashioned with metal wings or ears cast into the disrupter s housing or onto the disrupter s screw in parts such as a breech plug. The ears are provided with holes that can serve as tie down points for a cable or the like. The cable can then be attached to a sandbag or like grounded position. Therefore the disrupter can not fly off during a detonation operation which would have made it difficult or impossible to later locate it for reuse.

Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide means to secure a disrupter unit to a sand bag or other stationary heavy means prior to firing the disrupter unit.

Another object of the present invention is to use the disrupter unit to shear wire such as barbed wire by attaching a wire cutter element to the disrupter unit through a robust cable.

A still further object of the present invention is to use the disrupter unit as a remote pull device or further to unearth a buried item via mechanical advantage wherein a military shovel or another long rod is attached by a robust cable to the disrupter unit.

These and other objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent in view of the within detailed descriptions of the invention the claims and in light of the following drawings wherein reference numerals may be reused where appropriate to indicate a correspondence between the referenced items. It should be understood that the sizes and shapes of the different components in the figures may not be in exact proportion and are shown here just for visual clarity and for purposes of explanation.
