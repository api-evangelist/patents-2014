This application is a division of U.S. application Ser. No. 13 055 615 filed Jan. 24 2011 the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference. U.S. application Ser. No. 13 055 615 is a national stage of PCT JP09 063 921 filed Aug. 6 2009 which is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from prior Japanese Application No. 2008 205424 filed Aug. 8 2008.

Heretofore a variety of optical fiber cables have been manufactured and used. For example in each of the optical fiber cables a so called optical fiber core wire having a coating composed of ultraviolet curing resin thermosetting resin or the like on an outer circumference of a glass optical fiber is prepared and this optical fiber core wire a pair of tension members and further a support wire are collectively coated while being positioned at a predetermined position whereby a sheath is formed.

Incidentally as a packing configuration of these optical fiber cables there is one in which the cable is housed in a housing container in a state of being wound in a figure of eight shape for example refer to Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Publication No. 2001 63784 . In this technique while winding the cable around a barrel like mandrel so as to draw the figure of eight shape a rotation speed of the mandrel and a pitch for winding the cable around the same are controlled whereby a bundle is formed while forming a hole in one radial spot of the bundle.

A winding terminal end of the cable is fixed to a box like housing container such as a corrugated cardboard box that houses this bundle. In the box like housing container a hole is provided at a position corresponding to the above described hole. A cylindrical guide member is inserted into the holes of the box like housing container and the bundle and a winding start end of the cable is inserted through the guide member. The cable is pulled out through the guide member to the outside of the box like housing container whereby the cable is paid out from an inner portion of the bundle in a state of sequentially collapsing.

It is known that when this technique is used a twist does not occur at the time of paying out the cable since the cable is wound in the figure of eight shape and moreover even if the cable is stopped being paid out a situation does not occur where the mandrel freely rotates like a reel by inertia to break the winding of the cable and the cable can be paid out favorably. Therefore this technique is generally used for a cable having some rigidity such as a LAN cable an optical drop cable and an optical indoor cable.

Incidentally in recent years an indoor cable has been developed and examined in which a diameter and friction of an outer sheath are decreased as a result of making much of ease in insertion and feeding thereof through a conduit and handling thereof. When the indoor cable in which the friction of the outer sheath is decreased or bending rigidity is decreased by reducing the diameter is wound into a bundle shape by the above mentioned technique then the cable on the outside of the bundle becomes prone to be broken. Therefore in order to house the bundle in the box like housing container so that the bundle cannot be broken an operation by two persons is required and such an operation is troublesome.

Moreover since the cable only has low rigidity when the cable is paid out from the box like housing container and a length of the cable remaining therein is reduced a circular shape of the whole bundle cannot be held and the whole bundle collapses into an ellipsoidal shape. Furthermore since adjacent portions of the bundled cable are prone to slip on each other there has been a problem that not only a portion thereof which is about to be paid out at the present time but also a portion thereof up to a few rounds ahead are broken in the inside of the bundle a phenomenon occurs that the cable is paid out while entangling such a broken portion and a bend and a knot are generated in the cable.

It is an object of the present invention to provide a packing configuration of a cable which makes it difficult to break the cylindrical shape of the cable bundle and makes it difficult to generate the bend and the knot in the cable.

In order to solve the foregoing problems provided is a packing configuration of a cable reflecting one aspect of the present invention including a cylindrical cable bundle in which a cable is wound in a figure of eight shape a restraining member which is arranged at an outer circumferential portion of the cable bundle to restrain the cable bundle and a housing container to house the cable bundle and the restraining member.

Further provided is the packing configuration of the cable wherein the restraining member is a wrapping film.

Further provided is the packing configuration of the cable wherein the restraining member restrains the cable by an elongation rate within a range of 10 to 200 .

Further provided is the packing configuration of the cable wherein a guide member which radially penetrates the cable bundle is provided in the cable bundle and the restraining member is provided while avoiding the guide member.

Further provided is the packing configuration of the cable wherein a closing member which closes an opening on both ends of the cable bundle is provided.

Further provided is the packing configuration of the cable wherein the closing member is a wrapping film.

According to another aspect of the present invention provided is a method for packing a cable having a static friction coefficient of 0.15 or more and 0.50 or less a dynamic friction coefficient of 0.10 or more and 0.40 or less and a bending rigidity of 60 gf or more and 350 gf or less. The method includes the steps of 1 winding the cable into a figure of eight shape to form a cylindrical cable bundle 2 winding a wrapping film as a restraining member which restrains the cable bundle around an outer circumferential portion of the cable bundle 3 winding a wrapping film as a closing member which closes openings on both ends of the cable bundle and 4 housing the cable bundle being wound with the restraining member and the closing member in a housing container.

In accordance with the present invention there can be provided the packing configuration of a cable which makes it difficult to break the cylindrical shape of the cable bundle and makes it difficult to generate the bend and the knot in the cable.

On longitudinal both sides on a cross section of the indoor cable the tension members are individually arranged apart from the optical fiber core wire . The tension members absorb tension acting on a body portion . As the tension members for example steel wires such as zinc plated steel wires fiber reinforced plastics FRP and the like can be used.

The sheath coats the optical fiber core wire and the tension members and as the sheath for example thermoplastic resin such as non halogen flame retardant polyolefin can be used. Notches are formed on center portions of the sheath and the sheath is ruptured from the notches whereby it is possible to easily take out the optical fiber core wire .

The present invention can be optimally applied to an indoor cable in which a range of bending rigidity is 60 gf or more in conformity with IEC60794 1 2 E17 measured under condition of D 40 mm . This is because when the bending rigidity is smaller than 60 gf it becomes difficult to insert the indoor cable into an already installed conduit in the case of using a construction method of inserting the cable through a conduit by pushing the cable thereinto. Meanwhile when the bending rigidity is larger than 350 gf management of the cable is deteriorated by a rebound thereof and accordingly it is preferable that the bending rigidity be 350 gf or less.

Moreover the present invention can be optimally applied to an indoor cable in which a static friction coefficient of adjacent portions is 0.50 or less and a dynamic friction coefficient thereof is 0.40 or less. This is because when the static friction coefficient is larger than 0.50 and the dynamic friction coefficient is larger than 0.40 it becomes difficult to insert the indoor cable into the already installed conduit in the case of using the construction method of inserting the cable through a conduit by pushing the cable thereinto. Moreover when the static friction coefficient is smaller than 0.15 and the dynamic friction coefficient is smaller than 0.10 it becomes not only difficult to handle the cable since a winding breakage is likely to occur but also a problem of a productivity deterioration occurs.

In the case of using the wrapping film as the restraining member it is preferable that an elongation rate of the wrapping film be within the range of 10 to 200 . This is because restraining force of the restraining member is weak when the elongation rate is smaller than 10 . Meanwhile this is because it is difficult to wind the restraining member when the elongation rate is larger than 200 .

In the case where friction or diameter of an outer sheath of the indoor cable is decreased the cable bundle is particularly prone to be broken. However the restraining member is wound around the outer circumferential portion of the cable bundle whereby a cylindrical shape of the cable bundle becomes less likely to be broken and the cable bundle can be easily detached from the mandrel.

The box like housing container has a rectangular parallelepiped shape. In the box like housing container the cable bundle around which the restraining member is wound is housed. As the box like housing container for example a box made of a corrugated cardboard can be used.

The restraining member is wound around the outer circumferential portion of the cable bundle whereby the cylindrical shape of the cable bundle is less likely to be broken. Accordingly the cable bundle can be easily housed in the box like housing container even by one person.

A hole though which the guide member is to be inserted is provided in the box like housing container . An inner end portion of the indoor cable is inserted through the guide member and is pulled out to the outside of the box like housing container . The indoor cable is pulled out from the guide member whereby the indoor cable is paid out in a state of sequentially collapsing from an inner portion of the cable bundle .

As the closing member for example a wrapping film made of polyethylene or the like can be used. The closing member is wound while avoiding the guide member .

The openings on both ends of the cable bundle are closed by the closing member whereby the indoor cable broken from the inner portion can be prevented from jumping out from the openings on both ends of the cable bundle .

Also in this embodiment the restraining member is wound around the outer circumferential portion of the cable bundle whereby the cylindrical shape of the cable bundle becomes less likely to be broken and the cable bundle can be easily detached from the mandrel. Moreover the cable bundle can be easily housed in the box like housing container even by one person.

Also in this embodiment the outer circumferential portion of the cable bundle is restrained by the restraining members and the box like housing container whereby the cylindrical shape of the cable bundle becomes less likely to be broken and the cable bundle can be easily detached from the mandrel.

A wrapping film was wound around an outer circumferential portion of a cable bundle formed by winding an indoor cable with a length of 1000 m into a figure of eight shape and the cable bundle was housed in a box like housing container made of a corrugated cardboard. Then a pay out test to be described below was performed by using a packing configuration thus obtained.

A dynamic friction coefficient of adjacent portions of the cable was 0.25 and a static friction coefficient thereof was 0.20.

Moreover as the cable one was used in which bending rigidity in conformity with IEC60794 1 2 E17C measured under condition of D 40 mm is 92 gf.

Here the dynamic friction coefficient and static friction coefficient of the adjacent portions of the cable were measured in the following manner. is a schematic view showing a method for measuring the friction coefficients of the adjacent portions of the cable.

Specifically on a base two indoor cables with a length of 150 mm which are shown in were arrayed adjacent and parallel to each other and the indoor cable with a length of 300 mm which is a sample to be subjected to the measurement of the friction coefficients was stacked thereon like a straw bag. On this optical fiber cable as the sample measurement sample optical fiber cables and with a length of 150 mm which are as mentioned above were further stacked like straw bags as shown in .

Thereafter a pressing plate that slides up and down while being guided by a plurality of slide guides vertically erected on the base was mounted on the stacked cables so as to be parallel to the base . The same cables were used as the indoor cables and .

Next a weight was mounted on the pressing plate and a constant load of 19.6 N was applied to the pressing plate in an arrow direction. In this state the indoor cable as the sample was pulled out frontward at a speed of 100 mm min by using a load cell. As static friction force F peak friction force when the indoor cable started to move was employed and a static friction coefficient F 19.6 N was obtained. Meanwhile as dynamic friction force F an average value was employed obtained from the values at positions ranging from 30 mm to 80 mm from a point where the friction force exhibited the lowest value after passing through the peak friction force when the indoor cable started to move. By using this dynamic friction force F a friction coefficient F 19.6 N was obtained. The number n of samples was set as n 3.

The restraining member was not used. Except for this testing conditions were set similar to those of Example 10.

The closing member was wound around the cable bundle so as to close 60 of an opening area of the openings on both ends thereof. As the closing member a polyethylene made wrapping film with a width of 100 mm and a thickness of 0.03 mm was used and the wrapping film winding strength was set at 100 to 200 g. Except for these testing conditions were set similar to those of Example 1. At this time an elongation rate of the wrapping film used as the closing member was approximately 10 .

Three bends occurred in Example 1. One bend occurred in each of Examples 4 7 and 10. No bends occurred in Examples 2 3 5 6 8 9 and 11 to 18.

Moreover the bends were less likely to occur in the examples where the restraining member was wound two or three times than in the examples where the restraining member was wound only once. This is because the restraining force for the cable bundle is strengthened by winding the restraining member a plurality of times.

Moreover no bends occurred in Example 19 where the closing member was provided in addition to the restraining member.

Furthermore no bends occurred in Examples 20 to 23 either each of which uses as the restraining member the cylindrical restraining member made of the corrugated cardboard which is shown in or the triangular prism restraining member made of the corrugated cardboard which is shown in .

As described above the cable bundle is restrained by the restraining member whereby an occurrence frequency of the bends can be reduced.

Although various exemplary embodiments have been shown and described the invention is not limited to the embodiments shown. Therefore the scope of the invention is intended to be limited solely by the scope of the clams that follow.
