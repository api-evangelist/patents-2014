title: Grenade fuze and detonator with flying disc
abstract: A more IM compliant energetics train for a grenade fuze or a detonator includes an explosive charge containing PBXN-5 and a first charge containing PBX-9407 disposed adjacent to the PBXN-5 explosive charge. A flying disc is disposed adjacent to the first charge of PBX-9407. A barrel has one end disposed adjacent to the flying disc and an opposite end disposed adjacent to a second charge containing PBX-9407. Detonation of the first charge containing PBX-9407 causes the flying disc to accelerate through the barrel, impact the second charge containing PBX-9407 and detonate the second charge containing PBX-9407.

The present application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61 822 533 filed on May 13 2013 which is incorporated by reference herein.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The invention relates in general to fuzes and detonators for munitions and in particular to the Insensitive Munitions IM compliance requirements for fuzes and detonators.

A primary explosive is an explosive that is extremely sensitive to stimuli such as impact friction heat static electricity or electromagnetic radiation. A relatively small amount of energy is required for initiation of a primary explosive. Primary explosives are often used in fuzes and detonators to trigger larger charges of less sensitive secondary explosives.

A major concern in the field of fuzing and detonators is the ability to meet the Insensitive Munitions IM compliance requirements. Specifically stimuli such as bullets fragments and shape charge impacts are difficult IM challenges for detonators and fuzes. In particular the primary energetics or explosives in these items are sensitive to the IM stimuli and may initiate the complete energetic train of a munition in a high order detonation.

Detonators and fuzes are similar in design and may use the same or similar types of energetics to attain the high order reaction. Detonators and or fuzes may use primary and secondary energetics to achieve the needed detonation reaction speeds velocities. Examples of primary energetics are materials such as lead azide lead styphnate RDX and others. Examples of secondary energetics are materials such as PBX 9407 PBXN 5 PBXN 107 PBXN 109 and others. The primary energetics are more sensitive to impact stimuli than the secondary energetics.

The primer initiates the delay mix . The delay mix provides a time delay for example a few seconds before the delay mix initiates the lead styphnate . The lead styphnate initiates the lead azide . The lead azide initiates the RDX . The RDX initiates the main charge not shown in the grenade for example Composition B.

In the grenade fuze and the detonator the primary energetics are lead styphnate lead azide and RDX . In the fuze the percussion primer is also a primary energetic. These primary energetics are sensitive to stimuli such as bullet fragment and shape charge impact and are problematic for IM compliance.

A need exists for fuzes and detonators that are less sensitive to impacts than known fuzes and detonators.

One aspect of the invention is an apparatus having an energetics train. The energetics train includes an explosive charge containing PBXN 5 and a first charge containing PBX 9407 disposed adjacent to the PBXN 5 explosive charge. A flying disc is disposed adjacent to the first charge of PBX 9407. One end of a barrel is disposed adjacent to the flying disc. A second charge containing PBX 9407 is disposed adjacent to an opposite end of the barrel. The detonation of the first charge containing PBX 9407 causes the flying disc to accelerate through the barrel impact the second charge containing PBX 9407 and detonate the second charge containing PBX 9407.

In one embodiment the apparatus is a grenade fuze assembly. The grenade fuze assembly includes a grenade fuze body and a striker lever rotatably attached to the grenade fuze body. A spring loaded rotor assembly is rotatably fixed to the grenade fuze body. The energetics train is disposed in the grenade fuze body. A primer is disposed in the grenade fuze assembly.

In another embodiment the apparatus is a detonator. The detonator includes a generally longitudinal detonator housing with the energetics train disposed therein. One of a shock tube and a detonation cord may be disposed at one end of the detonator housing in explosive communication with the explosive charge containing PBXN 5.

Another aspect of the invention is a method of initiating energetic material. The method includes providing the novel energetics train and detonating the explosive charge containing PBXN 5. The explosive charge containing PBXN 5 is used to detonate the first charge containing PBX 9407. Detonation of the first charge containing PBX 9407 accelerates the flying disc through the barrel. The flying disc detonates the second charge containing PBX 9407.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The energetics train includes a charge containing PBXN 5 followed by a first PBX 9407 charge . A flying disc is disposed adjacent to the first charge of PBX 9407. Flying disc may be made of for example aluminum. One end of a barrel is disposed adjacent to the flying disc and another end of the barrel is disposed adjacent to a second PBX 9407 charge . Detonation of the first PBX 9407 charge causes the flying disc to accelerate through the barrel . Flying disc impacts the second PBX 9407 charge thereby detonating the second PBX 9407 charge . The second PBX 9407 charge initiates the main charge not shown in the grenade for example Composition B.

Because energetics train includes only secondary explosives the only primary explosive in fuze assembly is the primer . Thus compared to fuze assembly fuze assembly has much less surface area that is sensitive to impact from bullets fragments and shaped charges.

In primer containing primary explosive is disposed in line with energetics train . Alternatively primer may be out of line with energetics train . For example as shown in a fuze assembly has a primer and firing pin disposed in a rotor assembly . The placement of the primer in rotor assembly is described in more detail in commonly owned U.S. non provisional patent application Ser. No. 14 014 723 filed on Aug. 20 2013 and entitled Flying Primer for Hand Grenade Fuze. The U.S. non provisional patent application Ser. No. 14 014 723 is expressly incorporated by reference herein. When the primer is disposed in the rotor assembly and out of line with the energetics train as in the detonation of the primary explosive in the primer will not cause the energetics train to detonate. Thus with primer disposed in rotor assembly the entire fuze assembly meets IM compliance standards.

The PBXN 5 charge may be detonated by a component disposed at end of housing . Component may be for example a shock tube or detonation cord. Because energetics train includes only secondary explosives detonator has much less surface area that is sensitive to impact from bullets fragments and shaped charges compared to prior art detonator .

While the invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
