The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the U.S. Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The disclosed embodiments relate in general to an aerial delivery system and more particularly to providing aerial delivery while mitigating a risk of injury.

Natural disasters often result in a lack of food or clean water for the first 48 72 hours after the disaster occurs as a result of infrastructure damage for example power plants water treatment plants roads ports and runways. Airdrops of humanitarian aid supplies such as medical supplies food and clothing provide needed relief in these situations. In a related area forestry fire fighters are generally resupplied with food and water by aerial delivery of multiple 50 pound bundles. Various military ground operations may require resupply of ammunition clothing and rations through aerial delivery and both military and commercial organizations may seek to provide information to a population through aerial delivery.

Present airdrop capabilities in particular humanitarian food and water drops suffer from drawbacks including a lack of ability to deliver water and a large injury risk posed by delivery mechanisms including containers skid boards and large food items for example Meals Ready to Eat MREs or Humanitarian Daily Rations HDRs . The U.S. and British armies and private industry have used impact attenuators in several forms for aerial delivery. For example external struts comprised of inner and outer cylinders that force hydraulic fluid through an orifice to dampen impact have been used on spacecraft capsules as well as on aircraft main landing gear. These systems provide great control over the force time curve however they are expensive complicated and beyond the expertise of the average rigger. Airbags have also been used in several military applications. The British have used a specially designed platform the Medium Stress Platform MSP with recesses to house deflated airbags for cargo airdrop. Upon exit from the aircraft the airbags inflate and attenuate the load during impact. This system utilizes a fixed venting area resulting in a peaked force time curve where a rectangular profile is desired. The rectangular force time curve can be obtained with airbags using variable venting areas adding to the cost and complexity of the system. As much of the stroke of the airbag is used to build the pressure the system is often excessively large leading to possible hazards on the ground including re inflation of the airbag and payload roll over. In addition the aircraft platform interface has to be modified to accept these platforms.

Present delivery systems also suffer from clumping where items have a tendency to clump together and fail to disperse over the drop zone. Furthermore items that clump together generally fall faster and experience a much harder impact reducing their survivability and usefulness after landing and creating a danger for those on the ground in the drop zone.

It would be advantageous to utilize an airdrop system that overcomes these and other problems and safely disperses various items directly over a population.

The disclosed embodiments are directed to an aerial delivery system including at least one container mounted on a platform an impact attenuator initially interposed between the container and the platform an activation tether arranged to cause contents of the container to disperse and rigging material attached to the impact attenuator the platform and the activation tether and configured to rotate the platform to face upward and the impact attenuator to face downward during aerial delivery.

The disclosed embodiments are also directed an aerial delivery system having a plurality of containers mounted on a platform an impact attenuator initially interposed between the containers and the platform a rigging arrangement passing through the impact attenuator and the platform the rigging arrangement including an activation tether arranged to cause contents of the containers to disperse and a suspension point attached to an end of the activation tether the rigging arrangement configured to rotate the platform to face upward and the impact attenuator to face downward during aerial delivery.

These and other aspects and advantages of the exemplary embodiments will become apparent from the following detailed description considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. It is to be understood however that the drawings are designed solely for purposes of illustration and not as a definition of the limits of the invention for which reference should be made to the appended claims. Additional aspects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description that follows and in part will be obvious from the description or may be learned by practice of the invention. Moreover the aspects and advantages of the invention may be realized and obtained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.

Referring to one embodiment of an aerial delivery system incorporating aspects of the disclosed embodiments is illustrated. The aspects of the disclosed embodiments are generally directed to an aerial delivery system that allows for dispersion of items directly above an active population while mitigating the risk of injury. The disclosed embodiments at least provide for releasing items in tiers for improved dispersion and to avoid clumping reconfiguration of impact attenuator material after deployment and retention of all delivery components to avoid injury to the active population.

As shown in each piece of rigging material may be laced so that ends of the first piece of rigging material and ends of the second piece of rigging material extend from the impact attenuator and exit through a side of the platform facing away from the impact attenuator . As shown in ends and are secured together to form a rigging suspension point .

As shown in the platform and impact attenuator are inverted and the rigging material is secured in place allowing the platform to freely interface with various aircraft cargo handling arrangements for example powered cargo handling equipment forklifts conveyors rails and rollers in the aircraft cargo bay and any other device for transporting the aerial delivery system . The rigging material and suspension point may then be draped over the impact attenuator and the suspension point may be attached to the activation tether .

As shown in enclosure net is placed over the impact attenuator with at least the activation tether extending through and operating to retain the enclosure net . In some embodiments the suspension point may also extend through the enclosure net . Additional rigging shown in may secure the enclosure net to the impact attenuator or the platform . The containers are stacked on the impact attenuator over the enclosure net in alternating tiers with each tier oriented lengthwise perpendicular to the next. The containers may be filled before assembling the aerial delivery system or may be filled as each tier is assembled. In at least one embodiment lanyards are attached to adjacent containers in each tier and then to one of the tiered attachment points of the activation tether as shown in . While the lanyards are shown attached to the bottom of the containers it should be understood that the lanyards may be attached to any portion of the containers so long as the contents of the containers are effectively emptied from the containers during deployment.

In a HALO deployment the parachute inflates upon exit from an aircraft and descends with the enclosure net and containers as shown in . Upon reaching a prescribed altitude or exceeding a prescribed time duration the release mechanism releases the enclosure net and containers from the parachute as shown in . As the separation distance increases the still attached activation tether extends and the lanyards attached to each tier of containers cause the containers to change orientation for example to invert and their contents are dispersed tier by tier as shown in . Advantageously the tiered release reduces clumping of the contents and provides for improved dispersion over the drop area. All the components of the delivery system including the parachute containers enclosure net platform and impact attenuator remain attached to activation tether and lanyards as shown in . As the activation tether extends the suspension point attachment of the activation tether pulls on the rigging suspension point causing the platform and impact attenuator to rotate and change orientation with the platform facing up and the impact attenuator facing downward before touching down. The down facing impact attenuator operates to reduce or eliminate injury to ground personnel from the delivery system during touch down.

In a direct deployment the enclosure net and containers separate from the parachute upon exiting the aircraft. Similar to the embodiment above as the separation distance increases the still attached activation tether extends and the lanyards attached to each tier of containers cause the containers to change orientation and their contents are dispersed tier by tier. In direct deployment the containers also remain attached to the lanyards and activation tether . Similar to the embodiment above as the activation tether extends the suspension point attachment of the activation tether pulls on the rigging suspension point causing the platform and impact attenuator to rotate and change orientation with the platform facing up and the impact attenuator facing downward before touching down.

The disclosed aerial delivery system provides improved content dispersion by releasing the content material in tiers operates to reconfigure a support platform during flight so that an impact attenuator faces downward to protect ground personnel from a support platform or other components of the aerial delivery system and retains all delivery system components together to minimize injury risk and to facilitate recovery of delivery system components if desired.

Thus while there have been shown described and pointed out fundamental novel features of the invention as applied to the exemplary embodiments thereof it will be understood that various omissions and substitutions and changes in the form and details of devices and methods illustrated and in their operation may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. Moreover it is expressly intended that all combinations of those elements and or method steps which perform substantially the same function in substantially the same way to achieve the same results are within the scope of the invention. Moreover it should be recognized that structures and or elements and or method steps shown and or described in connection with any disclosed form or embodiment of the invention may be incorporated in any other disclosed or described or suggested form or embodiment as a general matter of design choice. It is the intention therefore to be limited only as indicated by the scope of the claims appended hereto.
