Operator services typically use circuit switched based connectivity to provide a voice session from a customer to a customer care agent. Typically operators access back office systems to resolve customer care problems through a web portal. The web browser platform has evolved to tightly couple signaling and media into the browser for example a web real time communication WebRTC capable browser to support audio and video media sessions from a browser compatible platform laptops tablets workstations smartphones etc.

In an embodiment a customer care system is disclosed. The system comprises a web real time communication WebRTC capable browser as an interface portal for a customer care operator configured to identify registered operators initiate a customer care session between a caller and the operator display interactive hypertext markup language HTML web forms to the operator and transmit inputs from the operator to an application server. The web real time communication capable browser is further configured to define the interface portal with instructions contained in session initiation protocol SIP INFO media server control markup language MSCML payloads wherein a SIP INFO MSCML payload is an MSCML payload encapsulated in a SIP INFO message and script the operator s communication with the caller. The system further comprises a transformation engine configured to use SIP hypertext transfer protocol HTTP signaling transcoding to invite the operator to the customer care session map a SIP INFO MSCML payload to an interactive HTML web form and transmit to the operator the HTML web forms transformed from SIP INFO MSCML payloads sent by the application server. The transformation engine is further configured to transmit to the application server SIP INFO MSCML payloads transformed from the HTML web forms sent by the operator and use instructions from the SIP INFO MSCML payloads to script the operator s communication with the caller.

In an embodiment a method of managing a customer care system is disclosed. The method comprises using session initiation protocol SIP hypertext transfer protocol HTTP signaling transcoding to invite a customer care operator to a customer care session with a caller identifying registered customer care operators through a web real time communication WebRTC browser wherein the browser is an interface portal for the customer care operator displaying the caller s disposition by the browser displaying prior knowledge at a telephony application server TAS about the current customer care session and displaying interactive hypertext markup language HTML web forms to the operator. The method further comprises transcoding SIP INFO media server control markup language MSCML payloads and HTML web forms by a transformation engine transmitting to the operator the HTML web forms transformed from SIP INFO MSCML payloads sent by an application server transmitting to the application server the SIP INFO MSCML payloads transformed from the HTML web forms sent by the operator and defining the interface portal with instructions contained in the SIP INFO MSCML payloads. The method further comprises using instructions from the SIP INFO MSCML payloads to script the operator s communication with the caller validating the caller s identity at the application server and transferring the caller to a destination number when the caller s identity is validated.

In an embodiment a method of managing a customer care system is disclosed. The method comprises using session initiation protocol SIP hypertext transfer protocol HTTP signaling transcoding to invite a customer care operator to a customer care session with a caller displaying interactive hypertext markup language HTML web forms to the operator and mapping a SIP INFO media server control markup language MSCML payload to an interactive HTML web form by a transformation engine. The method further comprises transmitting to the operator the HTML web forms transformed from SIP INFO MSCML payloads sent by an application server transmitting to the application server the SIP INFO MSCML payloads transformed from the HTML web forms sent by the operator validating the caller s identity at the application server and transferring the caller to a destination number when the caller s identity is validated.

These and other features will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and claims.

It should be understood at the outset that although illustrative implementations of one or more embodiments are illustrated below the disclosed systems and methods may be implemented using any number of techniques whether currently known or not yet in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations drawings and techniques illustrated below but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.

In some circumstances when more call originations are attempted in an area than can be supported at one time for example on a single cell tower privileged users may be granted special access and their call originations be handled in advance of call originations of unprivileged users. For example during an emergency a cell tower may receive more call origination attempts than it can handle at the same time. In this situation a privileged or priority user such as an emergency first responder may be able to authenticate his or her privileged status by providing a special personal identification number and obtain an immediate wireless connection.

In emergency situations so many people may try to make phone calls concurrently that the number of call requests may exceed the capacity of a base transceiver station from a wireless communication services provider. It may be desirable to queue up phone calls from first responders with priority in these circumstances. Said in other words the phone call from a first responder may be provided a wireless communication link even if other callers ahead of the first responder continue to wait and or even if an ongoing normal priority call is dropped. When a first responder makes a phone call for example with a mobile communication device in an emergency a communication services provider may desire to verify the identity of the caller before transferring the caller with priority to a destination number. Typically the caller may be asked by an interactive voice recognition IVR system to enter a personal identification number PIN or a password. However the caller may not provide a correct personal identification number for a variety of reasons. For example the caller may be under stress and may not remember the correct personal identification number right away. In existing systems after a predefined number of personal identification number failures the phone call may not be treated with priority by the communication services provider.

Under these circumstances the caller may wish to engage a live operator to assist in completing the call. The operator may use a customer care system that may couple to or may be a part of an IP multimedia subsystem IMS that supports different communication modes for example audio and video. The operator may work with the customer care system through a certain type of browser. The mobile device may communicate with an application server of the IP multimedia subsystem via the session initiation protocol SIP . The application server may communicate with other nodes in the IP multimedia subsystem for example a media resource function via session initiation protocol also. On the other hand the operator s browser may not recognize session initiation protocol but may recognize hypertext markup language HTML . Thus a transformation engine or gateway may also be introduced in the customer care system to transcode between nodes that operate with different protocols. The transformation engine may transcode session initiation protocol codes and hypertext markup language codes.

The present disclosure teaches a system and method for using media server control markup language MSCML messages to dynamically interact with a web real time communication WebRTC customer care operator. A WebRTC capable browser may couple signaling and media into the browser. For example the WebRTC browser may support audio and video media sessions from a browser compatible platform for example a laptop computer a tablet computer a workstation or a smart phone. The WebRTC browser allows the audio and video session to be controlled through the browser. The WebRTC browser allows customer care operators to register for receiving making calls to from a browser and provide the web portal framework to back end systems desired to support the customer.

For example the transformation engine may transcode codes from session initiation protocol SIP hypertext markup language HTML and or JavaScript. For example each MSCML payload via a SIP INFO request may be mapped into a unique interactive HTML web form. Thus an MSCML payload on a SIP INFO request from an application server in the customer care system may be transformed to an HTML web form and transmitted through hypertext transfer protocol HTTP to the WebRTC capable browser. An HTML web form may be an HTML 5 webpage with JavaScript application programming interfaces APIs . Similarly information from an HTML web form from the WebRTC capable browser may be transformed by the transformation engine into an MSCML payload on a SIP INFO request and transmitted to the application server.

The application server may send commands requests to the operator via the transformation engine and the browser. The operator may be instructed by the application server to request the caller for answer s to personal identification related question s . For example a separate voice link may be established between the operator and the caller. During the voice session the operator may ask the caller the address of his her organization supervisor s name or another personal identification related question. The operator may also collect a destination number from the caller. The operator may input the collected answer s to the personal identification related question s and the destination number into the interactive HTML web form. The browser may transmit content extracted from the HTML web form to the application server for validation. The transformation engine may transcode the HTML web form to a SIP INFO MSCML payload for the browser and transmit the transformed SIP INFO MSCML payload to the application server. The application server may transmit back the validation results to the browser. If the caller is verified to be a first responder the application server may transmit instructions on an MSCML message via a SIP INFO request to the operator and instruct the operator to inform the caller of being transferred to the destination number. The application server may then transfer the caller to the destination number.

Thus when the first responder accidentally provides a false personal identification number when the first responder does not remember the personal identification number or when a supervisor of the first responder accidentally provides the first responder with a false personal identification number the disclosed system promotes resolving the problem by having a live operator verify the identity of the first responder and assist in completing the call with the disclosed system and method. The disclosed system provides this technical solution by in part effecting a bridge between two unlike and or incompatible communication systems.

Turning now to a communication system is described. In an embodiment the communication system comprises a first server a second server an operator and a plurality of mobile communication devices . The first server may comprise a transformation engine an application server function and a media resource function MRF . The second server may comprise a browser . The mobile device may be configured to use a universal mobile telecommunications system terrestrial radio access network that comprises an enhanced Node B eNB to establish a wireless communication link with a packet core network . In another embodiment another radio access network and or communication network may be used for example a radio access network have base transceiver stations BTSs The first server and the second server may also have access to the network . In an embodiment the first server and the second server may locate in the same wired or wireless local area network LAN . The network may comprise any combination of private and public networks. In an embodiment the transformation engine may be hosted and executed on the second server .

The first server and the second server may access the network through wired or wireless access networks. The wired access network may be abstracted in different ways and may comprise cable modems and Ethernet routers switches or hubs. The wireless access network may also be abstracted in different ways and may comprise wireless access points cable modems Ethernet or wireless routers switches or hubs servers and data storages such as home location registers HLRs or servers that implement the functionality of home location registers visitor location registers VLRs or servers that implement the functionality of visitor location registers mobile management entities a universal mobile telecommunications system terrestrial radio access network packet core network and other network nodes that are specifically associated with providing wireless access and connectivity to the server computers.

It is understood that the system may comprise any number of mobile devices any number of operators and any number of enhanced Node Bs . The collectivity of enhanced Node Bs may be said to comprise a universal mobile telecommunications system terrestrial radio access network in that these enhanced Node Bs may provide a radio communication link to the mobile devices to provide access to the network . The universal mobile telecommunications system terrestrial radio access network may be abstracted in different ways and may comprise in addition to the enhanced Node Bs components from the wireless access network.

The radio transceiver of the mobile communication device may communicate with the base transceiver station using any of a variety of wireless communication protocols including a code division multiple access CDMA wireless communication protocol a global system for mobile communication GSM wireless communication protocol a long term evolution LTE wireless communication protocol a world wide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX wireless communication protocol or another wireless communication protocol. The mobile device may be any of a mobile phone a personal digital assistant PDA a media player a laptop computer a tablet computer a notebook computer or another network communications capable device. In an embodiment the mobile communication device may have other components not shown such as a near field communication NFC radio transceiver a wireless local area network WLAN radio transceiver or other components.

The transformation engine the application server and the media resource function may be implemented using one or more server computers. The transformation engine the application server and the media resource function may locate in one computer for example a server computer in three different computers for example a first server computer for the transformation engine a second server computer for the application server and a third server computer for the media resource function in multiple different computers for example a first group of multiple server computers for the transformation engine a second group of multiple server computers for the application server and a third group of multiple computers for the media resource function or in some other combination of computers. In an embodiment when the transformation engine the application server and the media resource function do not locate in one computer the transformation engine the application server and the media resource function may share the same wired or wireless local area network. The first server and the second server may be said to be components of a customer care system. The customer care system may couple to or may be a part of an IP multimedia subsystem IMS .

The media resource function may also be referred to as a media server. Each media resource function comprises a media resource function controller MRFC and a media resource function processor MRFP . In an embodiment the media resource function may provide media related functionality for example media manipulation e.g. voice stream mixing and playing tones and announcements. For example when a caller is validated as a first responder and the caller is about to be directed to the destination number the media resource function may play a final announcement to the caller.

In an embodiment the application server may be an application instead of a piece of hardware. The application server may host and or execute the IP multimedia subsystem service logic. For example the application server may provide the service logic for invoking the media resource function to support call progress tones and announcements. The application server may initiate a communication session and or terminate a communication session. The application server may direct a call session to an operator when identity validation of the caller fails. The application server may manage a call session progress by sending commands requests to relevant nodes in the customer care system. Additionally the application server may validate identity information of a caller to determine whether the call may be directed to a destination with priority.

For example when a caller makes a phone call through a communication network of a communication services provider the caller initiates a request to start a communication session. The application server may generate the request to start the communication session after the request from the caller is received at the application server . The application server may send the generated request to a media resource function and initiate a call to a destination number that was provided by the phone.

As another example when an emergency or a disaster occurs in an area phone lines may be jammed with a number of people making phone calls which exceeds the capacity of the communication network around the area. For example if an aircraft crashes in an urban area surrounding people may make phone calls about the incident and the carrier wireless network access around the area may be jammed. A first responder may desire to make a phone call with wireless network attachment priority after the disaster. A first responder may be a fire personnel police personnel an emergency medical personnel or another type of emergency personnel. When the identity of the first responder is validated for example with a personal identification number PIN or a password the phone call from the first responder may be placed with priority through the core edge and core of the wireless network. Said in other words the phone call may be provided a wireless communication link by the enhanced Node B even if other callers ahead of the first responder continue to wait and or even if an ongoing normal priority call is dropped. However when the first responder provides a wrong personal identification number or when the first responder could not provide a personal identification number the phone call may typically not be transferred to a destination number.

In an embodiment the first responder may be forwarded to an operator by the application server after a predefined number of personal identification number failures for example three personal identification number failures. Alternatively the first responder may choose to speak to the operator in the beginning and may be transferred by the application server to the operator even before the first responder is asked for a personal identification number. For example the application server may initiate a call session with a customer care operator and the caller. For example the application server may generate a first request to initiate a communication session with and transmit the first request to a mobile device of the caller the first responder if the caller is making a phone call with the mobile device . The application server may generate a second request to initiate the communication session with and transmit the second request to a browser . The transformation engine may obtain and or transform the request to a format that is understandable by the browser and send the transformed request to the browser . The browser may display the request to the operator to start a communication session with the caller.

The application server may validate the caller identification before directing the call to a destination number. For example the application server may send a request to browser through the transformation engine to collect identification related information and validate the collected identification information at the application server . For example the application server may send a media server control markup language payload MSCML encapsulated in a session initiation protocol SIP INFO request to the browser via the transformation engine with instructions for the operator to collect a personal identification number and or a destination number. Answer s to personal identification related question s may also be referred to as a personal identification number herein. When the transformation engine sends the collected personal identification number and or the destination number to the application server for the browser the application server may validate the caller identity. For example the application server may check the caller identity against records in a data store to determine whether the caller is a first responder or not. Additionally the application server may check the destination number against records in the data store to determine whether the destination number is an emergency related phone number.

When the validation is completed at the application server the application server may transmit the validation results to the browser via the transformation engine . The transformation engine may transform the validation results and transmit the transformed validation results to the browser . When the caller is determined to be a first responder and the destination number is emergency related the operator may send a request to direct the call session to the destination number. Alternatively when the caller is determined to be a first responder the operator may send a request to direct the call session to the destination number.

The application server may send a request to the media resource function indicating the caller is being invited to participate in a call session with the destination number this time. The media resource function may play corresponding tones and or announcements. For example the media resource function may play a final announcement to inform the caller of being directed to the destination number after a request to play a final announcement from the application server is received at the media resource function . The application server may then direct the caller to the destination number. For example the application server may send a request to the destination number to initiate a call session with the caller. Additionally alternatively when the identity of the caller is validated the application server may send a separate HTML page on a SIP INFO MSCML payload to instruct the operator to inform the caller of being transferred to the destination number. An MSCML payload encapsulated in a SIP INFO message may be referred to herein as a SIP INFO MSCML payload.

In an embodiment the browser may be a web real time communication capable browser that communicates via JavaScript application programming interfaces APIs and or hypertext markup language 5 HTML5 for example a Chrome browser of a stable version with web real time communication APIs a Firefox browser of a stable version with web real time communication APIs an Opera browser of a stable version with web real time communication APIs or another web real time communication capable browser. Web real time communication capable browsers may support voice calling video chat and or peer to peer file sharing without plugins. The browser may be an interface portal for the customer care operator . For example customer care operators may be registered through the browser . The browser may display relevant information in interactive hypertext markup language HTML web forms to the operator . Additionally the browser may transmit inputs from the operator to the application server via the transformation engine .

For example the browser may display visual ring to the operator in case of an incoming call. The browser may request identification validation information from the operator to determine whether the operator is authorized to handle a communication session for example an audio session from a first responder. The operator may input a personal identification number into the browser and the browser may validate the identity of the operator for example by communicating with the application server or a data store that keeps records for operator access rights information. When the identification of the operator is validated the browser may display and or activate interactive buttons to the operator .

The operator may control an audio or video session through the browser for example with the interactive buttons. For example the browser may comprise interactive buttons such as accept drop hold transfer conference or another button for the operator to choose from to control an audio or video session. In an embodiment an authorized operator may choose an accept button on the browser to join an incoming audio or video session. The browser may be defined with information contained in MSCML payloads in SIP INFO requests. For example the MSCML payloads from the application server may be transcoded by the transformation engine to HTML web forms and transmitted to the browser . The interactive HTML web forms may be defined and or updated with information in the MSCML payloads.

For example instructions from the SIP INFO MSCML payloads may be used to script the operator s communication with the caller. For example instructions may be transmitted by the application server on a MSCML payload transformed into an HTML web form by the transformation engine and displayed by the browser to instruct the operator to ask the caller to hold the call for a moment while the operator verifies the identification information of the caller with the application server . After the identity of the caller is verified a separate HTML web form may be transformed by the transformation engine from content extracted from on a MSCML payload sent by the application server and displayed by the browser to instruct the operator to inform the caller of being directed to a destination number.

Prior knowledge at a telephony application server TAS about the current customer care session may be displayed by the browser to the operator . A telephony application server may be an application that provides application server s with telephony services for example digit analysis routing call setup call waiting call forwarding conferencing or another type of call processing service. In an embodiment a telephony application server may store information of a customer care session and provide this information to the operator via the browser . For example if the caller is a first responder with three previous personal identification number failures the telephony application server may transmit this information in a MSCML payload in a SIP INFO request to the browser via the transformation engine . The transformation engine may transform the MSCML payload into an HTML web form and transmit the HTML web form to the browser . The browser may update the current HTML web form with updated information from the newly received HTML web form for example delete information or add information based on incremental content from the current HTML web form to the newly received HTML web form. Alternatively the browser may replace the current HTML web form with the newly received HTML web form. In an embodiment when the operator sees the information on the browser that the caller is a first responder with three previous personal identification number failures time that typically may be used to ask the caller why he she called may be saved.

As another example the browser may display the caller s disposition information. For example if the caller is a responder that chose to speak to an operator this disposition information may be transmitted from the telephony application server to the transformation engine on an MSCML payload encapsulated in a SIP INFO request. The transformation engine may transform the MSCML payload to an HTML web form and transmit the HTML web form to the browser . The browser may display this caller disposition information to the operator with the received HTML web form.

In an embodiment the transformation engine may be a component that transcodes for the application server and the browser . The transformation engine may also be referred to as a WebRTC engine herein. A single transformation engine may work with more than one operator . The browser and the transformation engine may be said to form a WebRTC system. The transformation engine may transmit the transformed codes from the application server to the browser . The transformation engine may also transmit the transformed codes from the browser to the application server . For example the transformation engine may transform SIP INFO MSCML payloads from the application server into HTML web forms and transmit the HTML web forms to the browser . The transformation engine may transform HTML web forms from the browser into SIP INFO MSCML payloads and transmit the MSCML payloads to the application server .

The transformation engine may communicate with the application server in a similar way that a media resource function may communicate with the application server in a typical existing IP multimedia subsystem. The transformation engine may communicate with the application server with SIP requests and responses. The transformation engine may communicate with the browser with HTML web forms via hypertext transfer protocol HTTP . For example the transformation engine may use session initiation protocol SIP hypertext transfer protocol HTTP signaling transcoding to invite a customer care operator to a customer care session with a caller. For example when an application server transmits a SIP INVITE request to invite an operator to a communication session the application server may first transmit the SIP INVITE request to a transformation engine . The transformation engine may transform the SIP INVITE request to a WebSocket request. The Websocket protocol may be a transport layer on top of transmission control protocol TCP . The WebSocket connection handshake is based on hypertext transfer protocol and the handshake procedure is designed to reuse the existing hypertext transfer protocol infrastructure.

SIP INFO MSCML payloads from the application server may comprise instructions for the operator to collect a personal identification number and a destination number from the caller. The transformation engine may transform the MSCML payload to an HTML web form and transmit the HTML web form to the browser . The browser may display the instructions to the operator . The instructions may comprise personal identification related question s for example supervisor name of the caller.

The operator may talk to the caller in a voice session and ask the caller at least one of the personal identification related questions. The operator may also ask the caller for a destination number. The operator may input the answer s to corresponding personal identification related question s and the destination number into a corresponding HTML web form on the browser . The browser may transmit the HTML web form with the answer s the corresponding question s and the destination number to the transformation engine . The transformation engine may transform the HTML web form to an MSCML payload and transmit the MSCML payload encapsulated in a SIP INFO request to the application server . The application server may validate the caller identification by determining whether the answer s to the personal identification related question s are correct for example by checking with a data store that keeps records for personal identification related questions and answers.

In an embodiment the application server may transmit the validation results to the transformation engine in an MSCML payload encapsulated in a SIP INFO request. The transformation engine may transform the MSCML payload to an HTML web form. In an embodiment each MSCML payload may be mapped to a unique HTML web form. The transformation engine may transmit the HTML web form with the validation results to the browser and the browser may display the HTML web form to the operator . When the identity of the caller is validated the operator may send a request to the application server to transfer the caller to the destination number for example by pushing a corresponding button on the HTML web form on the browser . The request may be in the form of an HTML web form and may be received by the transformation engine first. The transformation engine may transform the HTML web form to an MSCML payload and transmit the MSCML payload encapsulated in a SIP INFO request to the application server .

The application server may transmit instructions in a SIP INFO MSCML payload that may be transformed into a separate HTML page by the transformation engine . The instructions may be displayed by the browser to the operator and may instruct the operator to inform the caller of being directed to the destination number. The application server may terminate the session with the operator by sending a SIP INFO MSCML payload. The transformation engine may transform the MSCML payload to an HTML page and transmit the HTML page to the browser . Then the application server may transfer the caller to the destination number.

Turning to and a method is described. At block session initiation protocol SIP hypertext transfer protocol HTTP signaling transcoding is used to invite a customer care operator to a customer care session with a caller. For example the transformation engine may transcode session initiation protocol and hypertext transfer protocol codes to invite the customer care operator to a customer care session with a caller when the caller is a first responder. At block registered customer care operators are identified through a web real time communication WebRTC browser wherein the browser is an interface portal for the customer care operator. For example the operator may be asked to provide a personal identification number through the browser . The browser may be a web real time communication capable browser that conducts voice calling video chat and peer to peer file sharing without plugins. The authorization of the operator to handle certain call sessions for example a call from a first responder may also be determined.

At block the caller s disposition is displayed by the browser. For example if the caller chose to speak to the operator this disposition information may be displayed to the operator by the browser . Alternatively if the caller has failed a predefined number of personal identification number trials the caller may also be transferred to the operator . At block prior knowledge at a telephony application server TAS about the current customer care session is displayed. For example if the telephony application server has information that the caller called as a first responder in a disaster the telephony application server may transmit the information to the browser and the browser may display the information to the operator . This way time to ask why the caller called may be saved.

At block interactive hypertext markup language HTML web forms are displayed to the operator. For example hypertext markup language web forms may be displayed to the operator by the browser . Visual ring may be displayed to the operator in case of an incoming call. Interactive buttons may also be displayed to the operator on the hypertext markup language web forms. The operator may push the interactive buttons to control call sessions. For example the operator may push a drop button to reject an incoming call. At block SIP INFO media server control markup language MSCML payloads and HTML web forms are transcoded by a transformation engine. For example MSCML payloads embedded in a SIP INFO request may be transcoded to HTML web forms by the transformation engine . HTML web forms may also be transcoded to MSCML payloads by the transformation engine . The mobile device may communicate with the application server via a gateway for example a media gateway MGW with integrated services for digital network ISDN user part ISUP over message transfer part MTP which may be transformed by the media gateway into the session initiation protocol. The media gateway may communicate with the application server via the session initiation protocol. Additionally the application server may communicate with the media resource function via session initiation protocol. On the other hand the browser may not recognize session initiation protocol messages but may recognize hypertext transfer protocol messages. The transformation engine may transcode session initiation protocol messages and hypertext transfer protocol messages. Thus the browser may communicate with the application server via the transformation engine .

At block the HTML web forms transformed from SIP INFO MSCML payloads sent by an application server are transmitted to the operator. For example when the application server transmits MSCML payloads encapsulated in SIP INFO messages the transformation engine may obtain the MSCML payloads and transform the MSCML payloads to HTML web forms. Each MSCML payload may be mapped to a unique HTML web form. The transformed HTML web form may be transmitted via hypertext transfer protocol to the browser . The HTML web form may then be displayed to the operator by the browser . At block the SIP INFO MSCML payloads transformed from the HTML web forms sent by the operator are transmitted to the application server. For example when the operator inputs feedback to the browser via an HTML web form the browser may transmit the HTML web form to the application server . The transformation engine may obtain the HTML web form from the browser and transform the HTML web form to an MSCML payload encapsulated in a SIP INFO message. The transformation engine may transmit the transformed MSCML payload encapsulated in the SIP INFO message to the application server .

At block the interface portal is defined with instructions contained in the SIP INFO MSCML payloads. For example the interface portal the browser may be defined with instructions contained in the SIP INFO MSCML payloads from the application server . The transformation engine may transform the SIP INFO MSCML payloads to HTML web forms and the browser may define update the browser based on information in the HTML web forms. For example the browser may replace a current HTML web form displayed by the browser with a newly received HTML web form. At block instructions from the SIP INFO MSCML payloads are used to script the operator s communication with the caller. For example instructions from the SIP INFO MSCML payloads may be displayed on HTML web forms to script the operator s communication with the caller. In an embodiment the operator may be instructed to request answer s to personal identification related question s from the caller. The operator may input the answer s to the HTML web form. The HTML web form with the answer s may be transmitted by the browser transformed to an MSCML payload encapsulated in a SIP INFO message by the transformation engine and transmitted to the application server .

At block the caller s identity is validated at the application server . For example the answer s to the personal identification related question s may be validated at the application server . The validation results may be transmitted by the application server back to the browser and displayed to the operator . At block the caller is transferred to a destination number when the caller s identity is validated. For example the operator may be instructed to ask the caller for a destination number. When the identification of the caller is validated at the application server and the validation result is transmitted to the browser the operator may be instructed to transfer the caller to the destination number.

Turning now to a method is described. At block session initiation protocol SIP hypertext transfer protocol HTTP signaling transcoding is used to invite a customer care operator to a customer care session with a caller. For example session initiation protocol and hypertext transfer protocol codes may be transcoded by the transformation engine . The application server may transmit a request via session initiation protocol to the browser . The transformation engine may obtain the request in session initiation protocol code and transform the code to be transmitted via hypertext transfer protocol to the browser . When the request via hypertext transfer protocol is received at the browser the customer care operator may be invited to a customer care session with a caller by the browser . At block interactive hypertext markup language HTML web forms are displayed to the operator . For example visual ring may be displayed on an interactive HTML web form by the browser to the operator and the operator may choose to accept the call by pushing an accept button on the HTML web form.

At block a SIP INFO media server control markup language MSCML payload is mapped to an interactive HTML web form by the transformation engine . At block the HTML web forms transformed from SIP INFO MSCML payloads sent by the application server are transmitted to the operator . At block the SIP INFO MSCML payloads transformed from the HTML web forms sent by the operator are transmitted to the application server .

It is understood that by programming and or loading executable instructions onto the computer system at least one of the CPU the RAM and the ROM are changed transforming the computer system in part into a particular machine or apparatus having the novel functionality taught by the present disclosure. It is fundamental to the electrical engineering and software engineering arts that functionality that can be implemented by loading executable software into a computer can be converted to a hardware implementation by well known design rules. Decisions between implementing a concept in software versus hardware typically hinge on considerations of stability of the design and numbers of units to be produced rather than any issues involved in translating from the software domain to the hardware domain. Generally a design that is still subject to frequent change may be preferred to be implemented in software because re spinning a hardware implementation is more expensive than re spinning a software design. Generally a design that is stable that will be produced in large volume may be preferred to be implemented in hardware for example in an application specific integrated circuit ASIC because for large production runs the hardware implementation may be less expensive than the software implementation. Often a design may be developed and tested in a software form and later transformed by well known design rules to an equivalent hardware implementation in an application specific integrated circuit that hardwires the instructions of the software. In the same manner as a machine controlled by a new ASIC is a particular machine or apparatus likewise a computer that has been programmed and or loaded with executable instructions may be viewed as a particular machine or apparatus.

The secondary storage is typically comprised of one or more disk drives or tape drives and is used for non volatile storage of data and as an over flow data storage device if RAM is not large enough to hold all working data. Secondary storage may be used to store programs which are loaded into RAM when such programs are selected for execution. The ROM is used to store instructions and perhaps data which are read during program execution. ROM is a non volatile memory device which typically has a small memory capacity relative to the larger memory capacity of secondary storage . The RAM is used to store volatile data and perhaps to store instructions. Access to both ROM and RAM is typically faster than to secondary storage . The secondary storage the RAM and or the ROM may be referred to in some contexts as computer readable storage media and or non transitory computer readable media.
