This application is a continuation in part application of U.S. Non Provisional application Ser. No. 13 351 577 filed on Jan. 17 2012 which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 433 741 filed on Jan. 18 2011 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

One or more embodiments of the present invention relate to a fortified flashing laminate for installation in a roofing system. In certain embodiments the fortified flashing laminate may include a reinforcing layer of adhesive tape at one or more vulnerable areas of the flashing laminate.

The construction industry commonly uses single ply membranes to provide a waterproof barrier on flat or low slope roofs. It is prohibitively expensive and difficult to produce and transport a single membrane that is sized to cover an entire roof surface thus a plurality of individual membranes are often provided and oriented in an overlapping arrangement. The overlapping portions or splices of these individual membranes must be secured together to ensure that the plurality of membranes form a single waterproof surface.

In many cases flashings are used to seal certain locations of the roofing membranes where the membranes meet such as corners or walls. One type of flashing used is referred to as a tape flashing which is a laminate and includes a polymeric layer of thermosetting flashing material i.e. EPDM laminated to a layer of vulcanized tape adhesive. The polymeric layer may be provided in an uncured state and then cured by exposure to heat over time after being installed on the roof. The polymeric layer of the flashing laminates are formable when in the uncured state which facilitates installation of the flashing laminate by allowing it to conform to the underlying surfaces e.g. corners . However these uncured flashing laminates are susceptible to punctures slits cuts and impact damage as well as damage caused by building movement and or wall movement prior to curing of the polymeric layer.

Flashing laminates are often provided in specific sizes and shapes designed for installation at specific locations of the roofing system or edges of the membrane. For example flashing laminates may include those intended for installation at an outer corner of vertical walls at the base of curb surfaces around penetrations through the roofing system and at a metal flashing such as a gravel stop provided at the edge of the roof surface. Certain areas of these flashing laminates are particularly vulnerable to damage while the flashing is in an uncured state. Specifically the areas where the flashing laminate transitions from a horizontal surface to a vertical surface are particularly vulnerable. In addition areas at the outer corners of vertical surfaces can also be vulnerable to damage during installation of the flashing tape.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 204 148 discloses an improved laminate cover or patch for sealing an opening in a roofing membrane. The laminate cover includes a top sheet a lower sheet and a layer of flowable sealing material. The top sheet includes a weather resistant material and a complimentary shaped and sized lower sheet of a lightly cured butyl rubber having opposed tacky surfaces. The layer of a flowable sealing material such as an uncured butyl rubber sealing compound having a smaller dimension than that of the lower sheet is trapped between the bottom sheet and a bottom release coated carrier. The layer of flowable sealing material is designed to provide an improved seal over an opening in a roofing membrane and would not be effective in provided added tensile strength or puncture resistance to the laminate because the sealing material is uncured.

Thus there is a need for an improved flashing laminate that reduces the risk of damage to the flashing during installation and during the curing period without appreciably affecting the formability of the flashing laminate.

One or more embodiments of the present invention provide a fortified flashing laminate including a an uncured thermosetting polymeric layer having a top surface and a bottom surface b a first layer of vulcanized adhesive tape covering at least a portion of said bottom surface of said polymeric layer and c a reinforcing layer of vulcanized adhesive tape covering a portion of said first layer of vulcanized adhesive tape said reinforcing layer of vulcanized adhesive tape being smaller than said first layer of vulcanized adhesive tape.

One or more embodiments of the present invention also provides a fortified flashing laminate including a an uncured EPDM polymeric layer having a top surface and a bottom surface b a first layer of vulcanized adhesive tape covering substantially all of said bottom surface of said polymeric layer and c a second layer of vulcanized adhesive tape covering a portion of said first layer of vulcanized adhesive tape to form a fortified area of the flashing laminate.

One or more embodiments of the present invention also provides a roof assembly including a a roofing membrane secured over a roof deck b a curb penetrating the roof assembly and secured to the roof deck c a curb flashing covering the curb and d a flashing laminate covering the seam between said roofing membrane and said curb flashing said flashing laminate including i an uncured thermosetting polymeric layer having a top surface and a bottom surface ii a first layer of vulcanized adhesive tape covering substantially all of said bottom surface of said polymeric layer and iii a second layer of vulcanized adhesive tape covering a portion of said first layer of vulcanized adhesive tape to form a fortified area of said flashing laminate wherein said fortified area of said flashing laminate is positioned at the seam between said curb flashing and said roofing membrane.

One or more embodiments of the present invention also provides a roof assembly including a a roofing membrane secured over a roof deck b a roofing penetration extending upward through an opening in said roofing membrane and c a flashing laminate covering the edge of said opening around said penetration and secured to said roofing membrane and said penetration said flashing laminate including i an uncured thermosetting polymeric layer having a top surface and a bottom surface ii a first layer of vulcanized adhesive tape covering substantially all of said bottom surface of said polymeric layer and iii a second layer of vulcanized adhesive tape covering a portion of said first layer of vulcanized adhesive tape to form a fortified area of said flashing laminate wherein said fortified area of said flashing laminate is positioned over said edge of said opening.

One or more embodiments of the present invention also provides a method of making a flashing laminate including the steps of a forming a polymeric sheet having a top surface and a bottom surface b laminating a first layer of vulcanized adhesive tape to the bottom surface of the polymeric sheet and c securing a second layer of vulcanized adhesive tape to the first layer of vulcanized adhesive tape wherein the second layer of vulcanized adhesive tape is smaller than the first layer of vulcanized adhesive tape.

Flashing laminates made in accordance with the present invention include a polymeric layer laminated to a vulcanized adhesive tape layer and a second layer of vulcanized adhesive tape applied over a portion of the adhesive tape layer to create a fortified area of the flashing laminate. The second layer of vulcanized adhesive tape which may also be referred to as a reinforcing layer provides added strength to the fortified area of the flashing laminate. The reinforcing layer helps to reduce damage to the uncured polymeric layer of the flashing laminate during and after installation and prior to any substantial curing of the polymeric layer by increasing the tensile strength and puncture resistance of the flashing laminate at the area of coverage. The reinforcing layer of adhesive tape may be applied to specific and defined regions of the flashing laminate that are known to be vulnerable to damage when installed in certain locations in the roofing assembly.

The polymeric layer of the flashing laminate may be made from any thermosetting material also referred to as vulcanizable or curable materials known to those skilled in the art.

The flashing laminate of the present invention may be provided in a variety of various sizes and shapes to accommodate any number of installation situations. For example specific flashing laminates are manufactured for corner flashings where vertical surfaces form an exterior corner. A particular area that frequently provides a point of vulnerability in flashing applications is an intersection between horizontal and vertical surfaces that must be sealed. For instance the intersection of the roofing membrane and a curb flashing creates a vulnerable region where the two perpendicular surfaces intersect.

In one or more embodiments the flashing laminate of the present invention may also include a fortified area. In certain embodiments the fortified area is formed by applying a second layer of vulcanized adhesive tape to the existing adhesive tape on the bottom of the polymeric layer. The second layer of adhesive tape may also be referred to as a reinforcing layer. The second layer of adhesive tape may be applied together with the first layer of adhesive tape or may be applied as a supplemental step in the manufacturing process. In one or more embodiments the second layer of adhesive tape may be substantially identical to the first layer of adhesive tape in composition and or thickness. In other embodiments the second layer of adhesive tape may differ from the first layer of adhesive tape in composition and or thickness.

The second layer of vulcanized adhesive tape is applied in a particular region of the flashing laminate known to be vulnerable to damage during installation and during the curing period of the flashing laminate after being installed in a roofing system. The size and shape of the fortified area may vary according to the size and shape of the flashing laminate the intended use of the flashing laminate and the resulting vulnerable area of the flashing laminate. The additional layer of vulcanized adhesive tape increases the overall puncture resistance of the flashing laminate when tested using Puncture Resistance Testing ASTM D4833 as compared to identical flashing laminates without the second layer of vulcanized adhesive tape.

In addition the second layer of vulcanized adhesive tape applied at the fortified area increases the force necessary to extend and stretch the non vulcanized polymeric layer making the flashing laminate stronger and more resistant to damage from movement when subjected to Tensile and Elongation Testing according to ASTM D412. Furthermore the second layer of vulcanized adhesive tape applied at the fortified area increases the thickness of the vulcanized tape adhesive at vulnerable areas which reduces the potential for thinning of the flashing portion during installation acts as a cushion to reduce damage during and after installation and acts as a bridge between gaps at non supported areas to receive the flashing laminates.

In one or more embodiments a release liner may be provided over the adhesive layers of the flashing laminate to protect the adhesive and to prevent unintended adhesion. The release liner may include a polymeric film or coated paper to which the adhesive may form a temporary bond. However this bond can be readily broken by applying minimal tension. The release liner is easily removed by a technician immediately prior to installing the flashing laminate as part of a roofing system.

In one or more embodiments the release liner may include a paper or cellulosic structure coated with a polymeric coating. In other embodiments the release liner may include a homogeneous polymeric structure for example the release liner may include a polyester or polyolefin film. Suitable materials for the release liner include polypropylene polyester high density polyethylene medium density polyethylene low density polyethylene polystyrene or high impact polystyrene. Such polymeric materials offer a number of advantageous properties including high moisture resistance good resistance to temperature fluctuations during processing and storage high tear resistance. In one or more embodiments these release liners may also be provided with anti static surface coatings and or anti stick surface coatings. In addition to the above polymeric release liner materials the release liner may also be made of kraft paper.

Several examples of fortified flashing laminates are provided below as illustrative embodiments of the invention. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that conventional installation techniques may be employed in the installation of any embodiment of the flashing laminate despite the inclusion of a second layer of fortifying adhesive tape. For instance a primer may be applied between the adhesive tape and the surface to which it adheres to form a stronger adhesive bond. Although the primer layer is not shown or discussed in the illustrative embodiments herein it is contemplated that a primer may be applied to an underlying contact surface and allowed to dry prior to positioning and adhering the flashing laminate.

Flashing laminate assembly is installed around a roof penetration which may be an exhaust pipe as shown in the drawing. However it is contemplated that flashing laminate assembly could be utilized to seal a roofing system around any type of roof penetration known to those skilled in the art. Roof penetration extends upward through a roof deck an insulation board and a roofing membrane . A hood may optionally be provided adjacent the top of the penetration to direct precipitation away from the seams of the flashing laminate assembly and where provided a sealant may be included at a top edge of hood to prevent water infiltration between the hood and the penetration.

In yet another embodiment the flashing laminates of the present invention include multiple green polymeric layers with a tape layer e.g. vulcanized adhesive tape interleaved between the green polymeric layers. In one or more embodiments the laminates of the invention include a green polymeric layer and a tape layer in a first portion of the laminate and a green polymeric layer and a tape layer in a second portion of the laminate where the tape layer of the first portion is mated to the green polymeric layer of the first portion. In one or more embodiments the first portion may be referred to as the sealing portion of the laminate and the second portion may be referred to as the fortified area of the laminate. In one or more embodiments the sealing portion of the laminate has a larger planar surface than the fortified area of the laminate. In other words and consistent with the practice of the invention the fortified area offers additional strength to only a portion e.g. the most vulnerable portion of the sealing portion of the laminate.

For example depicts flashing laminate having first portion which may also be referred to as sealing portion which includes first green polymeric layer and tape layer . Flashing laminate also includes second portion which may also be referred to as fortified area which includes second green polymeric layer and second tape layer . In one or more embodiments first green polymeric layer and tape layer are coextensive i.e. they have the same width . In these or other embodiments second green polymeric layer and second tape layer are coextensive. In these or other embodiments and as shown in sealing portion includes a larger planar surface than fortified area . In other words in one or more embodiments the width of sealing portion in a given direction is larger than the corresponding width of fortified area in that same direction. As a result of this configuration fortified area only covers a portion of first tape layer thereby forming an exposed area . Flashing laminate may also include prior to installation release liner which may be disposed over second tape layer as well as exposed area . Release liner may include those release liners described above with respect to other embodiments. Additionally flashing laminate may optionally include a second release liner which may be disposed over the exposed surface of first green polymeric layer i.e. on the top surface of layer .

As with the other embodiments described herein first and second tape layers and may include vulcanized adhesive tape. In these or other embodiments the vulcanized adhesive tape layers and may be similarly characterized. For example they may be compositionally the same and may have similar thickness. Likewise first and second green polymeric layers and may be similarly characterized. For example they may be compositionally the same and may similar thickness.

It has advantageously been discovered that the flashing laminates of these embodiments i.e. those embodiments where the laminates include multiple polymeric layers not only demonstrate advantages due to the increased fortification offered by the second polymeric layer which is disposed in the fortified area but also offer manufacturing advantages. For example during manufacture of the laminate a first laminate can be formed by mating a green polymeric sheet to a tape. This laminate can then be further fabricated by shaping e.g. cutting the laminate to a desired configuration. Excess material from the first laminate can then be shaped to a desired configuration and mated with the first laminate to form the fortified area of the laminate.

Additionally the skilled person will understand the laminates of these embodiments i.e. those where the laminate includes multiple polymeric layers can be used in the various assemblies described above. Namely the flashing laminates of these embodiments can be employed as a corner flashing laminate as shown in as a linear flashing used in combination with a metal curb as shown in as a flashing installed around a roof penetration as shown in and as a linear flashing installed on a roof gutter flange as shown in .

Various modifications and alterations that do not depart from the scope and spirit of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art. This invention is not to be unduly limited to the illustrative embodiments set forth herein.
